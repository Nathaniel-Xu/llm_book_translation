Han Li gazed out at the Blood Red City, his divine sense scanning the area. He rubbed his nose, muttering to himself, "This place is filled with a chilling aura, it's as if we've truly entered the underworld."

The city was quite large, but what was strange was that there was no sign of life anywhere. Not a single person, not even a living animal, could be found.

It was as if the city was a ghost town, devoid of any vitality.

Ti Hu didn't speak, her eyes fixed on the space behind the city.

Han Li followed her gaze, his heart skipping a beat.

In the air behind the city, a large black cloud floated, its presence starkly contrasting with the blood-red surroundings.

The cloud seemed to be alive, slowly rotating, and Han Li could sense that there was something within it. However, the cloud emitted a powerful, formless energy that prevented his divine sense from penetrating.

Han Li pondered for a moment before activating his Nine Yin Magic Eyes, gazing into the cloud.

Suddenly, the cloud shuddered violently, and a tremendous pressure burst forth, causing the air around Han Li to tremble. His vision was forced back, and he felt a sharp pain in his eyes, with two lines of blood tears flowing from the corners.

"Master!" Ti Hu exclaimed, seeing Han Li's reaction.

"I'm fine," Han Li replied, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. "This black cloud is too unusual, let's not investigate it further."

A moment later, Han Li opened his eyes, which had returned to normal.

"This place doesn't feel right, let's leave," Ti Hu suggested, glancing at the black cloud and then the Blood Red City.

"This blood-red space is quite stable, and we can't just leave. Since we've come this far, let's take a look," Han Li said, leading the way towards the city.

Ti Hu followed closely, her eyes fixed on the black cloud.

As they landed before the city gate, Han Li saw that the doors were open, revealing a wide, empty street. The buildings on either side were all grand and imposing, with their doors and windows open.

However, the city was eerily silent, devoid of any signs of life.

Ti Hu's eyebrows furrowed, and she instinctively moved closer to Han Li.

"Let's go," Han Li said, stepping into the city.

As they entered the city, Han Li felt a sudden shiver run down his spine, but he didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.

He glanced at Ti Hu, who seemed unaffected.

With their speed, they quickly explored the city, finding that it was fully equipped with all the necessary facilities, just like a normal city in the True Immortal Realm. However, there was no one in sight.

"How is this possible?" Han Li muttered. "Could it be that the people here were just taken away?"

As they stood in a resident's room, Ti Hu suddenly spoke up, "I know what's going on, Master. Follow me."

She rushed out of the room, pulling Han Li along, and they soon found themselves back at the blood-red lake.

"What did you discover?" Han Li asked.

Ti Hu jumped into the lake, submerging her body and leaving only her head exposed.

Han Li didn't follow, instead using his divine sense to scan the lake.

The lake water was filled with a faint, cold aura, but nothing else seemed out of the ordinary.

"Ah, Master, come quickly!" Ti Hu exclaimed, her face filled with excitement.

Han Li hesitated for a moment before joining her in the lake.

As soon as he entered the water, his eyebrows furrowed, and his face twisted in discomfort.
As soon as his body was submerged in the lake water, his entire body was wracked with intense pain, as if being cut by a knife and burned by fire, causing him to shudder uncontrollably. His eyes were also shrouded in a layer of mist, making it difficult to see anything clearly.

If it were just ordinary pain, Han Li wouldn't have been bothered, but the pain he was experiencing now seemed to be directly affecting his soul, making it difficult for him to endure even with his strong willpower.

It was as if an invisible force had wrapped itself around his entire body, peeling away something from his body and soul.

"Master, this lake water is the Three Lives Water, which can wash away the yang energy from a person's body. Just bear with it for a bit, it will be over soon," Qiuhun said urgently from the side.

Han Li gritted his teeth and closed his eyes, enduring the pain.

After a full quarter of an hour, the pain finally began to subside and eventually disappeared. At this point, he felt no discomfort, and instead, he felt a sense of comfort from being submerged in the lake water.

Han Li let out a deep breath, opened his eyes, and saw that his vision had returned to normal. He was about to stand up from the lake when Qiuhun suddenly stretched out her hand and pressed down on him, preventing him from leaving.

"Master, wait a moment, take a look at the city," Qiuhun said in a low voice.

Han Li looked in the direction of the Blood City and his eyes widened in surprise.

Originally, the Blood City was empty, but now there were two rows of guards wearing blood-red armor standing in front of it.

Although the guards looked human, they had a single horn on their heads, long mouths, and large ears. Their tongues were also long and kept sticking out, as if they were panting like dogs. Their appearance was both frightening and comical.

Through the city gate, Han Li saw that the originally empty city was now bustling with activity, with people coming and going.

Moreover, the sky above the Blood Lake was filled with people, all wearing blood-red armor, holding chains, and carrying people who were struggling. They were throwing these people into the Blood Lake.

Those people let out ear-piercing screams as they entered the lake, and their bodies began to emit a faint blue smoke, as if they were being corroded by the lake water.

However, after a short while, the blue smoke disappeared, and their bodies became semi-transparent. They were then taken by the blood-armored guards and brought to the city gate, where they were inspected before being taken into the Blood City.

The blood-armored guards seemed to be unaware of Han Li and Qiuhun's presence, as if they couldn't see them.

Han Li was shocked by what he was seeing.

"These blood-armored guards are the Soul Reapers of the Underworld, who go to the True Immortal Realm to collect the souls of the dead. They wash away the yang energy from their bodies in the Three Lives Lake and then bring them to the Underworld," Qiuhun explained.

"It seems to be the case... but Qiuhun, how do you know all this?" Han Li asked curiously.

"I'm not sure, but when I washed away the yang energy from my body in the Three Lives Lake, some memories suddenly appeared in my mind," Qiuhun replied.

"How did you have these memories?" Han Li asked, surprised.

"I'm not sure, maybe it's because I'm a demonic beast, and I have some connection to the Underworld," Qiuhun said, shaking her head.

"Maybe," Han Li said, nodding.

Although there were still many unanswered questions, the bizarre scene before him was enough to make him wonder.

"I used to think that the Underworld was just a myth, but it seems to be real... but why can't these Soul Reapers see us?" Han Li asked, sighing.

"These Soul Reapers and us cultivators are like yin and yang, we can't see each other. Only the dead or those who have washed away their yang energy in the Three Lives Water can see each other. To be safe, I used a special secret technique to conceal our auras, so the Soul Reapers can't see us. But I'm not sure if this technique will work," Qiuhun explained.

"I see," Han Li said, nodding silently. After a moment of thought, he suddenly leaped out of the lake and flew towards the city gate.

"Master, I said I wasn't sure if it would work!" Qiuhun exclaimed, following closely behind.

Fortunately, Qiuhun's secret technique was more effective than she had expected, and they were not discovered.

The city gate was guarded by only a few Soul Reapers, and there were no magical instruments that could detect them. Therefore, Han Li and Qiuhun were able to enter the city undetected.

"Master, I told you it was uncertain, but you still rushed out. This is too reckless," Qiuhun complained.

"I believe your secret technique will work, and even if it doesn't, there's no point in hiding in the lake," Han Li said with a calm smile.

"What's your plan next, Master?" Qiuhun asked.

"Follow these people and see what they do with these souls," Han Li said, pointing to the Soul Reapers inside the city.

The Soul Reapers were leading a procession of souls, walking in a line, and were very conspicuous. The originally desolate streets were now filled with people, and many were watching the Soul Reapers with curiosity.

Han Li and Qiuhun blended in with the crowd and followed the Soul Reapers from a distance. They soon arrived at a large building.

The Soul Reapers led the souls into the building, and Han Li and Qiuhun followed, exchanging a glance to confirm that there was nothing unusual outside.
