Han Li's body was instantly restrained by a powerful force of law as he crossed the golden light screen. His entire body was wrapped in golden threads, and he was suspended in mid-air, unable to move.

He glanced down and saw that he was above a lush and dense forest, which seemed to be only a few hundred miles wide. The edges were shrouded in a thick gray mist, and it was clear that this was a small, secret realm.

In the forest, the trees were dense, and he could see a winding path made of bluestone that led to a golden mansion in the distance.

"Such a dense temporal law!" Han Li exclaimed, looking at the golden threads wrapped around his body.

The feeling was as if he was being restrained by the True Speech Treasure Wheel, but his mind was not affected. Instead, his body was being cut by the sharp golden threads, although they had not broken through, they still felt extremely painful.

As he pondered, his expression suddenly changed, and he saw that two massive golden figures had appeared in the distance, charging towards him with a loud roar.

Han Li looked closely and saw that they were two giant tigers with golden fur, as if they had been cast in gold. They had two golden wings on their sides, but they were relatively small compared to their massive bodies and could not fly.

As they charged forward, their golden wings flapped continuously, and their bodies slowly rose into the air, charging towards Han Li.

"These are... metal beasts?" Han Li muttered to himself.

These strange beasts were not actually beasts, but were formed from the condensation of pure gold attribute primordial energy. In this golden source mountain range, they were extremely difficult to deal with.

As he thought, the True Speech Treasure Wheel in his body began to reverse, and the temporal law force began to fluctuate, trying to reach a balance with the golden threads wrapped around his body.

As the temporal law force in his body surged out, the golden threads wrapped around his body began to release themselves, but the speed was slow.

Only after a dozen breaths, Han Li still had hundreds of golden threads wrapped around his body, and the two metal beasts had already arrived in front of him.

The two metal beasts opened their mouths wide, revealing sharp golden teeth, and bit down on Han Li's head and waist.

Just as their mouths were about to bite down, a silver firebird suddenly burst out of Han Li's shoulder, transforming into a giant silver firebird with wings that blazed with fierce flames, striking the two metal beasts.

The two metal beasts were hit head-on, and their bodies were pressed down to the ground.

The metal beasts let out a loud roar, and their mouths opened wide, biting down on the silver firebird's wings.

The silver firebird let out a loud cry, and its wings were torn apart, with large pieces of flame being ripped off.

The metal beasts chewed on the flames, and their bodies seemed to be unaffected by the intense heat.

Han Li saw this and raised an eyebrow. The silver firebird's flames were extremely powerful, and he was surprised that the metal beasts could withstand them.

However, he did not look any further, and instead focused on using the True Speech Treasure Wheel to reverse the temporal law force, trying to balance it with the golden threads wrapped around his body.

The silver firebird, after being bitten by the metal beasts, did not retreat. Instead, it spread its wings and dived down, crashing into the metal beasts like a fireball.

The metal beasts were surrounded by a fierce silver flame, and the temperature inside the flame increased rapidly, causing the metal beasts' bodies to emit a faint golden mist.

Han Li saw this and remembered that the metal beasts were formed from the condensation of pure gold attribute primordial energy. The mist that was emitted was likely the same energy.

Just then, the two metal beasts let out a loud roar and charged towards each other, colliding head-on.

The sound of the collision was like thunder, and a blinding golden light flashed out, carrying an intense force that cut through the surrounding silver flames.

The two metal beasts broke free from the silver flames and escaped.
The Yin Flame Bird was split in two, with the two flames rushing to recombine, but a layer of golden light prevented them from merging.

The metal beast, now out of control, ignored the Yin Flame Bird and charged towards Han Li, its four legs pounding the ground as it let out a deafening roar.

Han Li, however, had already broken free from the golden threads that bound him. With a single glance, he took a step forward, his arms vibrating as he activated the Great Strength Golden Ape technique.

A burst of starlight erupted from his arms, and two massive fists imbued with crystal energy crashed down onto the metal beasts' foreheads, producing a deafening "clang" sound.

The two metal beasts were sent crashing to the ground, their bodies trembling under the force of Han Li's blows. The earth shook beneath their impact, and the air was filled with the sound of their collapse.

Han Li descended from the sky, glancing at the Yin Flame Bird, which was still trying to recombine. He then chased after the metal beasts, delivering a flurry of punches that sent them tumbling to the ground.

The earth shook beneath the relentless barrage of punches, and the sound of Han Li's blows echoed through the air. After over a hundred punches, the ground was scarred and battered, and Han Li finally stopped, fearing that he would damage the secret realm's foundation.

However, when he stopped, he noticed that the metal beasts were nowhere to be seen. Han Li flew down into the crater, only to discover that the two metal beasts had escaped through a tunnel they had dug.

"Let's go and get revenge, then we'll find a way to remove the golden light and restore you to your original state," Han Li said, his mind connecting with the Yin Flame Bird.

The bird ceased its attempts to recombine and transformed into two small silver birds, which perched on Han Li's shoulders.

Han Li glanced at the tunnel entrance, his divine sense probing the interior before he flew in.

The tunnel was damp and musty, filled with the scent of damp earth. Han Li traversed the tunnel for over ten miles, his nose wrinkled in distaste, before coming across a fork in the road.

As he approached the fork, his brow furrowed in surprise. The tunnel he had been following intersected with a larger, smoother tunnel that seemed to have been excavated long ago.

A warm breeze emanated from the larger tunnel, and Han Li sensed that it was incredibly hot. A sly smile spread across his face as he said, "Ah, little one, you're in for a treat..."

With a flick of his body, Han Li entered the larger tunnel, his eyes scanning the area before he moved forward.

The tunnel twisted and turned, stretching for over ten miles before opening up into a vast underground chamber. Han Li emerged from the tunnel, his eyes widening as he took in the sight before him.

A massive, hundred-yard-wide pool of five-colored flames dominated the center of the chamber, its surface churning with waves of intense heat. The two metal beasts that had escaped earlier were now feasting on a massive golden mineral, their bodies glowing with a golden aura as they devoured the mineral.

The metal beasts' eyes locked onto Han Li, and they immediately became alert, their bodies tensing as they prepared to attack. However, they seemed to recall Han Li's previous display of strength and hesitated, choosing not to charge forward.

"Ah, I see," Han Li said, a smile spreading across his face. "No wonder they were able to withstand the flames. They must have been living near this five-colored flame pool and feeding on the golden minerals."

The two silver birds on Han Li's shoulders seemed to sense the power of the flame pool and began to flutter excitedly.

"Go ahead," Han Li said, his voice filled with amusement.

The two silver birds spread their wings and dived towards the flame pool, their forms blurring as they descended. The two metal beasts, sensing the birds' approach, immediately sprang into action, their bodies launching into the air as they prepared to attack.

"Get down!" Han Li bellowed, his eyes flashing with anger.

With a swift movement, Han Li appeared beneath the metal beasts, his hands grasping their tails as he yanked them back down to the ground.

The metal beasts crashed to the earth, their bodies rolling wildly as they struggled to free themselves. Han Li's body began to glow with a golden aura as his true spirit blood vessels activated, and he transformed into a massive golden ape.

The ape's massive hands pressed down on the metal beasts' heads, pinning them to the ground. The metal beasts' bodies thrashed about, their tails flailing wildly as they tried to break free, but Han Li's grip was unyielding.
