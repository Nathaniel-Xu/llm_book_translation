Lan Yan's hand grasped a weapon resembling a long-handled curved sickle, its blade tip embedded with three blocks of water-blue crystals that flashed with clear light.

The man standing behind her, Lan Yuanzi, held a slender long sword with three blocks of water-blue crystals, its movements creating layer upon layer of water-blue light waves.

Together, they calmly faced the two metal beasts resembling ferocious lions.

"These metal beasts are of a high grade, and their cores must contain the power of the golden law. Let's kill a few more, shall we?" Lan Yan's body flowed with water-like movements as she smiled.

"Compared to the treasure in the Years Tower, these metal beasts are nothing to worry about. We should focus on finding a way out, wasting time here is meaningless." Lan Yuanzi shook his head, saying.

"This is also good, there are so many metal beasts, killing them would be a bother. Let's go deeper and take a look." Lan Yan's excitement grew.

"You shouldn't be too careless, these things have strong attacks, if you're not careful, you'll get hurt." Lan Yuanzi's voice was more serious, warning.

As they spoke, the two metal beasts charged again.

Lan Yan's foot lightly touched the ground, and she floated up, jumping into the air.

She raised one hand, and a point of empty space appeared, with a sheet of blue light rippling out from her fingertips, condensing into a water-blue light screen.

The light screen displayed a series of ring-shaped symbols, emitting a strong water-attribute aura.

The metal beast that charged towards her crashed into the light screen, causing a massive shockwave.

The water-blue light screen was like a stormy rain, with countless blue water droplets swirling on its surface, but it remained solid and unbroken, firmly resisting the metal beast's attack.

Almost simultaneously, Lan Yan's other hand grasped a blue curved sickle, which drew a blue light arc in the air, resembling a blue crescent moon.

With a sharp cry, Lan Yan's water-blue light screen split open, and the metal beast behind it was sliced in two by the blue crescent moon.

On the other side, Lan Yuanzi was more direct, without any defensive movements, and instead charged forward, his water-blue slender sword slicing through the air, creating a spiral water light that shot towards the metal beast's forehead.

A soft "puff" sound was heard.

The metal beast's head, which should have been incredibly hard, was pierced by the water light, creating a massive hole.

Yu Kuo Hai, who was fleeing in panic, saw this scene and was shocked.

It turned out that there were more people like "Stone Daoist" who were pretending to be weak. From now on, he wouldn't dare to underestimate those who seemed unremarkable.

At this moment, he noticed that "Stone Daoist" glanced at him, and his heart skipped a beat. Fortunately, he only looked at him briefly and didn't take any action.

Despite this, Yu Kuo Hai's heart was still racing, and he subconsciously distanced himself from the three, fleeing towards the other side, afraid of being killed by them.

Han Li, however, was too busy to deal with Yu Kuo Hai, and his gaze had turned towards the other side because his divine sense had detected something. It seemed that there was an even stronger metal beast approaching.

He turned his gaze back to the Lan siblings, his brow furrowed in concern, but their figures had already disappeared.

Han Li was puzzled, and just as he was about to investigate, a loud cry echoed from above.

The golden eagle that had attacked him earlier had returned, and it was now targeting him again.

"Shut up!" Han Li's brow furrowed, and he raised a fist, striking upwards.

The golden eagle was about to land when it was hit by Han Li's fist, causing a burst of golden light.

A loud explosion was heard, and the golden eagle's steel claws were shattered by the incoming starlight.

Its broken body flew to the side, where it was swallowed by a metal beast resembling a qilin.

The qilin let out a deafening roar, its back glowing with golden light, and two golden wings sprouted from its back.

Han Li saw the qilin's appearance and sensed that it was the source of the powerful aura he had detected earlier.

The qilin metal beast charged towards Han Li, its four legs pounding the ground.

Its massive mouth opened, and a stream of golden liquid shot out, pouring down towards Han Li.

Han Li's wrist turned, and the Qingtong Huo Yun sword appeared, which he grasped firmly, swinging it with a powerful motion.

The Qingtong Huo Yun sword's golden light and blue sword energy merged, creating a blue light screen that surged upwards, clashing with the golden liquid.

The two forces collided, and the golden liquid was cut into thin strands by the golden light, which then split into fine threads.

However, the golden liquid had also weakened the golden light, and it was subsequently torn apart by the blue sword energy.
Han Li flew up from the opening torn open by the sword energy, and charged straight at the Qilin metal beast.

The Qilin saw this and flapped its newly grown wings, creating a whirlwind of golden wind that blew out from beneath its wings, like a series of golden blades that sliced through the air, cutting through the void and causing it to shatter.

Han Li's path was blocked by the golden wind, and his footstep echoed with a loud "thud".

He stepped on the void, his body rising step by step, crossing over the golden wind area and arriving at the Qilin's head. He suddenly raised his fist and struck downwards.

"Boom boom boom..."

The void shook violently, and a powerful pressure emanated from Han Li's fist, suppressing the golden light that filled the surrounding void. His fist struck the Qilin's head with a loud "boom".

The Qilin's massive body collapsed, its four legs splayed out, and it fell to the ground.

Although its massive head had not split open, it swayed back and forth, as if it was struggling to maintain its balance.

Han Li landed on the Qilin's head, his face filled with hesitation.

After a moment, he raised his fingers to his brow and pressed down, then pulled outwards.

A thin, white crystal thread emerged from his fingers, like a floating spirit snake that danced at his fingertips.

"Go!"

Han Li pointed his fingers, and the crystal thread shot out, striking the Qilin's head and disappearing into it.

The crystal thread vanished, and the Qilin's head, which had been swaying, suddenly drooped downwards, as if it had fallen asleep.

Han Li's right hand flashed with light, and a massive silver light gate appeared in front of the Qilin.

"Enter, and from now on, take care of the household and protect the courtyard." Han Li said, his body flashing backwards as he kicked the Qilin's buttocks, sending it tumbling into the light gate.

He then closed the flower branch cave, his gaze turning towards a direction in the distance.

A blue-green light curtain appeared, rippling out from the golden light. A pair of handsome young men, resembling a pair of divine lovers, walked out from the light.

Han Li looked closely, and it was indeed the Lan siblings.

"This is indeed a treasure of the cave, no wonder it could plunder such a large area of the secret realm. But to do something like scraping the ground, Han Li, your methods are really too unbecoming." Lan Yan said with a smile, covering her mouth.

"When did you discover my identity?" Han Li asked, his brow furrowed.

"We've been watching you, Han Li, and we wouldn't have noticed you if you hadn't been so careful." Lan Yuanzi said calmly.

" Lan siblings... you..." Han Li looked at the intimate appearance of the two, and felt a bit uncomfortable.

Lan Yan saw this, and her expression became slightly unnatural, her voice rising in anger.

"I and my brother are fellow disciples, we were both taken in by our master and followed his surname. Only someone as rude as you would think such impure thoughts."

Lan Yuanzi, however, remained calm and natural.

"What's between you two is none of my concern. I had hoped that you wouldn't cause any trouble, and we could avoid a fight. But now it seems... that's not possible?" Han Li's gaze turned, and he said.

"We don't want to fight, Han Li. If you surrender now, we can take you back to the Jiuyuan Observatory and let the old ancestor deal with you." Lan Yuanzi said with a light smile.

"How is it that people from the Jiuyuan Observatory like to joke around like this? The last person who spoke like this was Dongfang Bai, I don't know if you know him." Han Li smiled wryly, and asked.

Lan Yan heard this, and her face turned red with anger.

Her hand grasped the sickle, and she was about to strike Han Li, but was stopped by Lan Yuanzi.

"Don't be provoked, this person is not simple. He can kill a palace lord, kill Dongfang Bai, and must be dealt with carefully." Lan Yuanzi said.

Lan Yan's expression eased slightly, and she gazed at Han Li, her hand gripping the sickle tightly.

"Since Han Li wants to fight, let's see who's stronger." Lan Yuanzi's expression turned serious, and he drew his sword, making a light slash in front of him.

As he spoke, a blue-green light enveloped him, and a spherical light curtain expanded, covering an area of several hundred meters around him.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he sensed that the golden energy in the surrounding void had become much weaker, and the metal beasts seemed to have been driven away by this spiritual domain.

As for the cultivators from the Wangyou Pavilion and the Lingxiao Sect, they had already been killed or injured, with very few remaining.

"This spiritual domain is quite special, but it doesn't seem to have any killing power, and yet it can drive away the metal beasts." Han Li said in surprise.
