It's enough that the Blue siblings have taken action, why must I be sent to deal with Han Li, who is only a Taiyi realm cultivator?" Huang Zhanchu, the yellow toad, let out a disdainful snort.

"According to rumors, Han Li cultivates the Time Law, one of the three supreme laws, and has made significant progress. We must not underestimate him. Only the Blue siblings can be trusted, and I am not confident in anyone else. You must go to the location, keep your identity hidden, and act in secret. You must strike with one blow and ensure success." Miao Fa Xian Zun shook his head and said.

Chu Zhanchu's expression remained unchanged, but a hint of dissatisfaction flashed in his six eyes.

Is it really necessary to send me, a Da Luo cultivator, to deal with a mere Taiyi realm cultivator? And to make matters worse, I have to hide in the shadows and launch a sneak attack? It's an insult to my abilities.

"This is a matter of great importance, and we cannot afford to make any mistakes. If you fail, you will be held accountable!" Miao Fa Xian Zun's eyes turned cold.

"Yes, I will go and transmit the message." Chu Zhanchu stood up, and his body began to shrink rapidly, transforming into a fat, yellow-faced woman.

The woman's body flashed, and she transformed into a yellow shadow that merged with the ground, disappearing from sight.

Miao Fa Xian Zun gazed at the empty space in front of him before disappearing into thin air.

...

In the Golden Source Immortal Palace, Dongfang Bai walked out of the transmission hall, his anxious expression replaced by a calm demeanor.

As long as the people from the Golden Source Immortal Palace arrive, capturing Han Li will be a trivial matter. At that time, he will make Han Li pay for the humiliation he suffered.

Dongfang Bai thought of several cruel methods to torture Han Li, and his heart felt a sense of satisfaction.

"Someone, come here!" Dongfang Bai called out.

A beam of light shot towards him from a distance, and a young man with a cold, stern expression appeared before him.

"Palace Master, what are your orders?" the young man asked.

"Black Knife and LÃ¼ Yun were defeated and killed during our previous mission. From now on, you will be the leader of the 'Dark Sword' faction. Send out all the spies in the 'Dark Sword' faction and contact the hidden agents in various locations. You must find out Han Li's whereabouts." Dongfang Bai instructed.

"Yes!" The young man's eyes lit up with excitement, and he bowed to acknowledge the order.

Just then, a muffled sound came from a distance, and the ground shook violently. The nearby halls trembled, and a loud rumbling sound echoed through the air.

"What's going on?" Dongfang Bai's brow furrowed, and he looked outside.

"I'll go and take a look," the young man said, ready to fly out.

At that moment, a figure appeared before them, covered in blood and wearing a golden robe.

"Palace Master, it's not good! Someone has invaded the palace, and we can't hold them back!" the man exclaimed.

"What kind of person dares to cause trouble in the Golden Source Immortal Palace?" Dongfang Bai's eyes flashed with anger, and he was about to fly out, but his expression changed, and he stopped.

He expanded his divine sense, scanning the entrance of the palace, and his face changed.

...

The entrance of the palace, once grand and majestic, was now in shambles. Over a dozen halls had collapsed, reduced to rubble.

In the air, more than a hundred palace cultivators, led by five black-robed old men, formed a semicircular battle array.

The five old men were almost identical in height and appearance, as if they were brothers. They emitted a cold, sinister aura.

The palace cultivators were mostly in the True Immortal realm, while the five black-robed old men were Taiyi realm cultivators.

Various immortal artifacts and secret techniques rained down from the battle array, attacking the opponent.

However, the opponent was a single person.

He was a young man in a blue robe, surrounded by four or five dozen golden flying swords that swirled around him like fish, creating a dense, golden sword shadow that easily deflected the attacks.

At the same time, the young man's fingers flicked, and another dozen golden flying swords shot out from his sleeves, transforming into ten or more hundred-meter-long golden sword auras that descended like divine swords, emitting a thunderous roar.

The sword auras had not yet landed, but they created a long, white sword scar in the sky, as if the heavens themselves were being torn apart.

The five Taiyi realm old men's faces changed, and they immediately transformed into a cross shape, each spitting out a black flag with a ferocious black dragon pattern.

The five men made a series of hand seals, and the black flags expanded, growing several times larger, emitting a rustling sound.

A massive, sticky black cloud emerged from the flags, engulfing the sword auras. The air seemed to corrode, emitting a hissing sound.

The nearby Golden Immortal cultivators retreated in fear, avoiding the black cloud like a snake.

"Dark energy!" the young man's eyebrows rose, and he moved his fingers.

The golden sword auras on the surface of the black cloud emitted a hissing sound, as if they were being corroded. However, they also produced a series of thick, golden lightning arcs, releasing a powerful, righteous energy that clashed with the black cloud.
Dark clouds churned violently, suddenly emitting a thunderous crash, as if encountering their arch-nemesis, transforming into countless wisps of black smoke that dispersed and vanished.

Those golden sword auras instantly tore through the dark clouds, striking towards the five Taizhen realm elders behind.

The five elders' faces changed drastically, their bodies flashing with black energy, their tall figures suddenly shrinking drastically in the explosion, instantly transforming into three-foot-tall dwarves, dodging to the side with incredible speed, barely avoiding the golden sword auras.

The golden sword auras did not pursue the five elders, instead falling upon the True Immortals and Golden Immortals behind them.

"Ahhh!"

Blood-curdling screams erupted as the sword auras swept through the crowd, creating waves of blood, severed limbs, and mangled bodies, with not a single True Immortal escaping unscathed. Moreover, a full third of the Golden Immortals fell, with the remaining Golden Immortals fleeing in terror, the Half-Month War Array instantly collapsing.

Han Li's cultivation had made great strides, and the power of the Qingtian Bee Cloud Sword had increased accordingly.

The five Taizhen elders' bodies suddenly snapped back into their original form, their faces twisted in rage.

The surrounding Golden Immortals were all pillars of the Jinyuan Immortal Palace, and now they had been annihilated by the dozens.

"Who are you, sir? How dare you slaughter our people like this! You'll be pursued by the Heavenly Court's endless wanted notices!" one of the elders thundered.

The blue-robed man's face remained expressionless, as if he hadn't heard the elder's words, raising his hand to flick his fingers once more.

The dozen or so sword auras trembled, then shot out again, transforming into illusions that pursued the other Golden Immortals, with several more Golden Immortals being pierced and killed in an instant.

The five Taizhen realm elders' faces turned ashen, their eyes fixed on the depths of the palace, as if waiting for something to happen, but nothing did.

"Ahhh!" "Ahhh!" Two more Golden Immortals were pierced and killed.

The five elders' faces grew even more somber, and they were about to charge forward recklessly when a dozen or so dazzling green lights descended from the sky, transforming into a dozen green serpents.

These green serpents were incredibly fast and agile, their massive bodies wrapping around the golden sword auras.

Threads of green energy shot out from the serpents, entwining the fierce golden sword auras.

The golden sword auras trembled, electric arcs flashing, as the green threads instantly shattered, but more green energy shot out from the serpents, continuing to entwine the sword auras.

Breaking one thread, three more would grow; breaking ten threads, a hundred more would grow!

In the span of a few breaths, the golden sword auras' luster had dulled significantly, and their size had shrunk considerably.

Innumerable green threads entwined the sword auras, forming a massive cocoon that enveloped them.

The blue-robed man's eyes flickered, his hand weaving a seal.

The golden sword auras suddenly shrank, transforming into a small golden sword the size of a foot, which slashed through the air.

"Shh!" The green cocoon was instantly torn apart, the golden sword auras flying out, swirling around the blue-robed man.

A figure descended from the sky, none other than Dongfang Bai.

The dozen or so green serpents flew back, shrinking rapidly, and linking together, forming a dozen cyan rings that floated around him.

The palace's inhabitants were shocked to see Dongfang Bai's figure.

"The palace master has arrived!"

"This kid, our palace master is here, and your time is up!"

"Palace master, this person has committed atrocities, slaughtering many of our people, and today he will not be allowed to leave this place alive!"

The palace's inhabitants flew to Dongfang Bai's side, their faces twisted in anger.

Dongfang Bai ignored the crowd, his eyes fixed on the blue-robed man, a smile spreading across his face.

"Ah, Han Li, I admit your strength is formidable, but you dare to slaughter our people like this? You're bold, indeed!"

"East Bai, you've come out yourself, saving me the trouble! You slaughtered the Qinghuo tribe without reason, killing 57,300 people, your crimes are heinous, and today is your day of reckoning!" The blue-robed man, Han Li, looked up at Dongfang Bai, his voice dripping with malice.

The crowd's expressions changed, many looking at Dongfang Bai with suspicion.

The Heavenly Court had long since decreed that wanton slaughter of the weak was forbidden, and violators would be punished severely. Han Li's words seemed too certain to be mere rumors.

"The Qinghuo tribe sheltered you, a wanted man on the Immortal Execution List, and attacked my search party, they deserved to die!" Dongfang Bai's brow furrowed, responding immediately.

"Enough, today I've come to take your life, to offer sacrifice to the Qinghuo tribe's departed souls, come and meet your end!" Han Li didn't bother to argue further, his hands weaving a seal.

The dozens of Qingtian Bee Cloud Swords swirling around him trembled, shooting towards Dongfang Bai, emitting a piercing sword cry.

Dongfang Bai saw this and responded by weaving a seal.

A crisp sound erupted as the green rings around him flew out, transforming into a dozen green serpents, which shot out innumerable green threads that entwined the Qingtian Bee Cloud Swords.
