The eight desolate mountains trembled, and a flash of light illuminated the surroundings. Several figures instantly appeared.

The Blood Gate of the Asura, which had stood for over a hundred years, finally vanished in an instant, returning to nothingness.

On the mountain top square, the dark red seal had been lifted, and the area was bathed in the morning light, as if coated with a layer of gold, radiating a dazzling glow.

Han Li took a deep breath of the fresh air, narrowed his eyes, and gazed at the distant sunrise.

Suddenly, he felt a ripple in the space beside him, and he quickly turned his head to look.

A figure appeared, and Han Li saw that it was Bai Ze and Yue Mian.

"Congratulations, Han Li, your physical cultivation has made great progress, and you're almost at the peak of perfection," Bai Ze said with a smile, his eyes shining brightly.

Yue Mian also turned to look at Han Li, his eyes burning with interest.

Han Li felt uncomfortable under Yue Mian's gaze, and he sensed the other's aura. His eyes widened in shock.

Yue Mian's aura was as deep as the ocean, and Han Li couldn't feel its boundaries. It was not inferior to Bai Ze's.

"Could it be that he's also a Dao Ancestor? I remember that the summoning array of the Lei Peng clan was extremely powerful. Could he be the true spirit king of the You Tian Kun Peng?"

Han Li's mind racing with thoughts, but he quickly composed himself, bowed to Bai Ze, and said, "Thank you, Senior Bai Ze, for your guidance. Otherwise, I wouldn't have reached my current cultivation level."

"It's just a small matter, Han Li, don't mention it," Bai Ze replied with a smile.

"It may be a small matter to you, Senior, but to me, it's a great kindness. If you have any orders in the future, please don't hesitate to tell me," Han Li said seriously.

Bai Ze had allowed him to enter the Blood Gate of the Asura, and his physical cultivation had reached its current level. The favor was not inferior to the guidance of the old Dao Ancestor.

"Ah, since you're so willing, I'll make a request. If the Barbarian Domain encounters any difficulties in the future, I hope you can help us in any way you can," Bai Ze said with a smile.

Han Li was taken aback. Bai Ze was putting too much trust in him. The Barbarian Domain had two true spirit kings, and people like Liu Le'er and Xiao Bai had inherited the true spirit king's bloodline. Their future prospects were limitless, and they were accompanied by powerful figures like Liu Qing.

With the Barbarian Domain's strength, if they still encountered difficulties, their enemies would be incredibly powerful. What could he do to help?

"If that day comes, although I may not be able to help much, I'll still do my best to assist," Han Li said after a moment of silence.

Bai Ze nodded, turned to Yue Mian, and introduced him to Han Li. "I've been too busy talking. Han Li, let me introduce you to Yue Mian, the other true spirit king of the Barbarian Domain. He's very interested in you."

"I'm Han Li, nice to meet you, Senior Yue Mian," Han Li said, bowing to Yue Mian.

Others had also noticed Yue Mian's presence, but they hadn't seen him before. When they heard Bai Ze's introduction, they came forward to pay their respects.

"Enough, I'm not Bai Ze, I don't like these empty rituals," Yue Mian said, waving his hand. "Young man, where did you learn the technique of refining the bloodline from?"

Han Li felt a surge of weakness, as if he couldn't control himself, and he replied, "I learned it from the relics of a Kun Peng elder in the lower realm."

Yue Mian's expression changed, and he looked at Han Li in surprise. "A technique from the lower realm?"

Han Li's weakness dissipated, and he regained control of his body. He felt a mix of shock and helplessness.

He realized that, despite his recent progress, he was still no match for a Dao Ancestor. He was at their mercy.

But Han Li thought of Liu Tianhao, who was at the peak of the Da Luo realm. He had been no match for Bai Ze, and Han Li's current strength was nothing compared to that.

Han Li's anger and resentment dissipated, and he smiled. "No need to worry, Senior Yue Mian. You're a straightforward person, and you only asked me a question. I wouldn't hold any grudges."

Bai Ze frowned and said, "Yue Mian, you can't just control people like that. It's impolite. Our Barbarian Domain is often criticized for being too rash and impulsive."

Yue Mian looked at Han Li, his brow furrowed, and seemed to want to say something but stopped.

"It's no problem, Senior Yue Mian. You're a straightforward person, and you only asked me a question. I wouldn't hold any grudges," Han Li said with a smile.

Yue Mian smiled and said, "I see you're a sensible person. I like that."

Bai Ze shook his head and didn't say anything else.
Han Li, you possess the Kunpeng bloodline and have considerable strength, and your personality is quite to my liking. Are you interested in becoming my Dao Ancestor's messenger? Yue Man turned around and smiled at Han Li.

"Dao Ancestor's messenger?" Han Li was taken aback, as this was the first time he had heard of such a term.

The people around them heard this and immediately became restless, with most of them looking confused, just like Han Li. However, a few individuals, such as Liu Qing, Qing Dian, and the young master of the Zouwu clan, changed their expressions, looking at Han Li with envy and jealousy.

Noticing the gazes of the people around him, Han Li's eyes flickered.

"Han Daoist, you are currently not at the Great Luo realm, so you don't know much about the Dao Ancestor. My father, Yue Man, and other Dao Ancestors usually stay in seclusion and rarely show themselves. This time, if the Heavenly Court hadn't been pressuring us, my father wouldn't have come out. Therefore, the Dao Ancestors will choose individuals with exceptional talent and strength to become their messengers, conveying their will and handling some matters. Becoming a Dao Ancestor's messenger has immense benefits. Firstly, your status will immediately increase, and you will have a powerful backer, making it unlikely for anyone to dare provoke you. Secondly, in terms of cultivation, the Dao Ancestor will bestow you with powerful magical artifacts, teach you great divine abilities, or guide your cultivation. In short, the benefits are countless. It's fortunate that Yue Man has taken a liking to you, this is a rare opportunity that you shouldn't miss!" Lichi's voice echoed in Han Li's mind.

Han Li heard these words and his expression changed several times, but he didn't immediately agree. Instead, he looked thoughtful.

Bai Ze saw this and simply smiled, while Yue Man didn't urge him to respond.

"Thank you, Yue Man, for your kindness. However, I have many personal matters to attend to, and I don't have enough time to deal with them. I can only decline your offer." Han Li didn't consider it for long and quickly bowed slightly.

He had too many secrets, and it wasn't suitable for him to get close to powerful individuals, let alone stay by the side of a Dao Ancestor.

Moreover, he didn't understand Yue Man, and it was even more unlikely that he would follow him.

The people around them saw this and looked shocked, with Liu Qing and others staring at Han Li in disbelief.

"This Han Li is crazy, he doesn't even want to become a Dao Ancestor's messenger." Qing Dian saw Han Li's refusal and was surprised, but also secretly delighted.

"Fool." The young master of the Zouwu clan sneered in his heart.

Yue Man saw Han Li refuse him and his gaze flashed, but he didn't get angry. He simply nodded and turned to look elsewhere, no longer paying attention to Han Li.

Han Li saw this and felt a sense of relief in his heart, his tense nerves relaxing.

Bai Ze looked at Han Li deeply and then turned to the others, saying, "The Blood Sacrifice Conference has come to an end. You all should return to your respective clan areas. The True Immortal Realm is about to experience turmoil, and you should all accumulate your strength to prepare for the future changes."

"Yes!" The people present responded in unison and then bid farewell.

Qing Dian and the young master of the Zouwu clan glanced at Han Li coldly before leaving.

Han Li noticed their gazes and frowned.

These two seemed to have a deep grudge against him. Their current strength didn't bother him, but they had inherited the True Spirit King's bloodline and would likely become much stronger in the future, possibly even becoming Dao Ancestors.

According to his usual way of handling things, he should eliminate such enemies early on. However, with Bai Ze and Yue Man present, he didn't dare make a move.

"Brother, I just inherited the Sacred Ancestor's bloodline, and although I've been cultivating in the Asura Blood Gate for a hundred years, I still haven't fully merged with my body. I need to return to the Tianhu clan to continue my cultivation. Brother, you don't seem like you'll be staying in the Barbarian Realm for long. You must come back and visit me in the future." Just then, Liu Le'er flew to Han Li's side, her eyes misty with tears.

"I will definitely come back." Han Li patted Liu Le'er's head and smiled.

Liu Le'er's face immediately lit up with a smile, and she nodded vigorously before returning to the Tianhu clan.

Liu Qing, Huo San, and the others also bid farewell to Han Li before the Tianhu clan departed, flying away into the distance. In the blink of an eye, only Han Li, Xiao Bai, Bai Ze, Yue Man, and Lichi remained on the square.

"Bai Ze, Yue Man, thank you for your hospitality. However, I have some matters to attend to, so I'll take my leave." Han Li stepped forward and bowed to Bai Ze and Yue Man before departing.

He had been delayed in the Barbarian Realm for over a hundred years and didn't know what had happened to the Golden Boy. He needed to leave the Barbarian Realm and investigate the situation.

"Since you have matters to attend to, I won't keep you." Bai Ze nodded slightly.

"Xiao Bai, you've just broken through to the Great Luo realm, and your bloodline's power is still unstable. You should stay in the Bayan Mountain to cultivate." Bai Ze turned to Xiao Bai and said.

"Thank you, Your Majesty, for your concern. However, I want to follow my master." Xiao Bai shook his head.

Bai Ze's expression turned stern upon hearing this.

"Xiao Bai, you've inherited the Muye Qiong's True Spirit bloodline, and your status is noble. You don't need to call me 'master' anymore, just call me 'Dao friend'." Han Li glanced at Bai Ze and quickly said.

Xiao Bai could call him whatever he wanted in private, but in front of Bai Ze and Yue Man, he didn't want to offend them.

"It doesn't matter if it's 'master' or 'Dao friend,' I'm used to calling you 'master'." Xiao Bai waved his hand and said.

(To all the Dao friends, I have something to attend to, so I'll only be posting one chapter today.
