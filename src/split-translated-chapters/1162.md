Yuansan looked at the five golden pellets with increasing excitement in his eyes.

"Ah, Dragon Five's alchemy skills are truly impressive, to have refined five Time Pills in just five or six years. I'm impressed," Yuansan said with a bow.

"Yuansan, you said you wanted to complete this within ten years, so I naturally had to rush a bit. With a bit of luck, I was able to barely meet your requirements. Please take a look at these pills and see if they're acceptable," Han Li said with a smile, placing the five Time Pills and the box into the transmission array and activating it.

The pills and box disappeared and reappeared in front of Yuansan.

Yuansan didn't hesitate, taking out each of the five pills and carefully examining them.

"All five pills are fine, and they're all third-grade Time Pills, which is even better than I expected. I don't like to take advantage of people, so aside from the Water Source King Crystal we agreed on, I'll give you an additional 1 million Spirit Stones as a token of appreciation," Yuansan said with a nod.

"No need for the extra reward, Yuansan. You don't take advantage of people, and neither do I. Since we agreed on five Time Pills for the Water Source King Crystal, just give me the crystal," Han Li said with a faint smile.

Yuansan heard this and fell silent for a moment, but his eyes lit up slightly as he looked at Han Li.

"I didn't expect Dragon Five to be a man of his word. Very well, let's become friends today. Although I may not have Dragon Five's alchemy skills, I have some connections and methods, especially when it comes to collecting rare materials. I'm not a useless person," Yuansan said with a sudden laugh.

"Of course, I'm delighted," Han Li said with a smile, his eyes gleaming with interest.

Although he didn't know much about Yuansan, the fact that he could produce the Water Source King Crystal and had enough materials for him to refine the Time Pills meant that he must have some connections in collecting Time Law materials.

Han Li's goal in refusing the 1 million Spirit Stones was to get closer to Yuansan and gather more information about other Time Law materials. He wouldn't refuse further communication with Yuansan.

From what he could see, Yuansan was similar to him in some ways.

"I've obtained the five pills, so I need to attend to some matters. I won't chat with Dragon Five for long today, but if you're ever in Jiuyuan City, please don't hesitate to contact me. We can have a good drink and conversation," Yuansan said.

"Jiuyuan City!" Han Li's eyebrows twitched at the mention of the city.

He had heard of it before, a massive city near the Jiuyuan Sect's mountain gate, and one of the largest cities in the Dajin Yuan Immortal Domain. Could it be that Yuansan was a member of the Jiuyuan Sect?

Han Li's thoughts were racing, but he nodded in agreement.

Yuansan immediately took out the Water Source King Crystal and used the transmission array to send it to Han Li.

The two of them were eager to handle their respective items, and they quickly ended the transmission.

Han Li closed the transaction interface, looking at the Water Source King Crystal in his hand. He couldn't help but smile as he activated the "Grand Five Elements Illusory World Technique", condensing a golden ring that surrounded the crystal.

With a "crack", the crystal shattered, releasing numerous water droplet-shaped golden light points that flew into the golden ring and merged with it. The light points then transformed into 41 golden threads that wrapped around the Time Vessel.

Han Li's internal Time Law energy surged, almost returning to its previous peak.

Han Li closed his eyes, circulating the "Grand Five Elements Illusory World Technique" as the five Time Law items rotated around him. They moved more smoothly than before, and his heart felt a surge of joy.

He shook his head, putting away the technique, and took out the Heaven-Piercing Sword Array diagram to continue studying its mysteries. He didn't stop for a moment.

The mysterious situation in the Eight Wastes Mountain range was still unknown to him, and he needed to increase his strength as quickly as possible.

The Heaven-Piercing Sword diagram floated above Han Li's head, emitting a soft glow that enveloped his body.

Threads of mysterious sword array changes flowed from the diagram, and Han Li's understanding of the Heaven-Piercing Sword Array deepened rapidly.

Time passed quickly, and several years went by in the blink of an eye. The Eight Wastes Mountain range finally came into view.

...

The vast expanse of the Savage Wilderness was impossible to calculate, but it was divided into irregular regions due to the presence of various immortal domains. The Eight Wastes Mountain range was a particularly special location.

It was said that the mountain range was the origin of the Savage Wilderness's mountains and rivers, with nearly half of the mountain ranges and rivers originating from it.

Therefore, it was said that the Eight Wastes Mountain range was the source of the Savage Wilderness's mountains and rivers, and it wasn't an exaggeration.

It was also said that when the eight True Spirits attempted to end the Savage Wilderness's chaotic era, the Eight Wastes Mountain range became the location of their alliance and oath, and it became the sacred mountain of the entire Savage Wilderness.

At the peak of the Eight Wastes Mountain range stood a black stone structure, a circular great hall.

The great hall was surrounded by a closed-off area, with only a single dark red fire pit in the center, where a cluster of golden flames burned steadily. The flames weren't too intense, casting a faint glow over the surroundings.
The grand hall was surrounded by four walls, with eight stone chairs arranged in a simple and unadorned style, resembling those found in a common village. Each chair had a rough, unpolished texture.

Behind each chair stood a stone statue, over a zhang tall, with most of them depicting fierce beasts. However, one statue stood out from the rest.

It was a majestic lion with a snow-white body, its mane fluffy, and a pair of horns on its head. A beard hung from its chin, and its face appeared kind and gentle. A long, thick tail swished behind it, resembling a cloud of white mist.

Unlike the other statues, this one had a person sitting in front of it. The man wore a snow-white long robe, with a face as smooth as jade and eyebrows that shone like stars. His eyes were deep and mysterious, with a faint golden glow surrounding his pupils, like the moon reflected in a lake.

However, his head was adorned with two curved horns, and a small tuft of goat-like beard hung from his chin. This added a touch of vitality to his otherwise serene and dignified appearance.

At this moment, the man held a scroll made of green jade, but he didn't look at it. Instead, his gaze fell upon the fire pit in the center of the hall, his eyes flickering with a hint of unease.

After a moment, he withdrew his gaze, and his face took on a more melancholic expression.

It was in this very hall that he, along with other true spirit kings, had formed an alliance and ended the era of chaos in the primordial realm. However, now, among the eight true spirit kings, only he remained.

He was the wisest of them all, the White Beast Bai Ze.

Legend had it that he had been the one to bring the eight kings together and forge the alliance.

Later, it was he and the ink-eyed Pixiu who had revised the primordial law, establishing a set of basic etiquette for the entire primordial realm. This had finally brought an end to the era of chaos and strife.

"Back then, I had to endure so much disdain to bring you all together. Now, you've all scattered, and I'm left to deal with the mess. Why should I be the one to clean up after you?" Bai Ze's eyes swept over the empty chairs, and he couldn't help but complain.

After his outburst, he chuckled wryly and continued to gaze at the flames. "These years, the primordial fire has grown weaker, and the entire realm is on the brink of chaos. The great tide of fate is sweeping us up, and we cannot escape. The gates of the Asura Bloodline will be opened, and you will not be able to avoid it..."

As he spoke, Bai Ze's expression seemed to brighten, and he stroked his goat-like beard, a smile spreading across his face.

The grand hall began to echo with his voice: "The great wind rises, the clouds soar..."

...

Below the Eight Wastes Mountain, a black stone city stood tall.

The city was over a hundred zhang tall, with a bustling crowd at the entrance. Caravans loaded with exotic beasts and goods flowed in, one after another.

A small, unassuming caravan was nestled among the larger groups, drawing attention to itself.

At the front of the caravan, a tall, silver-horned man with a worried expression walked back, his face a picture of concern. This was Sang Tu.

"Stone Elder, we're approaching the Town of the Primordial Realm. The guards at the entrance are strict, and with our tribes' identities... we might not be allowed in. It would be best if you could intervene," Sang Tu said, rubbing his hands together.

 Inside the carriage, Han Li sat quietly, his aura hidden. Unless a powerful demon attacked the silver-horned and cloud-patterned tiger tribes, he would not intervene. Otherwise, he remained hidden, not revealing his presence.

This had earned him the respect and fear of the two tribes. In the realm of the immortals, strength was revered, and the primordial realm was no exception.

Sang Tu and Yun Bao's abilities were not enough to discern the unusual aura of Han Li's true spirit bloodline. However, if they encountered someone stronger than Han Li, it would be difficult to conceal his true identity.

If Han Li's human identity was discovered, it would invite unnecessary trouble.

He had come to this place for a purpose, not to seek trouble.

"No need to worry, just accept the inspection, and everything will be fine," Han Li said calmly.

Sang Tu's heart eased significantly at Han Li's words. Over the years, he and Yun Bao had witnessed Han Li's abilities and had grown to trust him.

He glanced at Yun Bao, who nodded and continued to drive the carriage forward.

As they approached the entrance, two guards with eagle-like heads and sharp eyes blocked their path. "Halt, which tribe are you from?" one of them asked, eyeing the caravan.
