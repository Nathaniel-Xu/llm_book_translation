"Think you can escape?" 

Shixin sneered coldly, his ten fingers moving swiftly. 

The Golden Winged Hawk unfolded its wings, transforming into a golden light as it pursued E Modi and Liu Huafuren, its speed astonishing, almost disappearing in the blink of an eye. It swiftly closed in, its two massive claws snapping downwards towards the two.

At this very moment, Liu Huafuren suddenly swept her sleeve to the side. 

A dark light shot out from the sleeve, striking the Golden Winged Hawk head-on with a speed faster than lightning.

The dark light was actually a dense concentration of minute, countless particles, radiating a faint, eerie fluctuation.

"Taiyin yuan magnetic polar light! Where did you obtain such a thing?" Shixin exclaimed in shock, leaping backward, his hands grasping the emptiness as he forcefully yanked to the side.

The Golden Winged Hawk's body suddenly shifted to the side, narrowly avoiding the dark light. 

However, with the two sides being too close and the speed too fast, the Golden Winged Hawk failed to dodge in time and was struck by the dark light.

A "Bong" echoed through the air as the dark light burst and shook open, transforming into black, ripple-like lights that clung to the Golden Winged Hawk, spreading rapidly.

The Golden Winged Hawk's lively movements suddenly stiffened, the strange grating sounds echoed from within its body as if the internal mechanisms had suffered immense blockage, unable to move despite Shixin's frantic control.

Meanwhile, Liu Huafuren and E Modi seized the opportunity to make a slight detour, narrowly avoiding the Golden Winged Hawk's strike.

The Golden Winged Hawk continued flying forward with immense speed, as though it were a bowstring bursting with unbridled energy, only to violently crash into the ground.

A massive "Boom" shook the air, causing a giant, deep crater to be excavated into the ground. Sand and dust scattered through the air.

Shixin didn't manage to avoid the impact, being dragged into the crater alongside the Golden Winged Hawk.

Liu Huafuren and E Modi, unfazed, continued flying swiftly onward. 

When passing by a hidden area, E Modi's figure flickered momentarily before he plunged into the shadows.

A piercing cry ensued, swiftly cut short by an eerie silence.

E Modi emerged from the hidden area once more, but his hand grasped something - a person.

Han Li, within the blood array, directed his gaze toward the man E Modi was holding captive. The man turned out to be Shi Chongkong.

Shi's body had faint traces of blood, his eyes sealed tightly shut. His breath remained steady, suggesting that he was merely rendered unconscious.

Han Li's expression wavered at the sight of his friend.

"What's going on?" Han Li wondered, feeling perplexed. Why did E Modi bother capturing Shi Chongkong when the team was being pursued by their enemies and was desperately in need of escaping?

Without hesitation, E Modi's figure continued speeding onward like lightning until he arrived at the fractured wall.

His fist was adorned with strong white starlight, and a wave of raw energy quivered from his hand. "Sss," he growled before punching the wall, where a blast of white light solidified and smote it.

A deafening "Boom" thundered through the air.

The entire building shook violently, the wall cracked to produce a massive opening over a man's height.

Sha Xin suddenly emerged from the crater.

"You won't escape!" she exclaimed upon witnessing E Modi's escape, her expression anxious.

As she dashed forward at breathtaking speed, a burst of glowing energy radiated from her hands.

"Tck-tck!" A sharp sound echoed.

Sha Xin hurtled two silver orbs from her sleeves; these orbs separated in a split second to transform into two silver, giant birds whose momentum escalated after spreading their wings, accelerating faster than a silver streak toward E Modi and Liu Huafuren.

During their high-speed pursuit, their massive bodies erupted to unleash innumerable sharp silver needles at E Modi and Liu Huafuren.

Just before these needles would have reached their targets, E Modi hastily grasped Liu Huafuren's arm and dashed out of the opening. Their shadows quickly vanished into thin air.

Innumerable needles rained down upon the wall, leaving minute pockmarks across its surface.

While the two silver giant birds resembled the Golden Winged Hawk in shape, their imposing auras felt much weaker.

The pockmarks left on the walls were shallow and couldn't compare to the Golden Winged Hawk's intimidating, razor-sharp feathers.

However, the silver birds' speed matched their agility. Like flashes of lightning, they swiftly reduced their velocity to an abrupt halt.

A series of powerful booms shook the walls.

Although the building trembled, the giant birds repeatedly smashed into the opening without creating an escape path.

Finally, Sha Xin arrived before the heavily battered walls.

A faint, stony mask obscured her expression. She speedily danced her hands to and fro and clapped together, causing the two giant birds to shrink into glowing orbs once again.

Sha Xin caught these orbs in her hands, their clinking sounds muffled as they retreated back into her control.
The chapter begins with Sha Xin turning to look at Zhuo Ge and issuing a cold order, "Xiao Zi and Kun Yu will go with me to chase after E Xi. Zhuo Ge, I'll leave this place to you, and temporarily, the control of the Golden Winged Goshawk is in your hands. Kill all of the remaining masters here."

Around the same time, Fu Jian was still trapped in the blood-colored cocoon, quietly and motionlessly hiding his presence as his energy weakened. Qin Yuan had been killed by a lightning strike, and Chen Yang had already defected to Gui City.

In the city, the remaining four masters were Han Li, Sun Tu, Duan Tong, Zhu Ziyuan, and Zhu Ziqing.

When they heard Sha Xin's words, the faces of Duan Tong, Zhu Ziyuan, and Zhu Ziqing instantly changed colors as they considered escaping. However, they dared not to move recklessly due to Sha Xin's intimidating aura.

Sun Tu on the other hand, was activating a mysterious technique that caused black lights to flash around his body, allowing him to swiftly get up.

Han Li whispered to himself, "Xiao Zi..."

Zhuo Ge indifferently cupped his hands and replied, "Yes, sir."

The black-clothed woman and the large brute of a man responded before immediately taking their positions on either side of Sha Xin's back, flanking him.

As Han Li observed Xiao Zi, Sha Xin turned around and cast a glance at Han Li, his brow furrowed slightly in suspicion. Though he was unclear about what was happening, Sha Xin chose not to investigate further and turned his attention to departing.

In Sha Xin's wake, Xiao Zi and the large man followed him out of the giant cave and disappeared into the distance.

Without any hesitation, Zhuo Ge made a hand gesture and sent six men, including Wu Yun, two bald men, Chen Yang, and Xuan Yuan, charging forward. The men promptly surrounded Sun Tu, Zhu Ziyuan, and Zhu Ziqing.

Han Li, trapped in the blood array, remained calm as his eyes followed Xiao Zi's disappearing figure. His face darkened into a scowl as his teeth clenched in anguish, he soon returned to normal and began to stimulate the blood array once more.

He chose to seal about half of the massive spiritual energy within the array and integrate it into his own body, speeding up the growth process of his "Heavenly Extinction Imprisonment Technique."

The array was now filled with a brilliant, blood-red glow. As a result of the colossal spiritual energy from the array, Han Li's body was now illuminating with a faint, blood-like radiance. Moreover, this led to a forceful breakthrough, and several of his acupuncture points were opened consecutively, accompanied by successive muffled booms.

As the blood array experienced this acute change in energy, the surrounding area, initially tranquil, was now engulfed in surging spiritual energy. Consequently, Zhuo Ge and the other members of his party couldn't help but feel an intense, impending sense of foreboding.

During the brief moment of everyone's distraction, two figures emerged from Gui City's encirclement and sprinted towards the cave entrance. These were none other than Sun Tu and Duan Tong.

Zhu Ziyuan and Zhu Ziqing saw their chance as well, swiftly transforming into silhouettes and dodging their pursuers as they escaped towards a different direction.

Zhuo Ge let out a quiet curse, feeling his momentary lapse in vigilance. He quickly dispatched Wu Yun and another bald-headed man to pursue Zhu Ziyuan and Zhu Ziqing.

"Morning Sun, Xuan Yuan, Han Li and the remaining person in the blood array are left to you."

Just as Chen Yang and Xuan Yuan went to the blood array, they heard a cold, suppressed chuckle and suddenly felt an intense pain reminiscent of a hot blade piercing their souls.

A flash of white light escaped the blood array, where they saw some chains being flung out, and an instant later, these chains disappeared into their brains.

The movement happened swiftly, akin to lightning flashing before one's eyes. Chen Yang and Xuan Yuan, being instantaneously petrified, now had empty, spaced-out expressions as they stood still.

Zhuo Ge remained oblivious to this, a considerable distance away, and his perception of the situation led him to believe Chen Yang and the others were closely examining the blood array.

"Fellow acquaintances, I'll spare your lives this one time. Let's hope you won't bother me in the future," Han Li said indistinctly from within the blood array.

As the last of his words faded away, he resumed his fervent stimulation of the blood array and his unwavering, unrelenting assault on the acupuncture points.

Meanwhile, Sun Tu and Duan Tong had fled but were soon intercepted by Zhuo Ge and his companion on the road. As the two tried to get past them, a loud boom echoed through the air.

Suddenly, a gigantic white wolf and an equally enormous silver leopard descended from above, landing before the duo and cutting off their path.

Both of these enormous magical creatures towered over ten meters high, casting long shadows that engulfed Sun Tu and Duan Tong. Their faces were twisted with unsightly expressions as a hint of desperation began to emerge in their eyes.

"I'm sorry, my two acquaintances. Although I don't hold a grudge against you, Han Li's order states that I need to take your lives, so I have no choice but to make an exception," Zhuo Ge explained.

"No, a better reason would be that we have no personal connection with you, so there's no harm in offending you."

Upon speaking, Zhuo Ge wiggled his fingers. At his fingertips, a group of gemstone strings began to sparkle.

Just as he did so, the enormous wolf beast let out a thunderous roar, exposing rows of sharp teeth and hurtling towards Sun Tu and Duan Tong.
