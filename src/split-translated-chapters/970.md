As they spoke, Hei Da raised his hands, and the silver leopard puppet beneath him displayed a series of silver patterns on its body, radiating light and gathering energy.

"This light shield is extremely sturdy, and our two puppets aren't enough to break it," Zuogou said calmly, raising his hand to stop Hei Da and speaking in a flat tone.

"What should we do?" Hei Da asked, his eyes widening in surprise.

"Don't worry, our puppets may not be able to break this seal, but that doesn't mean others can't. Now I finally understand why the city lord left the Golden Winged Hawk puppet here," Zuogou said, turning around to look at the Golden Winged Hawk puppet on the ground, a smile spreading across his face.

Just as he was about to turn around, a cold hum sounded in his ear, and a strand of invisible spiritual energy pierced into Zuogou's mind.

Zuogou let out a mournful grunt, suddenly clutching his head with both hands.

At that moment, a crystalline light shot out of the Blood Array like a bolt of lightning, arriving instantly before Zuogou.

Inside the crystalline light, several crystal clear locks could be seen, about to penetrate Zuogou's brain.

Just in time, dozens of nearly transparent crystalline threads burst forth from Zuogou's brow, wrapping around the crystalline light and the crystal clear locks.

The crystal clear locks seemed like fish trapped in a net, halted mid-air by the crystalline threads.

However, the locks were much thicker and longer than the threads, struggling and twisting to continue their advance.

But this brief moment of hesitation was enough for Zuogou to react, leaping off the White Wolf puppet and rapidly flying towards the distance, his voice cold and mocking: "It seems that Your Excellency has little experience fighting against people from the Puppet City. This level of spiritual attack is ineffective against us."

Hei Da immediately followed suit, driving his puppet to chase after Zuogou.

Inside the Blood Array, Han Li's hands formed a seal, and a crystalline light flashed at his brow.

The crystal clear locks immediately intensified their radiance, breaking free from the crystalline threads and shooting back, but they did not pursue Zuogou and Hei Da.

Han Li took a deep breath, operating the Blood Array with all his might, continuously bombarding the mystical orifices on his body.

In this short period, he opened up another 20 to 30 orifices on his body.

Zuogou swiftly flew over to the Golden Winged Hawk puppet, his fingers moving rapidly as crystalline threads shot out from his hands, entering the puppet's body.

Hei Da stood before the Golden Winged Hawk puppet, wary and watching the Blood Array in the distance.

However, no further incidents occurred within the Blood Array.

The Golden Winged Hawk's body immediately radiated a bright golden light, and although the dark energy was still present, it no longer spread.

Zuogou muttered to himself, his hands forming seals as the golden light on the Golden Winged Hawk's body began to churn and surge, enshrouding the dark energy and counterattacking.

The dark energy slowly began to dissipate, but at a very slow pace.

Zuogou's eyes flashed with impatience, and he raised his hand, summoning the black bone sword that had once belonged to Sun Tu. With a swift slash, the sword dispersed a wave of dark energy.

The silhouette of the Lynx Beast reappeared, but its color was much duller than before, and it seemed lazy and unwilling to move.

Zuogou let out a soft snort, his hand grasping the sword as white light flashed, accompanied by several crystalline threads.

The Lynx Beast's silhouette finally stirred, opening its mouth to suck in the dark energy on the Golden Winged Hawk.

The dark energy rapidly detached from the Golden Winged Hawk puppet, forming a hazy column of black light that entered the Lynx Beast's mouth.

The Golden Winged Hawk's golden light drove away the dark energy, and the Lynx Beast's consumption caused the dark energy to rapidly dissipate, disappearing entirely after a few breaths.

The Golden Winged Hawk puppet let out a joyful cry, spreading its wings and taking to the air, transformed into a golden phantom that whirled and spun within the grand hall at an incredible speed, leaving behind over a dozen afterimages.

The golden phantom generated powerful gusts of wind that howled through the hall, leaving behind marks on the floor and walls.

Wu Yun and Zhu Ziyuan were affected by the gusts and immediately retreated to avoid the winds, ceasing their battle.

Zhu Ziyuan looked up at the whirling golden phantom, a hint of fear crossing his face.

Zhu Qing, however, gazed at the phantom, but her eyes were not focused on the Golden Winged Hawk; instead, they reflected Zuogou's figure, a complex glow flashing in her eyes.

Although the golden phantom moved with incredible speed, it seemed slightly unsteady, likely due to Zuogou's unfamiliarity with controlling the puppet.

However, after circling the grand hall twice, the Golden Winged Hawk puppet quickly stabilized.

"The Golden Winged Hawk, renowned for its speed within the Puppet City, truly lives up to its reputation," Zuogou thought, his heart burning with excitement, before turning to gaze at the Blood Array, his eyes flashing with a fierce light, his fingers moving in a blur.

The Golden Winged Hawk let out a sharp cry, its wings beating rapidly as it transformed into a golden afterimage, shooting towards the Blood Array like lightning.

Approaching the Blood Array, the Golden Winged Hawk suddenly retracted its wings, its body resembling a massive golden cone, with its sharp beak at the tip.

The golden beak radiated an unstoppable golden light, imbued with the force to pierce through anything, as it stabbed towards the Blood Array's light shield.

Within the Blood Array, Han Li's brow furrowed, his hands forming a seal as he countered with a swift motion.

A crystalline sword shadow shot out from his brow, radiating a fierce aura, which was his Divine Intent Sword.

However, he was also using his Divine Intent Cage to restrain Chenyang and the other two, exhausting a significant amount of his spiritual energy, so the Divine Intent Sword's might was somewhat diminished compared to when he had last used it.

The Divine Intent Sword shot out, but its target was not the Golden Winged Hawk puppet; instead, it was aimed directly at Zuogou.
Only the light flashed, and the sword shadow appeared in front of Zhuo Ge, flying towards his brow.

Zhuo Ge felt the aura of the Mind Sword and his face greatly changed. Without controlling the puppet, his body sprang sideways to dodge.

However, the Mind Sword suddenly changed direction, not striking Zhuo Ge, but instead cutting down the crystal threads emanating from his hands.

"Do you want to pretend one thing but mean another? laughable, do you think I wouldn't see through it?" Zhuo Ge's eyes widened as a sneer flashed on his lips, and his fingers moved, causing the crystal threads on the surface to sparkle, before turning into a misty state.

The Mind Sword didn't stop at all, slashing right through the misty crystal threads.

 With a “sizzle” sound, sparks burst out in the void, and the misty crystal threads all exploded and scattered.

 The Mind Sword also greatly diminished in radiance, seemingly having consumed a lot, and didn't continue to stay outside, flying back into the blood-colored screen.

"What?" Zhuo Ge was stunned, and an expression of utter disbelieving appeared in his eyes.

The Golden Winged Vulture puppet suddenly lost control, and its wings spread open with a loud whoosh. The direction of its flight suddenly changed, and it began flying upwards.

As a result, the area that collided with the blood-colored screen changed from the bird's beak to its abdomen.

With a loud "Boom" sound!

The blood-colored screen violently indented inwards, before undulating, with the blood light flashing wildly.

The Golden Winged Vulture puppet was bounced back by the screen, crashing into the roof.

Zhuo Ge finally recovered at this moment, and his hands moved again like wheels, sending threads flying out in all directions, darting into the Golden Winged Vulture's body like lightning.

The Golden Winged Vulture puppet glowed golden on the surface, before it was controlled by Zhuo Ge once again. The wings flapped and it barely stopped in time, just inches from crashing into the roof.

Zhuo Ge let out a long sigh, before suddenly looking at the blood formation, and his fingers moved once more, causing the Golden Winged Vulture puppet to turn around and pounce at the blood formation once more.

However, this time he didn't control the Golden Winged Vulture to attack with its beak, but instead had it spread its wings from a distance, with golden light bursting out.

With a “whoosh” sound, countless golden feathers flew out from its wings, emitting a terrifying howl, striking the blood-colored screen.

Han Li, inside the blood cocoon, frowned.

At the moment, he was inside the blood formation, with not many methods at his disposal. If Zhuo Ge was closer to the formation, he could deal with him, but since he was attacking from a distance, he had no way to counter.

Resigned, he pinched his hands together.

The blood-colored screen radiated a strong light, as countless blood-colored thread patterns burst out, and it thickened once more, rigidly resisting the Golden Winged Vulture's attack.

A deafening explosion shook the air, the blood-colored screen violently quaking, rapidly becoming thinner before the naked eye.

The Black large-eyed man at the side, witnessing this scene, urged on the Silver Leopard puppet, launching a long-range attack to aid Zhuo Ge.

The blood-colored screen grew thinner and thinner, until, a few breaths later, it finally shattered with a "Poof" sound.

The countless golden feathers didn't stop at all, continuing to fly into the blood formation.

These golden feathers possessed incredible power, only hearing the sound of tearing fabric, as the thread patterns inside the blood formation were easily cut through, destroyed like dry wood.

The remaining blood formation violently quaked, before large protrusions emerged on its surface, and then exploded with a loud "Boom".

A continuous series of thunderous explosions sounded, until the remaining blood formation had completely disappeared, transforming into a wave of blood energy, wildly surging and spreading outwards.

Zhuo Ge and the Black large-eyed man, though standing at a distance, were swiftly affected by the blood energy wave, and both they and their puppets were pushed back.

Zhuo Ge hastily moved his hands, urging the Golden Winged Vulture puppet to steady itself.

Before he could completely steady the Golden Winged Vulture, a figure burst out of the blood energy wave in front of him, bathed in a dazzling white radiance, and punched at Zhuo Ge's head.

His fist radiated immense power, tearing through the air, leaving a white mark behind, and letting out a thunderous roar.

Zhuo Ge's expression greatly changed, and he didn't bother to control the Golden Winged Vulture, his foot violently stomping on the puppet, as it rapidly shot backwards.

At the same time, a thick white light burst out of his feet, propelling him forward, greatly increasing his speed, as he barely managed to avoid that attack.

"Hmph!" that figure coldly snorted, its foot stomping on the Golden Winged Vulture puppet's back.

A muffled "Boom" sounded, as the Golden Winged Vulture puppet's enormous body crashed to the ground.

That white figure borrowed the force to shoot out, disappearing with a "Whoosh" sound, only to reappear in front of Zhuo Ge the next moment, moving at an unfathomable speed.

A terrified look flashed across Zhuo Ge's face, before he could react, his back suddenly burst out with a "Whoosh" sound, as eight black lights shot out from his spine, transforming into eight long, curved, dark legs, resembling spider legs.

Each of the eight spider legs was 2-3 meters long, with dark and sharp tips, radiating a strange glow, and sending a chill down one's spine.

With a "Whoosh" sound, the eight spider legs immediately shot towards that white figure with the speed of lightning.

Without waiting for the outcome, they struck again and again, not giving the white figure any chance to retaliate.
