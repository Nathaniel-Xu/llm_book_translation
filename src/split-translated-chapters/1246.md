“Ah……”

Qu Lian suddenly let out a sharp, ear-piercing screech, and dense, golden light dots appeared on its back.

A series of "popping" sounds echoed, and the golden light dots flashed and transformed into countless sharp, golden quills, making Qu Lian resemble a porcupine, rendering Han Li unable to attack.

All of Han Li's illusory projections vanished, leaving only one person, who made a swift grab with his hand.

A flash of golden light appeared on his palm, and nine Qing Zhu Bee Cloud swords shot out, merging into one in mid-air, transforming into a hundred-zhang-long golden giant sword, carrying a massive golden lightning bolt that heavily chopped down on Qu Lian's back.

A deafening "Boom" resounded, and a blinding flash of golden light erupted, accompanied by a series of thunderous explosions!

Qu Lian was sent flying, its golden quills shattering, and it flew towards the rear like a meteor, spewing forth blood from its mouth, its spiritual domain collapsing.

Although the golden quills shattered, Qu Lian's body had blocked the Qing Zhu Bee Cloud sword's chopping force, appearing unharmed on the surface. However, the divine thunder within the sword was not to be underestimated.

A Da Luo realm Jīn Xiān's physical body, comparable to a top-tier artifact, was nearly indestructible, but once its physical body was pierced, it lost its most prized protection.

The divine thunder's power surged into Qu Lian's body, causing chaos and turmoil within.

Qu Lian's internal injuries, previously hidden, were now triggered by the divine thunder's power, causing its spiritual energy to go haywire, and its spiritual domain to collapse.

A sense of despair arose in Qu Lian's heart, but it quickly rallied, trying to calm its internal turmoil and prepare for another counterattack.

However, just as Qu Lian was about to make its move, a golden light sphere descended from the sky, its speed too fast for Qu Lian to avoid, and it was enveloped.

Qu Lian's body was trapped within the golden light, unable to move.

Almost instantly, two long, crystalline lights shot out from within the sphere, striking Qu Lian's body.

Qu Lian's body was incredibly fragile before the crystalline lights, and it was easily sliced into three segments, golden blood splattering everywhere.

The golden light sphere began to churn and boil, as countless golden insects swarmed within, revealing that they were the manifestation of the Jīn Chóng!

Moreover, all the Jīn Chóng were physical entities, not divine manifestations!

As for Jīn Tóng, he had vanished without a trace.

Han Li witnessed this scene, and his heart stirred, a hint of thoughtfulness flickering in his eyes.

The Jīn Chóng swarmed around Qu Lian's three segments, frantically devouring them.

Qu Lian's three segments rapidly shrank, but suddenly, a flash of golden light appeared, and they exploded, disintegrating into countless Jīn Chóng, which flew in all directions.

Han Li saw this and raised his hands, the golden light within his spiritual domain swirling around his body, forming a massive golden vortex.

Han Li's spiritual domain was incredibly powerful, and the Time Law, one of the three supreme laws, surpassed all others, causing Qu Lian's Jīn Chóng to be swept into the vortex, unable to escape.

Jīn Tóng's Jīn Chóng, however, remained unaffected, continuing to fly towards Qu Lian's Jīn Chóng, biting and devouring them.

Qu Lian's Jīn Chóng, unable to flee, turned to face Jīn Tóng's Jīn Chóng, and the two groups clashed again.

The two waves of Jīn Chóng resembled two golden floods, crashing into each other, intertwining and biting, emitting a piercing, ear-piercing screech.

Han Li watched this scene, feeling an inexplicable emotion, as if he had returned to the past, when he first obtained the Jīn Chóng and discovered their mutual devouring and advancement.

Qu Lian was initially injured by Han Li, then ambushed by Jīn Tóng, suffering further injuries. Although Qu Lian's strength surpassed Jīn Tóng's, it was now at a disadvantage.

However, Qu Lian's cultivation was higher than Jīn Tóng's, and although Jīn Tóng had the upper hand, it couldn't completely defeat Qu Lian.

Han Li's thoughts were interrupted by reality, and he sighed, his hands forming a seal, his spiritual domain's golden light surging, and the Time Law's power rippling.

Qu Lian's Jīn Chóng suddenly slowed down by tenfold.

"Thanks, Uncle!" Jīn Tóng's buzzing voice came from within the swarm, and then he immediately surged forward.

With Han Li's assistance, Jīn Tóng gained a crushing advantage, and Qu Lian's Jīn Chóng rapidly dwindled, on the verge of being completely devoured.

Qu Lian's Jīn Chóng emitted a high-pitched squeal, gathering towards a single location, as if attempting to merge into one entity.

"As you said, you were originally one, and will eventually return to that state. Why struggle?" Han Li murmured to himself, waving his sleeve.

A dozen thick, golden lightning bolts shot out from his hand, striking the gathering Jīn Chóng.

A deafening thunderclap resounded, and a golden lightning bolt exploded, dispersing the Jīn Chóng.

This brief delay allowed Jīn Tóng's Jīn Chóng to surge forward, immediately overwhelming Qu Lian's Jīn Chóng.
Here is the translated text:

A moment later, the swarm of Gold Devouring Insects quieted down and gathered towards a certain location.

A flash of golden light appeared, and a slender, golden-haired girl emerged, revealing herself to be Jintong.

At this moment, she was much taller and more beautiful than before, with a more exquisite and elegant appearance. However, her expression was still cold and distant, making it difficult for others to approach her.

Jintong appeared, but did not speak. Instead, she immediately sat down in a cross-legged position, and a golden light burst forth from her body. Her skin was covered in a dense array of golden light points, numbering over 600.

Han Li saw this scene and knew that Jintong had swallowed the Qu Lian, greatly increasing her strength. She needed to cultivate and refine her energy, so he waved his hands.

A series of green flags shot out, landing around the two of them, and a multi-layered green light curtain unfolded.

Jintong's golden light churned and flowed like a tide, and the golden light points on her body increased rapidly, one by one, until they reached over 700. Her aura continued to rise.

Han Li saw this scene and was secretly delighted.

At this moment, they were in a precarious situation, and if Jintong's strength could be increased, it would be beneficial for them.

He also didn't idle around, taking out a medicinal pill and swallowing it, silently cultivating and refining his energy.

Time passed slowly, and Jintong's opened meridians increased, quickly reaching over 800. Han Li saw this and was surprised, wondering if Qu Lian's energy was so rich that it could allow Jintong to break through to the middle stage of the Daluo Realm.

Jintong's meridians flashed, reaching 839, and the churning golden light slowly calmed down, finally being absorbed into her body.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed slightly, as he felt that Jintong still had a lot of unused energy inside her. However, his eyebrows soon relaxed.

Breaking through to the middle stage of the Daluo Realm wasn't just a matter of opening meridians, but also required cutting off the evil corpse. Jintong clearly still had the ability to do so, so she chose to stop.

Jintong calmed her breath and stood up.

"Jintong, seeing that you're safe, I can finally relax." Han Li also dispelled the surrounding restrictions, looking Jintong up and down, and said.

"Uncle, it's been a long time! How did you end up here?" Jintong's beautiful eyes sparkled as she asked.

"Of course, I came to rescue you. Not just me, but also Xiaobai." Han Li said calmly, waving his hand.

A white light flashed, and Xiaobai's figure appeared, having transformed into a Pixiu shape.

"Boss, you almost got me killed!" Xiaobai appeared, immediately pouncing on Jintong, tears streaming down her face.

"Stop!" Jintong stretched out her long leg, blocking Xiaobai's head, to prevent her from getting too close.

"Uncle, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause trouble for you when I got caught by the Jiuyuan Sect." Jintong looked at Xiaobai and Han Li, her beautiful eyes flashing with a hint of emotion, and said quietly.

"We're companions, and we've been through so much together. There's no need to say any more." Han Li waved his hand, saying.

"You're right, I was being overly cautious." Jintong smiled slightly, and her beauty was like a blooming flower.

Han Li saw this scene, and his eyes lit up, secretly praising Jintong's current beauty. Among the female cultivators he knew, almost none could compare to her, and she even had a hint of rivalry with Ziling.

"Boss, you're really okay!" Xiaobai finally calmed down, rubbing her head against Jintong, and muttering.

"Jintong, according to my information, you were previously captured by the Jiuyuan Sect and imprisoned in the Ghost Valley. How did you end up here?" Han Li asked.

"Hmph! Ghost Spirit Child imprisoned me in the Feiyu Cage, planning to give me to the Heavenly Court at the Bodhi Banquet. But a few days ago, he suddenly left, and I took advantage of the opportunity to break out of the cage, escaping. However, I'm not familiar with this place, and I accidentally stumbled upon it." Jintong said, her voice filled with anger.

"I see. Although we're temporarily safe, it won't be easy to leave the Jiuyuan Sect undetected." Han Li nodded slowly, saying.

...

The Jiuyuan Palace was the core area of the Jiuyuan Sect, and the ancestral hall, which was the most important part of the sect, was located in the middle of the palace.

However, at this moment, this area was being fiercely attacked by the Wheel of Rebirth Temple.

The spatial restrictions around the Jiuyuan Palace had been lifted, and a golden light curtain enveloped the entire area. The outer perimeter was guarded by thousands of Jiuyuan Sect core elders and disciples.

It seemed that this was the main target of the Wheel of Rebirth Temple's attack, as a large number of cultivators, several times the number of Jiuyuan Sect elders and disciples, had gathered here, all wearing various masks, and fiercely attacking the Jiuyuan Palace.

At first, the Jiuyuan Palace's guardians, the elders and disciples, relied on the light curtain to engage in a fierce battle with the Wheel of Rebirth Temple's cultivators.

However, they were soon heavily injured and killed, and were forced to retreat behind the light curtain, desperately resisting while waiting for reinforcements from other parts of the sect.

But the Wheel of Rebirth Temple had clearly planned this attack for a long time, and had already made preparations to deal with the Jiuyuan Sect's cultivators. Before attacking the Jiuyuan Palace, they had already restrained a large number of Jiuyuan Sect cultivators in other areas, and had set up ambushes along the paths that the reinforcements would take.

It could be said that the Jiuyuan Palace was currently isolated and without support, and had temporarily become a desperate situation.
