Chì Mèng gazed at the golden river that suddenly appeared beneath her, a hint of surprise flashing in her eyes.

"I didn't think you'd already condensed a Creation Realm spiritual domain, but it's just a mere river, not even the purest Water Attribute Law's power. What can you do to me? Ha ha..." Chì Mèng laughed.

However, she soon couldn't laugh anymore.

The surrounding void began to transmit intense Time Law fluctuations, and a mountain range with undulating peaks and valleys emerged, covered in blue-green forest, with a golden sun-like orb suspended in the sky, and starlight twinkling around it.

"How is this possible? You're only at the early stages of the Mahāyāna Realm, how could you condense such a complete Creation Realm spiritual domain?" Chì Mèng's expression changed, her eyes filled with incredulity.

Condensing a spiritual domain was never an easy task, requiring not only immense mental energy and time, but also abundant resources and opportunities.

Ordinary people, even those who had reached the Creation Realm, could only form simple, single-domain spirits and domain spirits. Chì Mèng's own magma waterfall and flame giant were examples of this. For Hàn Lì to condense a spiritual domain with mountains, water, sun, and moon, was truly rare.

This sudden realization made Chì Mèng take Hàn Lì's strength seriously.

"Blue Color, come help," Chì Mèng thought to herself, turning to glance at Blue Color, who was still standing in place. "Don't forget what you're seeking!"

Blue Color, however, didn't immediately move, his body wavering slightly, showing hesitation.

Chì Mèng's cold voice reminded him, "Don't forget what you're seeking!"

Blue Color's eyes flashed with a hint of resignation, and he finally flew towards Chì Mèng.

Hàn Lì saw this and frowned slightly.

Just then, a sudden change occurred!

A dazzling white light flashed, and Xiao Bai felt his eyes being pierced by the intense light, momentarily blinding him.

Under the pressure of Hàn Lì's spiritual domain, Chì Mèng's slender figure suddenly flashed towards him, unrestrained.

Her hand lifted, and a semi-transparent light shield descended from above, instantly enveloping Hàn Lì and Xiao Bai.

Chì Mèng's eyes lit up, and she quickly formed a hand seal, activating the nine crimson dragon spirits on the light shield. The dragons spat out flames, engulfing the two figures within.

A pained cry echoed out.

Chì Mèng's expression changed, and she quickly stopped the light shield's power, only to see that the two black-robed figures she had brought were being enveloped by the shield, their black robes burnt and tattered.

"What's going on?" Chì Mèng asked, shocked.

Hàn Lì's voice, laced with mockery, came from a short distance away, "You've already been deceived once, how could you fall for it again?"

As soon as he finished speaking, Hàn Lì's body began to glow with a soft light, and he stepped forward, instantly appearing before Chì Mèng.

His hand held a green bamboo sword, which suddenly slashed out, its blade flashing with golden lightning and electric sparks.

Chì Mèng's eyes widened, and she barely managed to raise a hand to block the attack, but was still sent flying by Hàn Lì's sword.

Chì Mèng's body was numb, her hand burning with pain, and she tumbled through the air, finally stabilizing herself after a thousand feet.

However, before she could even catch her breath, a massive fireball descended from the sky, a deluge of fire rain pouring down towards her.

Chì Mèng's heart tightened, and she tried to move, but her ankles were bound by blue-green vines, rendering her immobile.

She attempted to cast a spell to break free, but her speed was slowed to an extreme, and she couldn't even form a seal.

In a desperate bid to escape, she let out a mighty roar, and her body was enveloped by a fierce, blazing fire.

This fire was her true fire, which responded to her spiritual domain, causing the magma waterfall to surge upwards, colliding with the fire rain.

The blue-green vines binding her ankles were also repelled by the flames.

Chì Mèng broke free, and her body soared into the air, attempting to flee from the nearby forest.

It was only then that she realized Hàn Lì's Time spiritual domain was not just a simple Creation Realm, but possessed some of the power of the Heaven and Earth Realm.

If she continued like this, she might end up in a precarious situation.

"You two, what are you waiting for? Release your spiritual domains and counteract his influence!" Chì Mèng shouted at the two black-robed figures.

The two figures exchanged a glance, and their hands moved in unison, unleashing a joint spiritual domain.

A black light emanated from their bodies, merging into a single, expansive black light screen that overlapped with Hàn Lì's spiritual domain.

The black light screen enveloped the surroundings, causing the earth to shudder, and the mountains and rivers to sink. The ground dropped by ten feet.

Hàn Lì's body also sank slightly, his figure wavering.
On the other side, Xiaobai could no longer withstand the powerful gravitational pressure and fell to the ground.

Far away, Ti Hou was engaged in a fierce battle with the Creek Tang elder, his body radiating a dark red glow, his aura extremely terrifying.

The Creek Tang elder, skilled in the art of dark soul laws, stood opposite him, his face covered in a layer of white bones, looking like an evil ghost, his black flute playing a haunting melody.

The already cracked earth began to spew forth a dark mist, and a massive city emerged from the ground.

The city was covered in thorns and spiked with human skulls, its gates bearing the ancient seal of "Fengdu" in blood-red letters, emitting a dense and intense aura of dark energy.

Creek Tang stood atop the city, his black flute playing an increasingly sharp and discordant tune.

As the melody reached its climax, the gates of Fengdu's ghost city swung open, releasing a massive wave of dark energy, and countless terrifying dark creatures poured out, rushing towards Ti Hou.

The sky was shrouded in dark clouds, and the air was filled with an icy chill, as a layer of frost formed on the ground.

Ti Hou, however, was not afraid, and instead seemed to be excited, licking his lips.

He charged forward, his body unyielding, like a warrior charging into battle, his ghostly claws swiping through the air, leaving behind a trail of black lightning-like marks, tearing through the countless dark creatures.

Ti Hou's mastery of the ghostly claws had grown, and their power had increased exponentially, leaving a trail of destruction in his wake, and the dark creatures were unable to withstand him.

The dark energy released by the creatures was absorbed by Ti Hou, and their army was unable to resist him.

Meanwhile, Qu Lin had closed in on Sword Hill, who immediately swung his sword in a wide arc, aiming for Qu Lin's neck.

Qu Lin, however, simply ducked, and opened his mouth, revealing rows of sharp teeth, and bit down on the sword.

There was a loud cracking sound as the sword shattered, and Qu Lin's teeth left a gaping hole in the blade.

"You're looking for death..." Sword Hill's face contorted in anger.

Qu Lin, however, remained calm, and took a step back, his eyes fixed on Han Li.

He seemed to be thinking, "I never thought that the person who would save me today would be him?"

Han Li, meanwhile, was engaged in a fierce battle, the two black-robed figures combining their powers to create a gravity domain, which countered Han Li's time domain, slowing him down.

Red Dream took advantage of the opportunity, and launched a new attack, her hands weaving intricate patterns, summoning a massive vortex of molten rock, which hurtled towards Han Li.

The vortex was not only incredibly hot, but also had a powerful suction force, which threatened to pull Han Li in.

Han Li, however, remained calm, and with a wave of his hand, his domain erupted, causing the earth to shudder, and a massive mountain range rose into the air, moving towards Red Dream.

The mountain range was accompanied by a wave of temporal ripples, which disrupted the vortex, and the two black-robed figures were caught off guard, their domain collapsing.

The mountain range, which was actually an illusion, did not have a physical impact, but the roots of the Eastern Divine Tree, which had taken root in the mountain, extended downwards, wrapping around the two black-robed figures, and piercing their skin.

The delicate roots injected themselves into their blood vessels, causing the two figures to cry out in agony, before falling silent.

Red Dream's face turned ugly, and she glanced over at Sword Hill and Creek Tang, who were also struggling, and shouted, "You're just a mere Great Luo initial stage, and yet you're able to make me so miserable, today I won't kill you, I'll make you suffer."

With a wave of her hand, the air around her seemed to ignite, and all the heavenly energy in the area was burned away, creating a vacuum-like effect.

Red Dream's body was surrounded by a fiery aura, her hair ablaze, her eyes blazing with golden flames, as if she was a primordial fire god, radiating an aura of terror.

She raised her hand, and a flower-like flame shot out, hurtling towards Han Li.

Han Li, however, was prepared, and with a punch, he condensed a massive fist, which clashed with the flame, producing a deafening explosion.

The explosion died down, and the flame had already burned through the fist, heading straight for Han Li.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and with a flick of his wrist, a sword appeared, and with a swift slash, the flame was dispersed.

But just as he was about to breathe a sigh of relief, a strange energy fluctuation appeared in front of him.

A massive, golden flower bloomed behind Red Dream, its petals unfolding like a peacock's tail, or the thousand hands of the Bodhisattva.
