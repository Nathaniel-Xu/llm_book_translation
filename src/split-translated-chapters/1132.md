Near the Years Tower.

After a short rest, Li Qi Ma and Qu Lin's faces relaxed a bit.

"Brother Han, you previously asked me to help you with something, and I've already assisted you. Now, you should return my Natal Essence Card, right?" Qu Lin stood up and said to Han Li.

"Of course," Han Li replied, taking out Qu Lin's Natal Essence Card and tossing it over.

"Hey, Brother Han, what about mine? According to our agreement, you should also return my Natal Essence Card, right?" Li Qi Ma saw Han Li only return Qu Lin's card and not his, and his expression turned unpleasant.

"Brother Li Qi Ma, you previously said that if I retrieved your Natal Essence Card, you would give me a reward. You wouldn't forget, would you?" Han Li took out Li Qi Ma's Natal Essence Card but didn't hand it over, instead caressing it in his hand.

"You didn't mention it, and I almost forgot. But it's good that you're straightforward, no need for beating around the bush." Li Qi Ma laughed and spat out a mouthful of air.

A white light flew out of his mouth and landed in front of him, transforming into a large white flag with wind cloud patterns etched onto it. The flag emitted an extremely powerful wind law fluctuation.

Without even activating the treasure, the air currents within several hundred miles began to churn and surge, forming a massive whirlpool.

"This Wind Flag is a magical artifact I carefully refined in the past, reaching the fifth-grade level. It can accelerate flight and has the effect of trapping people. It's one of my most precious treasures, and I'm giving it to Brother Han as a reward for retrieving my Natal Essence Card." Li Qi Ma looked at the white flag, and a hint of reluctance flashed in his eyes, but he still handed it over to Han Li.

"This flag is indeed extraordinary, but to unleash its power, one needs to have the wind law. I don't cultivate the wind law, so it's useless to me. Please take it back, Brother Li Qi Ma. As for the reward, I'd like to exchange it for something else." Han Li glanced at the white flag and sent it flying back to Li Qi Ma with a wave of his hand.

"What...what do you want from me, Brother Han?" Li Qi Ma asked, taken aback.

"I don't want any of your treasures, Brother Li Qi Ma. I just want you to agree to one condition." Han Li smiled faintly.

"What condition?" Li Qi Ma asked.

"I can see that you possess the True Spirit bloodline, belonging to the True Spirit clan. I suppose you've heard of the two True Spirits, Ba Xia and Zhu Yan?" Han Li changed to transmitting his voice.

"I know a bit about them. They're extremely rare and powerful True Spirits. What do you want to do with them, Brother Han?" Li Qi Ma asked, curious.

"I want to ask you to help me find a vial of their True Spirit essence blood. That will be the reward I seek." Han Li said.

He had already obtained ten types of True Spirit bloodlines, and he was missing the last two, which were Ba Xia and Zhu Yan. However, he was being pursued by the Heavenly Court and didn't have much time to search for them. Li Qi Ma, with his True Spirit bloodline, would be more suitable for the task.

"Brother Han, you make it sound easy, but these two True Spirits are almost extinct in the True Immortal Realm. Where would I even find them? And even if I do, it won't be easy to obtain their blood essence. Moreover, Ba Xia and Zhu Yan are extremely powerful True Spirits; it's not easy to extract their blood essence." Li Qi Ma transmitted his voice.

"I know it's not easy to find these two True Spirit bloodlines, but I'm counting on you to try your best. If you encounter any difficulties, feel free to contact me for help." Han Li took out a transmission array plate and handed it to Li Qi Ma along with his Natal Essence Card.

Li Qi Ma's eyes flickered as he accepted the transmission array plate and Natal Essence Card.

"You're giving me your Natal Essence Card just like that? Aren't you afraid I'll take it and run?" He raised an eyebrow.

"I trust my judgment of people, and I can see that you're not someone who would go back on your word." Han Li smiled faintly.

Besides, finding the remaining two True Spirit essence bloodlines wasn't a matter of great importance. If Li Qi Ma didn't fulfill his promise, Han Li could always put up a reward in the Wheel of Reincarnation and search for them himself.

"Brother Han, you trust me so much, and I appreciate that. Alright, I'll try my best to find them." Li Qi Ma's eyes gleamed with determination as he stored the transmission array plate, Natal Essence Card, and Wind Flag.

As Jiao San watched Han Li and Li Qi Ma converse, her eyes sparkled, but she didn't ask any questions.

Just then, a loud explosion shook the air, and the nearby void shattered once more!

Two figures flew out of the void, and it was Liu Zi and Huo San.

They had both suffered different degrees of injury, but they seemed to be fine. Seeing Han Li and the others, they flew over immediately.

"Brother Liu, you're safe!" Jiao San exclaimed.

But before she could finish speaking, another sudden change occurred!

A loud rumbling sound came from the front, and the sixth layer of the Years Tower suddenly collapsed, releasing a massive space storm that swept Han Li and the others away.

The space storm was accompanied by spatial rifts that cut through the air, and the group hastily retreated to avoid them. However, the spatial rifts were too numerous and too sudden, and Huo San was caught off guard, his right arm sliced off by a rift. His arm exploded into a shower of blood.

The others quickly increased their speed to escape, and even Lanyan, who was cultivating in the nearby valley, was startled and flew over to join the group in their retreat.
No one else seemed surprised by the appearance of Blue Color.

Fortunately, the spatial storm didn't spread too far and began to converge, and no one else was injured.

Before anyone could say anything, a loud explosion echoed from the Time Tower once again, and the fifth layer also burst open.

Then came the fourth layer, the third layer, the second layer, and even the first layer, all bursting open in succession...

The entire Time Tower disappeared without a trace, leaving behind only a spatial storm that wildly cut and devoured everything around it.

This spatial storm contained an extremely terrifying power, with an extraordinary strong spatial force surging within it, far surpassing the void turbulence Han Li had experienced before.

Han Li even felt that even if he still had his time law power and his spiritual power was at its peak, being swept up in this spatial storm would be a fatal outcome.

The entire space here was also shaken by this terrifying spatial storm, violently shaking, and the ground was trembling.

"What a terrifying spatial force, fortunately we escaped in time, otherwise we would have really died without a burial place." Qu Lin said with a lingering fear.

His physical body was incredibly strong, but he felt he couldn't resist the power of this spatial storm.

"The Time Tower's various layers have opened up independent spaces, and the entire Time Tower can be considered a spatial artifact, and a high-grade one at that. This self-destruction is naturally not trivial." Liu Zai said.

"Shi Dao friend is still inside, he was trapped by the residual soul of Wen Tai Sui's Heavenly Man Realm spirit domain and self-destructed. Now he's been swept up in this terrifying spatial storm, and it's likely that he's in grave danger." Li Qi Ma looked towards the front of the violent storm and sighed.

"Heavenly Man Realm spirit domain self-destruction, its power is not trivial, enough to threaten any Mahayana existence. What's more, Wen Tai Sui's residual soul used a time spirit domain. Shi Dao friend had just escaped, his power shouldn't have fully recovered, and it's likely that he's already..." Liu Zai also sighed.

Jiao San's eyebrows furrowed slightly, and his eyes flashed with a hint of anxiety.

"Hmph! That old madman dying is for the better, every time I see him is unlucky." Qu Lin snorted.

"You little bug, who are you saying died for the better? Just a moment ago, you weren't beaten, and your skin is itching again?" A sudden voice echoed in everyone's ears, and it was Hei Tian Mo Zu.

Qu Lin's body trembled, and his eyes frantically looked around, his face turning pale.

At this moment, a strand of black light flew out from everyone's body, gathering in one place.

Han Li and the others were shocked, and they quickly used their magic to investigate their internal situation, but found nothing out of the ordinary.

The onlookers in the distance also had a strand of black light fly out, gathering towards this place.

All the black lights merged into one, forming a black figure, which was Hei Tian Mo Zu.

Qu Lin saw this scene, and his face turned even paler, standing still and not daring to move.

"Shi Dao friend, your heart magic law has reached the realm of Phantom Heart? It's said that once the heart magic law reaches this realm, one can be indestructible. Even if the physical body and divine soul are killed, one can be reborn in the heart devil of others, and cannot be killed!" Liu Zai said with a look of disbelief.

"Heh heh, that's natural, Wen Tai Sui's suppression of me for so many years has allowed my heart magic law to advance even further!" Hei Tian Mo Zu said with a smile.

"Shi Dao friend's divine powers are boundless, we truly admire him greatly." Jiao San and the others flattered.

Hei Tian Mo Zu was praised by everyone, and he couldn't help but laugh loudly, feeling extremely pleased.

Han Li looked at Hei Tian Mo Zu, and his eyebrows suddenly moved, noticing something.

This person had revived, but the aura he emitted was far weaker than before, and it seemed that this rebirth came with a price.

Qu Lin saw Hei Tian Mo Zu's attention being diverted, and he secretly let out a sigh of relief, quietly moving his body to hide behind the crowd.

"You little bug, where do you think you can escape to?" Hei Tian Mo Zu suddenly turned his attention to Qu Lin, his eyes turning cold, and his body disappeared.

Qu Lin's face changed, and his body flashed with a golden light, instantly transforming into a Devouring Gold Immortal form.

He had just transformed when Hei Tian Mo Zu appeared in front of him, punching him and sending him flying.

Golden shadows flashed, and fist winds raged.

Qu Lin was beaten by Hei Tian Mo Zu, flying through the air, and his cries of pain echoed.

However, Hei Tian Mo Zu's current power was much weaker than before, and although he was still beating Qu Lin, the damage was much less than before.

Moreover, Qu Lin was being beaten this time because of his own big mouth, and it was somewhat deserved, so Han Li and the others didn't try to stop it.
