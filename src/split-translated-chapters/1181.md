Han Li's eyes widened in surprise as he stared at the flames that had erupted from the cauldron. "The flames of the Illusory Truth! I didn't think you had managed to cultivate this spirit flame that can restrain all illusions."

Liu Qing's spiritual domain was shattered, but he didn't show any signs of panic. Instead, a smile spread across his face.

Liu Tianhao was taken aback, and before he could react, a long knife with a strange, blood-like glow appeared out of nowhere and pierced through his abdomen, causing him to spit out blood.

At the same time, two hands radiating a dazzling white light appeared in front of him, pressing against his chest.

Two figures emerged from the shadows, one tall and one short, both of whom were the Heaven Fox tribe's men who had been standing beside Liu Qing earlier.

Liu Tianhao's body began to tremble violently as he spat out blood, his aura rapidly declining.

"Liu Tianhao, you colluded with the people of the Gray Realm and harmed our master. Today, you will pay with your life!" the tall man shouted, his voice filled with anger.

As he spoke, his body began to transform, his appearance changing into that of a middle-aged man in a blue robe, revealing his true identity as Liu Zai.

The blood-like knife in his hand was surrounded by a fearsome aura and a devouring power, which was the Heaven Fox's Blood Knife.

The shorter man pressed his palms against Liu Tianhao's chest, causing two white palm prints to appear, as if they were branded onto his body.

A twisted white light began to surge into Liu Tianhao's body, causing his internal organs to rupture and spew out blood.

Liu Tianhao's body shook violently as he spat out blood, his face contorted in agony.

"Liu Dao friend, although it's not the act of a gentleman to launch a sneak attack, your previous behavior was too despicable, and your current strength is far superior to ours. We had no choice but to resort to this tactic," the shorter man said, his expression serious.

As he spoke, his appearance changed, transforming into a middle-aged man in a white robe, identical to Liu Zai and Liu Tianhao, but with a different aura and expression.

"Liu Zai, Liu Haoran, I didn't expect you both to return to the Heaven Fox tribe. It's no wonder you were able to sneak up on me undetected," Liu Tianhao said, his voice calm despite his gruesome condition.

Liu Qing, Liu Zai, and Liu Haoran watched the scene unfold, their faces changing slightly.

But the Liu Tianhao before them was undoubtedly a real person, with no signs of illusion or anomaly in his aura, spiritual energy, or law fluctuations.

The three of them had reached the pinnacle of their cultivation in the realm of illusions, and they were certain that they had not been deceived.

Liu Zai shouted loudly, his Blood Knife glowing with an intense, blood-like light. With a swift motion, he struck Liu Tianhao's body, causing it to explode into a mess of blood and flesh.

But Liu Zai's expression didn't change, and instead, his eyes became even more serious.

The next moment, his face changed, and he raised his Blood Knife, its blade radiating a fierce, blood-like light that expanded into a protective barrier around him.

But the barrier was immediately shattered, and Liu Zai was sent flying backward, as if he had been struck by an invisible force.

Liu Haoran's expression changed, and his eyes flashed with a crystalline light. He raised his palms, and a brilliant white light burst forth, striking the empty air in front of him.

Another loud explosion echoed through the air, and Liu Haoran was also sent flying backward, his body tumbling through the air like a leaf.

Liu Qing watched the scene unfold, his expression changing dramatically. A gray-white aura erupted from his body, forming a massive spiritual domain around him.

The Heaven Fox tribe's members immediately followed suit, each of them activating their spiritual domains or summoning their magical artifacts to protect themselves and the true spirit of the nine-tailed fox.

The three elders, Fox San, Mu Chang, and the others, also summoned their spiritual domains and magical artifacts to protect Liu Yue.

Han Li, however, remained calm, his eyes fixed on the surroundings as he activated his Nine Yin Demon Eye, scanning the area for any signs of danger.

But despite his efforts, he couldn't find any clues about what had struck Liu Zai and Liu Haoran.

The other tribes watched the commotion unfold, their faces filled with a mixture of surprise and concern.

White Ze let out a soft gasp, his expression changing as he revealed a hint of surprise.

Lichi Ma, who had been standing beside Han Li earlier, approached White Ze.

"Father, what did you see?" Lichi Ma asked in a low voice.

White Ze shook his head slowly, his expression unreadable.
Liu Qing was waiting with bated breath, but the expected attack did not come.

The air in front of him rippled, and a faint, illusory figure slowly materialized. Meanwhile, the scattered remains of Liu Tianhao's body on the ground began to fade away, becoming semi-transparent and merging into the void, disappearing without a trace.

As the last of the remains vanished, the illusory figure solidified into a tangible form, and Liu Tianhao stood before him, his body unscathed, with a smile on his face.

"This is terrible, it's the 'Fantasy Reality'!" Liu Qing exclaimed, his face changing color multiple times.

The Tianhu tribe members were shocked by Liu Qing's words, their faces filled with horror.

"Le Er, what is the 'Fantasy Reality' that Liu Qing mentioned?" Han Li asked Liu Le Er, who was still reeling from the shock.

"'Fantasy Reality' is a legendary divine technique of the Tianhu tribe, created by our ancestor, the Nine-Tailed Fox Saint. Apart from the Nine-Tailed Fox Saint, only Liu Qi, the elder of our tribe, has successfully cultivated this technique in our history. It's said that once this technique is used, any damage received will be transformed into an illusion and disappear, leaving the body unharmed. It's an unbeatable technique," Liu Le Er explained, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Such a technique actually exists!" Han Li was shocked by Liu Le Er's words.

Liu Zi and Liu Haoran, who had been knocked back, quickly regained their composure and were about to counterattack when they heard Liu Qing's words. They froze in mid-air, their movements halted.

"You can actually cultivate Master's technique... how is that possible?" Liu Zi muttered to himself, his expression filled with incredulity.

"Heh heh, his physical body is in my hands, and cultivating this technique is child's play. You two are incompetent and will never be able to imagine the benefits of his physical body for cultivation!" Liu Tianhao sneered, his eyes gleaming with pride.

Liu Zi and Liu Haoran's faces darkened, and their bodies began to glow with a fierce light. Their hair grew longer and sharper, and their fingers transformed into razor-sharp claws.

The two of them instantly transformed into half-human, half-beast creatures, surrounded by a layer of gray-white light that seemed to take on a life of its own. Their clothes fluttered wildly, and their auras radiated an intense, feral energy.

Just as they were about to attack, a stern voice echoed through the air, and Bai Ze descended from above.

"Enough! This is the interior of the Xiu Luo Blood Gate, and it cannot withstand such intense clashes. You must settle your internal conflicts outside of here."

The four of them quickly reined in their powers, their faces stern.

However, Liu Qing's eyes still held a deep-seated hatred for Liu Tianhao.

Han Li, who had been watching from a distance, turned his attention to Liu Tianhao. "Liu Tianhao, could he be another body of Liu Qi's?" he asked Huo San in a low voice.

"That's right, Liu Tianhao is indeed another body of Liu Qi's. And you've seen him before," Huo San replied, his voice barely above a whisper.

"I've seen him?" Han Li was taken aback.

As soon as he saw Liu Tianhao, he felt a sense of familiarity.

"The Gray Realm, the Cleansing Pool!" Huo San's voice was low and mysterious.

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise. "You mean, the giant fox that time wasn't Liu Qi, but him!"

Huo San's expression was grim. "I was deceived by him, and I even helped him escape. What a grave mistake!"

Han Li's thoughts were racing. "What did Liu Tianhao do to make your tribe hate him so much? And what about Liu Qi, is he really dead?"

Huo San's eyes flashed with anger. "As far as I know, Liu Qi is indeed dead, and it was all because of Liu Tianhao's treachery. He colluded with outsiders and killed Liu Qi!"

Han Li's eyes widened in shock. No wonder Liu Qing and the others were so hostile towards Liu Tianhao. But why did Liu Zi and Liu Haoran, who were Liu Qi's bodies, also harbor such hatred towards Liu Tianhao? Was it because Liu Tianhao killed Liu Qi?

According to Han Li's knowledge, the relationship between the three bodies and the main body was one of opposition, with the three bodies seeking to kill the main body and take its place. But Liu Zi and Liu Haoran's attitudes seemed to be one of loyalty towards Liu Qi.

"The relationship between the three bodies and the main body is not as simple as you think," a voice echoed in Han Li's mind. It was the spirit of the Palm of Heaven, the bottle spirit.

"Three bodies, although they have the instinct to kill the main body and take its place, are also living beings with their own minds and thoughts. They are not beyond being tamed. And Liu Qi's cultivation of the Fantasy Reality technique is particularly skilled at controlling the minds of others. Taming the two bodies is not a difficult task."

Han Li's eyes sparkled with understanding. "Bottle spirit, you're awake!"

The bottle spirit's voice was stern. "You're in grave danger, Han Li. If Liu Tianhao attacks you, even I may not be able to save you in time."

Han Li sighed. "I didn't expect things to turn out this way. But I hope you're prepared to intervene at any moment."

The bottle spirit's voice was surprised. "Your time law crystals have not only recovered from the previous consumption, but they've also increased in number. You're quite confident, aren't you?"
