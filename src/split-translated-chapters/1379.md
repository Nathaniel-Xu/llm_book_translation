Outside the Heavens Domain.

Han Li's flying figure suddenly stopped, looking down, and let out a soft exclamation.

"This aura is..." Jin Tong also sensed a aura coming from below, muttering to himself.

Han Li was about to cast a spell to investigate, but his mind suddenly felt a pang of pain, and a scene appeared in his mind, which was the scene of the battle between the Master of the Reincarnation Hall, the Demon Master, and Guo Hui.

At the same time, a strange emotion surged into his mind, filled with hatred towards Guo Hui.

This emotion was coming from the Master of the Reincarnation Hall.

As Han Li sensed the Master of the Reincarnation Hall's emotions, he also felt that his own thoughts were being sensed by the Master of the Reincarnation Hall.

Between the two of them, there was a sudden sense of mental connection.

Han Li was taken aback, and immediately made a hand seal, a golden lightning bolt shot out from his sleeve, and disappeared into the void.

He then pulled Jin Tong beside him, and the two of them disappeared in a flash of lightning.

At the same time, in the sky above the Heavenly Palace Continent.

The Master of the Reincarnation Hall, the Demon Master, and Guo Hui had broken out into another fierce battle.

The three of them had opened up their respective spiritual domains, and the three giant spiritual domains of gold, silver, and dark red were fiercely intertwined.

In an instant, numerous spatial channels, temporal channels, and reincarnation channels were opened, connecting multiple planes, and countless forces were forcibly drawn from those planes into the three spiritual domains.

After a fierce collision, the three of them flew backward.

The Demon Master's figure steadied, and he raised his hands, grasping at the void, his fingers flashing with silver light.

His spatial spiritual domain immediately flashed with silver light, and dozens of mountain-sized silver giants jumped out, tightly adhering to Guo Hui's golden spiritual domain.

These giants looked exceptionally large and powerful, with features identical to the Demon Master, and their bodies were covered in a squirming silver light crystal, which was the fragmented spatial force condensed, filled with violent spatial law forces, and emitting a piercing, ear-piercing sound.

"Boom!"

The Demon Master made a hand seal, and the dozens of silver giants let out a sharp cry, exploding and turning into dozens of silver mushroom clouds, releasing an endless amount of spatial destruction force.

"Rip!" Guo Hui's golden spiritual domain was torn open, revealing a massive gap.

The Master of the Reincarnation Hall's figure appeared in front of the gap, his fist striking out.

Behind him, the space was shaking, and a massive six-path reincarnation disk appeared, as large as a star.

The reincarnation disk was covered in countless complex patterns, and on each of its six corners, numerous illusory shadows of various tribes were flashing, including humans, demons, devils, ghosts, and others, as if all living beings in the world were gathered here.

As the reincarnation disk rotated, it seemed that anyone could not escape the cycle of reincarnation.

The rapidly rotating reincarnation disk charged into Guo Hui's golden spiritual domain.

An indescribable aura burst out, several times stronger than when he killed the Bone Emperor.

Guo Hui's golden spiritual domain shook violently, and a massive crack appeared, the area around the reincarnation disk was shattered like porcelain.

The Master of the Reincarnation Hall's body was covered in dense, dark red patterns, his already sunken cheeks sank even deeper, as if his flesh and blood had been drained.

He was oblivious to all this, muttering to himself, his hand making a seal, and striking out.

A thick, dark red light shot out from his palms, merging into the reincarnation disk.

The six-path reincarnation disk was like a hungry beast, immediately expanding to nearly twice its original size, and its light intensified, the entire disk vibrating wildly.

The nearby golden spiritual domain shook violently, and a large area collapsed and shattered.

The six-path reincarnation disk's speed increased tenfold, carrying an unstoppable aura, crushing everything in its path, the golden spiritual domain shattering inch by inch, until it reached Guo Hui.

Seeing the reincarnation disk's aura, Guo Hui's expression turned serious, and he made a hand seal.

A golden gauze shot out from his body, covered in countless golden light points, radiating countless golden lights, like a golden star river.

Endless temporal law forces emanated from it, and this golden gauze was obviously an extremely powerful divine artifact, far surpassing a second-grade divine artifact, and close to a first-grade divine artifact.

The star river gauze expanded, turning into nine massive golden light screens, blocking the way.

The golden light screens had just been set up when the six-path reincarnation disk crashed into them.

A series of "boom" sounds echoed, and the air was filled with brilliant golden flames, as the golden light screens shattered one by one.

In an instant, the nine light screens were destroyed, and the golden gauze reappeared, but it had already been torn into over a dozen pieces.

However, the six-path reincarnation disk's speed slowed down for a moment.

Guo Hui made a hand seal, and his body transformed into countless residual shadows, before disappearing into the void.

The torn golden gauze ignited, and countless golden stars shot out, falling into the surrounding spiritual domains.

The spiritual domains' golden light was like a fire that had been ignited, immediately beginning to surge and flow, and a vast, turbulent golden star river appeared, engulfing the six-path reincarnation disk, the Master of the Reincarnation Hall, and the Demon Master who was following closely behind.

Endless temporal forces flowed from the star river, as if time was mercilessly passing, and no one could escape.

The Demon Master was caught off guard, and before he could even let out a cry, he was swallowed up by the star river.
The six paths of reincarnation disk was suddenly enveloped by the golden star river, causing it to tremble.

The master of the reincarnation hall's pupils constricted, and his hands immediately formed a wheel-like seal, causing the runes on the disk to shine brightly, stabilizing it and violently suppressing Guo Huo's body.

With a "poof" sound, Guo Huo's body transformed into a ball of golden light, dispersing into the air.

The master of the reincarnation hall was taken aback, his hands relaxing, causing the disk to miss its mark and shoot forward a short distance before coming to a stop.

At this moment, the turbulent golden star river surrounding them suddenly flashed, changing direction and swirling into a massive golden whirlpool.

The tearing force around them suddenly increased several times, causing the six paths of reincarnation disk to become unstable, spinning wildly as it was drawn into the whirlpool.

The master of the reincarnation hall's hands shot out, forming a seal.

The runes on the disk burst forth with a brilliant light, rapidly rotating and emitting a terrifying howl.

The powerful law of reincarnation erupted from the disk, resisting the tearing force of the golden whirlpool, and quickly stabilizing.

But at this moment, the nearby golden whirlpool flashed again, releasing countless golden chains that wrapped around the six paths of reincarnation disk, forming a cage.

Each chain emitted a powerful time law fluctuation, which was biased towards restraint.

A surge of time law fluctuations burst forth from the golden chain cage, causing the rapidly rotating disk to come to a sudden stop, as if it had been sealed.

The master of the reincarnation hall was also bound by several chains, unable to move.

A figure flashed above the golden whirlpool, and Guo Huo appeared, his finger pointing.

A golden arrow shot out from his finger, wrapped in golden lightning, but it was not a lightning law, but a pure time law.

The golden arrow's speed was astonishing, and it instantly appeared in front of the master of the reincarnation hall, striking his head.

The master of the reincarnation hall looked at the golden arrow in front of him, but did not panic, a faint smile appearing on his lips.

The golden spiritual realm above the void stirred, and a golden lightning sword broke through the air, wrapped in golden lightning.

Below the sword, a figure flashed, and a blue-robed man appeared, who was Han Li.

He did not look at the situation, but instead punched out.

A golden fist shot out, which was the Great Five Elements Annihilation Fist.

With his current cultivation, the move was even more mysterious, drawing a "ä¹‹" shape in the air, striking the golden arrow.

A loud explosion sounded, and the golden arrow shattered, dispersing into the air.

"Ah, it's you! You're still alive? That's good, I'll take care of you myself!" Guo Huo saw Han Li appear, his eyes narrowing, his arm rising, about to do something.

Han Li's back flashed with golden light, and a rapidly rotating golden wheel appeared, his figure instantly disappearing, reappearing in front of the master of the reincarnation hall, his hand chopping down.

A golden flame erupted from his hand, which was the flame of the Time Severing Torch, transforming into a golden fire sword, striking the golden chain cage.

A loud tearing sound echoed, and the golden chain cage was severed, releasing the master of the reincarnation hall, who thanked Han Li.

Guo Huo's eyes widened in shock, but he did not chase after Han Li, instead disappearing into the surrounding spiritual realm.

The golden whirlpool flashed and disappeared, transforming back into the golden spiritual realm, which had been restored to its original state, its area expanding by over a hundred times. Guo Huo's spiritual realm had not solidified like Han Li's, but had instead become a liquid-like state, appearing weak but impossible to destroy.

A massive pressure surged forth from the surroundings, like waves crashing against the shore, accompanied by time law fluctuations that invaded the two, unstoppable.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and his golden light burst forth, as he opened his own time spiritual realm.

A completely solid spiritual realm appeared, containing vast landscapes, which blocked the invasion of the golden spiritual realm, and began to expand.

The surrounding time spiritual realm, which belonged to Guo Huo, flashed wildly, trying to block Han Li's spiritual realm, but was unable to.

However, Han Li's spiritual realm only occupied a small area compared to Guo Huo's, and was not a significant threat.

The master of the reincarnation hall saw this, and a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes, before he transmitted a message to Han Li:

"The demon lord has been swept away by the golden star river, and his whereabouts are unknown... To counter Guo Huo, his power is indispensable, can you help rescue him?"

Han Li's eyes flashed with golden light, and he looked around, his gaze suddenly stopping, before he raised his hand and grasped the void.

A golden light shot out from his hand, disappearing into the golden star river.

A figure was pulled out, and it was the demon lord.

"Ah, it's you! You're still alive? That's good, I'll take care of you myself!" Guo Huo saw Han Li appear, his eyes narrowing, his arm rising, about to do something.

Han Li's back flashed with golden light, and a rapidly rotating golden wheel appeared, his figure instantly disappearing, reappearing in front of the master of the reincarnation hall, his hand chopping down.

A golden flame erupted from his hand, which was the flame of the Time Severing Torch, transforming into a golden fire sword, striking the golden chain cage.

A loud tearing sound echoed, and the golden chain cage was severed, releasing the master of the reincarnation hall, who thanked Han Li.

Guo Huo's eyes widened in shock, but he did not chase after Han Li, instead disappearing into the surrounding spiritual realm.

The golden whirlpool flashed and disappeared, transforming back into the golden spiritual realm, which had been restored to its original state, its area expanding by over a hundred times. Guo Huo's spiritual realm had not solidified like Han Li's, but had instead become a liquid-like state, appearing weak but impossible to destroy.

A massive pressure surged forth from the surroundings, like waves crashing against the shore, accompanied by time law fluctuations that invaded the two, unstoppable.

A completely solid spiritual realm appeared, containing vast landscapes, which blocked the invasion of the golden spiritual realm, and began to expand.

The surrounding time spiritual realm, which belonged to Guo Huo, flashed wildly, trying to block Han Li's spiritual realm, but was unable to.

Han Li's eyes flashed with golden light, and he looked around, his gaze suddenly stopping, before he raised his hand and grasped the void.

A golden light shot out from his hand, disappearing into the golden star river.

A figure was pulled out, and it was the demon lord.
