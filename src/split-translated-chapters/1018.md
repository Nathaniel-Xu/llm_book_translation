Here is the translation of the chapter:

"Reporting to the heavenly messenger, after Elder Lu reported to me, I felt that the matter was extremely important, so I immediately sealed off the information. Now, only the two of us know about it within the entire sect, and to prevent any unexpected surprises, we have also kept it hidden from the other cultivators who are currently residing in the lake's water palace."

The young master of the Suo Liu Sect, a handsome and elegant youth, quickly spoke up.

"This is good, we won't have to waste our energy destroying the entire sect..." Dongfang Bai nodded, seemingly lost in thought.

The young master and the old man with a round face exchanged a glance, both of them furrowing their brows in suspicion, their eyes filled with doubt.

However, before they could think clearly, they suddenly found themselves frozen in place, unable to move even a single limb.

The only thing they could move was their eyeballs, which they used to look at each other in shock and horror. They discovered that a layer of green, slimy moss had grown on their bodies, and on top of the moss, a large, beautiful flower had bloomed.

"No..."

As the young master let out a pained cry, the flower burst into bloom, its color turning a deep red, and its surface even exuding a few drops of crystal clear dew. It looked incredibly beautiful and alluring.

In contrast, the two men wrapped in the moss seemed to have had their life force drained away, their skin dry and withered, like two ugly, mummified corpses.

Dongfang Bai glanced at them expressionlessly, then turned to ask, "Elder Lu, is that person's aura still present here?"

"It is still present," the old man, who looked like a rat spirit, replied, wrinkling his nose.

"As long as he is still here, that's good," Dongfang Bai said with a smile.

Tao Ji's gaze fell on the vast expanse of water in the distance, his eyes clouding over with uncertainty. However, he couldn't shake off the feeling of unease in his heart.

"Tao Ji, do you have something to say?" Dongfang Bai asked, noticing the change in Tao Ji's expression.

"Palace Master, considering Han Li's past behavior, he is not someone who would be careless. This time, he left behind such an obvious trail, allowing us to track him down. I think there might be something fishy going on," Tao Ji said.

"Is Tao Elder afraid because of what happened last time? How could he possibly escape with the Palace Master here?" the black-robed man sneered.

Dongfang Bai, however, waved his hand and said, "Tao Elder's words make sense, let's be cautious."

Tao Ji quickly bowed in response.

With a flick of his wrist, Dongfang Bai sent a white flying dart shooting out, which instantly arrived above the lake.

"It's that area of the lake," Lu Yun pointed out.

"Palace Master, please wait, let me split open the lake and force him to show himself," the black-robed man said, drawing his ghost-headed knife.

"There's no need, we're guests, we can't just start fighting before we've even entered the door," Dongfang Bai said, smiling faintly.

He raised his finger and pointed at the air, and a green light shot out, disappearing into the lake.

The lake's surface, which had been calm, suddenly erupted into a massive whirlpool, and a giant spiral-shaped hole appeared, leading down to the bottom of the lake where the Gui Qiu water palace was located.

At the same time, a green spiritual domain enveloped the area, trapping the turbulent water within, like a cage. The waves were confined to within the domain, and the outside remained calm and peaceful.

The green light, like a dragon bursting into the sea, crashed into the white light screen, causing a deafening explosion, and the screen shattered. The small hill where the Qing Jing Sect's ancestral temple was located was revealed.

At that moment, Han Li was sitting with Qi Hun in the courtyard, holding a wine cup that had been shaken slightly. However, the amber-colored wine inside didn't spill a drop.

"The array is quite impressive, it seems your previous guess was correct, and it's indeed the Palace Master who has arrived. However, with Taixu realm peak cultivation, he dares to be so arrogant?" Han Li said with a smile, glancing up at the sky.

He then poured out the wine in three gulps, put down the cup, and stood up from the stone stool.

At that moment, the surrounding lake water seemed to be trapped by a strange power, and a whirlpool appeared above the small hill, spinning around without falling.

Dongfang Bai and the others descended from the air, hovering above the courtyard, looking down at Han Li and Qi Hun.

"Brother Han, I've heard a lot about you, and it's an honor to finally meet you," Dongfang Bai said, smiling faintly as he looked Han Li up and down, seemingly unimpressed.
"Tsk, tsk, when did I, Han Li, become so famous that the master of the Jin Yuan Xian Domain would chase after me for so long? It's truly an honor." Han Li said with a hint of sarcasm.

"How dare you, a mere thief, speak to the Eastern Palace Master in such a manner?" Black Knife, who was standing nearby, grew enraged.

"What's wrong? Did I say something incorrect? Then tell me, how should I speak to a madman like you who slaughters innocent people without reason?" Han Li replied coldly, glancing at Black Knife with a hint of disdain.

Black Knife's eyes flashed with anger, and he was about to charge forward, but Eastern White's warning glance stayed him.

LÃ¼ Yun, who was standing nearby, narrowed his eyes as he watched Han Li, a thoughtful expression on his face.

Han Li's gaze fell on the handsome young man standing beside him, and he said with a hint of surprise, "Tao Changlao, I didn't expect to see you again so soon. But since you managed to escape with your life, you should be grateful..."

Tao Changlao noticed Han Li's gaze and swallowed hard, feeling a dryness in his mouth. His eyes flashed with a fierce light, but he didn't say anything.

"Brother Han, considering our identities and positions, why should we care about the lives of mere ants? Let's get to the point. If you're willing to hand over that item, I can consider letting you off the hook, and even recommend you to join the Jiuyuan Observatory. What do you say?" Eastern White chuckled and revealed his true intentions.

As soon as Han Li heard the words "Jiuyuan Observatory", he immediately understood what Eastern White was referring to.

His pupils constricted slightly, and he didn't bother to hide the fact that he possessed the Palm of Heaven. After all, he had no intention of letting any of these people go, lest they spread the news and cause him endless trouble.

Previously, Han Li had been cautious due to various concerns and didn't want to directly confront the Xian Palace forces. However, that didn't mean he was afraid. Now that the other party had repeatedly crossed his bottom line and was still pursuing him, he decided it was time to settle the score.

"I advise you, Brother, not to go against the Heavenly Court. After all, it's better to drink the wine of respect than the wine of punishment. If you're willing to cooperate, you can rest assured and focus on your cultivation. With your talent, as long as you have sufficient resources, reaching the Great Luo Realm is only a matter of time..." Eastern White said, seeing Han Li's thoughtful expression.

"It seems that you not only like to chase after people's behinds, but also talk nonsense like a fart. I don't know what you want, and I don't care. Besides, I like wine, but I won't drink any that's offered by you," Han Li interrupted Eastern White's words, his tone lazy and dismissive.

"Ah, I see that Brother Han is determined to go against the Heavenly Court. What a pity... Since you don't like the wine of respect, I'll have to offer you a cup of punishment instead," Eastern White sighed, a hint of regret in his voice.

As soon as he finished speaking, Black Knife, who had been holding back his anger, suddenly charged forward, his body leaving a trail of residual images. His Ghost Headed Great Knife flashed out of its scabbard, and a dark, blood-red aura erupted from the blade.

A massive, dark cloud descended from the sky, and a giant, ghostly creature emerged from the shadows. Its eyes glowed with an otherworldly energy as it charged towards Han Li and his companion.

Han Li, however, didn't even flinch, his gaze fixed on the creature with a hint of amusement.

"Since I awoke, I've been feeling a bit empty inside. I didn't expect to find such a high-level ghost cultivator in the Xian Palace. This is indeed... a feast," the creature said, its voice dripping with excitement.

"Don't eat too quickly, and be mindful of your digestion," Han Li said with a chuckle.

The creature nodded, its body exploding with energy as it charged towards the dark cloud. It vanished into the shadows, leaving behind an eerie silence.

The dark cloud dissipated, and the ghostly creature reappeared, its body now transformed into a massive, ape-like creature with three glowing red eyes. Its skin was covered in black, razor-sharp fur, and its presence seemed to draw the very air out of the atmosphere.

Eastern White's eyes widened in shock as he realized what he was looking at. "This is... a Xing Beast!"

Black Knife's face turned pale, and he knew he was in trouble. He quickly tried to retract his knife, but it was too late. The Xing Beast had already sensed his presence and was now charging towards him.

The beast's eyes glowed with an intense, blood-red light as it unleashed a massive, blood-colored chain that bound the ghostly creatures, rendering them immobile.
