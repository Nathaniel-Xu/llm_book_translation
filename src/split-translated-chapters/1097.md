The white trees near the square withered and turned black as the blood light from the Tian Huo Hua Knife enveloped them, and the spiritual energy within the white jade stones was drained, causing them to shatter into countless fragments.

In an instant, the spiritual energy within a several hundred-mile radius of the White Jade Square was drained, and a deafening explosion shook the air.

The Tong Tian Sword Array collapsed, and dozens of flying swords scattered in all directions, with over a dozen being split in two.

Lei Yu Ce stumbled backward, his face flushed with an unnatural red glow.

As the blood light vanished, Huo San and Jiao San's figures appeared, having already passed Lei Yu Ce and were flying toward the front.

Lei Yu Ce's eyes twitched, and he was about to act when Huo San's voice echoed from afar, "Lei Dao Friend, you can't stop us. The situation ahead is unclear, and we don't want to fight you. Please don't force us."

Lei Yu Ce's movements froze, and he stood there, stunned.

Huo San and Jiao San's figures disappeared into the distance, and Lan Yuan Zi and Lan Yan transformed into two blue lights, shooting toward the Wood God's Tomb.

"Stop!" Su Zhan Cai shouted, her jade hand grasping at the air.

The surrounding area was filled with flashing blue light, and countless blue water balls appeared, each surrounded by a giant blue electric serpent. The water balls hurtled toward Lan Yuan Zi and Lan Yan, accompanied by the sound of thunder.

Lan Yan remained calm, her jade hand weaving a spell as the small blue bag reappeared, its mouth opening to release a multitude of blue lights.

The water balls halted, then transformed into blue lights, merging into the small blue bag.

The originally majestic water balls vanished, leaving behind an eerie silence.

"What?!" Su Zhan Cai's face revealed an expression of astonishment.

Lan Yan's face turned pale, having expended a large amount of her spiritual energy to control the small blue bag.

Lan Yuan Zi grasped Lan Yan's hand, and their lights merged, increasing their speed as they flashed past Su Zhan Cai and disappeared into the distance.

Han Li's eyes flickered, and he transformed into a golden light, shooting toward the Fire Element Palace.

Wen Zhong noticed Han Li's actions and swiftly intervened, his hands weaving a spell as dozens of hundred-meter-long sword lights shot out, aiming to intercept Han Li.

However, Han Li's golden light suddenly brightened, increasing his speed several times as he effortlessly surpassed Wen Zhong and vanished into the distance.

Wen Zhong's brow furrowed, but he could do nothing.

At this moment, a golden longbow shot forth, and Xiong Shan appeared, his speed almost as fast as Han Li.

Wen Zhong quickly reacted, attempting to intercept Xiong Shan, but the latter's golden longbow was too swift, and Wen Zhong's reaction was delayed.

The golden longbow flashed past Wen Zhong, and Xiong Shan disappeared into the distance.

In the blink of an eye, only Lei Yu Ce, Wen Zhong, and Su Zhan Cai remained on the square.

"These short-sighted fools only care about immediate gains, ignoring the consequences. When the Black Sky Demon God breaks free, they'll regret it!" Wen Zhong exclaimed, his face red with anger.

"They're not from the Golden Source Realm, so they don't know the terror of the Black Sky Demon God. The array's seal contains powerful artifacts, making it understandable that they'd stop at nothing to obtain them. It's clear that they're not simple individuals, and it seems we can't stop them," Su Zhan Cai said, her expression calm.

"Now that things have reached this point, we have no choice but to split up and try to persuade them to abandon the array's treasures. If that fails, we must repair the array's seal," Lei Yu Ce said, his movements unhurried as he retrieved his golden flying swords.

"Indeed, it's come to this. I didn't expect you to remain so calm in this situation, Lei Dao Friend," Su Zhan Cai said, her tone laced with curiosity.

"'Man proposes, God disposes.' The situation is already dire; if we lose our composure, it'll only worsen," Lei Yu Ce replied, shaking his head.

"You still have the heart to joke at a time like this. What's the plan, then?" Su Zhan Cai asked, a hint of a smile on her lips.

Wen Zhong also turned to Lei Yu Ce, awaiting his response.

"Wait a moment," Lei Yu Ce said, producing two sets of array instruments, one red and one yellow, along with two jade slips, which he handed to Wen Zhong and Su Zhan Cai.

"The array's seal is complex and difficult to repair, but the jade slips contain the array's layout method. You only need to follow the instructions to repair it. If you're unable to, send me a message," Lei Yu Ce said, handing Su Zhan Cai a transmission array disk.
Han Li and Wen Zhong, it seemed, had another way to communicate.

Wen Zhong and Su Zhongzi's divine sense entered the jade slip, and they quickly nodded in understanding.

"I'll go first," Wen Zhong said, scanning Han Li and Su Zhongzi with a glance, before turning into a golden streak of light and flying towards the Huoyuan Palace.

"I'll go too," Su Zhongzi said, turning to leave.

"Su Xianzi, the Lan siblings are extremely powerful, and now they've obtained the blue small bag, making them even more formidable. Don't provoke them, and if necessary, let them take the treasure. Prioritize your own safety above all else," Lei Yuze suddenly called out, cautioning Su Zhongzi.

"Thank you, Lei Dao friend, for reminding me. I understand," Su Zhongzi replied, before flying towards the Mushi Mausoleum.

After Su Zhongzi's figure disappeared from view, Lei Yuze shook his head, and with a burst of speed, flew towards the Qiantu Temple.

Not long after the three of them left, three streaks of light flew in from behind, landing on the plaza, revealing the figures of Qimozi, Baigu Yao, and Tongshi Yao.

"It seems those people have arrived, and they seem to have had a confrontation. Now they've split into three groups, heading towards the three array eyes," Baigu Yao said, her eyes flashing with white light as she scanned the surroundings.

"It looks like everything is under your control, Baigu Dao friend," Qimozi said with a smile.

"It's just a small trick, but now those people have split into three groups. It's easy to eliminate one of them. Shall we make a move?" Baigu Yao asked, smiling again.

"Not yet, those people are mostly here to steal the treasure. We can let them help us break the array eye's seal and release your three brothers. Let's just observe for now," Qimozi said, shaking his head.

Baigu Yao nodded slightly.

"Since they've split into three groups, we should do the same. There are precious treasures at the three array eyes, and we can't let those people get them," Qimozi said.

Baigu Yao and Tongshi Yao thought of the power of the Dahuang ancient sword and the blue small bag, and their hearts skipped a beat. They immediately nodded and flew towards the Qiantu Temple and the Mushi Mausoleum.

Qimozi watched them leave, a cold smile flashing on his lips, before he vanished into thin air.

Han Li flew forward along the staircase, flying for a while before realizing that Lei Yuze and the others hadn't followed him. His face relaxed slightly.

Although he wasn't afraid of Lei Yuze and the others, as Fox Three had said earlier, the situation ahead was unclear, and Lei Yuze and the others didn't seem to have any malicious intentions towards him. If possible, he didn't want to fight them.

Han Li looked ahead, his eyes flashing with a hint of excitement, and his speed increased again.

He didn't want to fight Lei Yuze and the others, but he didn't want to give up the treasure in the array eye either. As for the Black Heaven Demon God that Lei Yuze had mentioned, he didn't particularly care.

With his current abilities, as long as he didn't face a Dao ancestor, he was confident in his ability to protect himself.

After all, he had already gained a lot from entering this tower, and if something unexpected happened, he could just leave. Even if he couldn't find a way out, he could always retreat.

As for the Years God Lamp that was suppressing the tower, he had some ideas, but it wasn't something he had to obtain. Safety was the top priority.

The staircase was unexpectedly long, and he flew for a full quarter of an hour without seeing the end.

However, a white mist began to appear in the air around him, floating and dancing in the wind.

This mist wasn't ordinary mist, as it contained threads of spiritual energy. Although it wasn't harmful, it greatly obstructed his vision.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he slowed down, spreading his divine sense to investigate the surroundings.

After flying for a bit longer, his eyes lit up, and he flew forward with increased speed.

The scenery ahead expanded, and he saw a plaza on the mountain wall, with a black volcanic rock pavement and numerous small airholes, from which wisps of smoke were rising.

Behind the plaza stood a massive, fire-red temple with a red door, red pillars, and a roof covered in red glazed tiles, which seemed to be shrouded in a layer of heat, making the air around it seem distorted.

Although he was separated from the temple by a wide plaza, Han Li could still feel a scorching heat wave, like a wave of water, surging out from the temple and spreading in all directions.

This time, he didn't rush to enter the plaza, but instead narrowed his eyes, and with a flash of purple light, he used his Jiu You Demon Eyes to scan the plaza.

After a moment, he didn't notice anything unusual, nor did he sense any similarity to the blue temple he had encountered earlier.

He felt a slight sense of relief, and with a calm expression, he descended onto the black plaza.
