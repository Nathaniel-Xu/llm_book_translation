The swarm of insects flew swiftly towards them, but suddenly stopped and began to circle around when they were above Su Zhongxi and the others. The crowd's hearts were filled with shock, and even Han Li's brow furrowed in concern.

Fortunately, the swarm split apart after a short while, breaking into smaller groups that flew off in different directions. Some of the fireflies flew into the volcanic lava, and they seemed to be enjoying themselves, chirping happily as they disappeared into the distance.

The crowd breathed a sigh of relief.

"It seems that the source of those fireflies is deep within the volcanic region," Su Zhongxi said. "It's no wonder, considering their bodies contain the flames of time, which are a type of fire-attribute spirit insect. They seem to thrive in this scorching environment."

"Let's go take a look," Su Zhongxi said, leading the way.

The others followed, with Mo Xiang Louzhu's brow furrowed in concern. They flew for about half an hour before arriving at a massive mountain range, with two gigantic peaks that seemed to pierce the clouds. The valley between the peaks was filled with a swarm of fireflies, blocking out the sun.

The swarm they had encountered earlier was nothing compared to this. The stone walls of the peaks had numerous small holes, like a beehive, with countless fireflies flying in and out. The peaks seemed to be two giant beehives.

In the depths of the valley, there was a black cave that seemed to be bottomless. The cave was filled with a strange energy, similar to a seal, that prevented spiritual awareness from penetrating too deeply. However, they could still sense the strong time laws emanating from within, along with spatial fluctuations.

The group hid behind a small hill, using their abilities to conceal their tracks.

"It seems that the cave contains a treasure that holds the power of time laws," Su Zhongxi said, her eyes shining with excitement. "There are quite a few of them, and it's not a wasted trip. The spatial fluctuations within the cave are similar to the spatial gates we encountered earlier, so the entrance to the third layer must be inside."

Han Li's eyes gleamed with excitement as he gazed at the valley.

Although his cultivation was high, he lacked sufficient time law crystals within his body. If he could obtain some treasures that held the power of time, it would be extremely beneficial to him.

However, Mo Xiang Louzhu and the others seemed to be hesitant, their faces pale.

"Don't worry, Mo Xiang Louzhu, I have a way to deal with these fireflies," Su Zhongxi said, noticing their concern.

Mo Xiang Louzhu shook his head firmly. "Su Daozhu, you and your friends are skilled and bold, but my Mo Xiang Lou is just a small sect with limited abilities. This is too dangerous for us. I'm afraid we cannot accompany you further."

The group decided to leave, with Mo Xiang Louzhu and the others choosing to search for treasures in the volcanic region instead of risking their lives to explore the cave.

Su Zhongxi and Jin Liu's faces fell, and they were about to speak when the old man with the hunched back suddenly said, "I also don't have the confidence to break through this place. I'll bid you farewell, and I wish you good luck."

The others followed his lead, and soon over twenty people stood beside Mo Xiang Louzhu and the old man.

Only a dozen people remained, including Han Li, the three from the Tian Shui Sect, the master of the Qing Suo Valley, the burly man, and a few other lone cultivators.

"Ha! I didn't expect that you, who are considered to be prominent figures in the outside world, would retreat at the first sign of difficulty," Jin Liu sneered.

Mo Xiang Louzhu and the others didn't respond, instead choosing to leave. Han Li watched them with a cold gaze.

Although Mo Xiang Louzhu and the others seemed timid, they were actually being cautious. The number of fireflies was staggering, and the risk of breaking through was too great. If Han Li didn't have the time law crystals within his body, he wouldn't have chosen to take this risk either.

"Wait, please don't leave," Su Zhongxi said, standing in front of them with a blue glow surrounding her.

Mo Xiang Louzhu's face darkened. "What do you mean, Su Daozhu? Are you trying to detain us?"

The others also looked displeased.

"I apologize if I've caused any misunderstanding," Su Zhongxi said calmly. "I won't stop you from leaving, but I have a favor to ask of you before you go."
"What's the matter, Su Xianzi, please tell us," Mo Xiang Louzhu asked, his expression slightly relaxed.

"As you said, Louzhu, there are many fire years of fireflies here, and it's very difficult to sneak into the mountain cave. So, I'd like to ask you all to help us divert the fireflies when you leave," Su Xianzi said with a faint smile.

"Let us show ourselves to divert the fireflies? This is no different from playing with fire, Su Xianzi, are you joking?" the hunchbacked old man sneered.

"Don't worry, I have a few flying shadow symbols here that can increase your speed by at least 30% for a short time and help conceal your aura, so you can definitely escape the fireflies' pursuit," Su Xianzi said, flipping out five blue talismans with intricate wind and cloud patterns, emitting a strong wind attribute law fluctuation.

The hunchbacked old man raised an eyebrow, but didn't say anything, still standing there.

"Of course, I won't let you do this for nothing. These few magical instruments are my treasured possessions, and whoever is willing to help can choose one," Su Xianzi said, waving her hand again, and five or six magical instruments, including a jade ruler and a water-attribute bowl, appeared in front of her, emitting strong law fluctuations, clearly of high quality.

"Since Su Xianzi is so sincere, we naturally want to help. What do you need us to do?" the hunchbacked old man asked, his eyes flashing with a hint of joy, as he took a water-blue bowl and a flying shadow symbol.

Mo Xiang Louzhu and the others also showed some interest.

"I have five blood cloud beads here, which can explode and create a large amount of blood cloud. Fireflies are sensitive to blood energy, so if we explode them one after another, we should be able to attract most of the fireflies in the valley. I need five fellow daoists to help me," Su Xianzi said, waving her hand, and five egg-sized blood-colored beads appeared in her palm, emitting a bright blood light.

Han Li looked at the blood-colored beads, and his eyes flashed with interest.

The beads contained a very rich blood energy, and a hint of blood law, which was a kind of blood lightning.

"Su Xianzi has thought this through, and these blood cloud beads are indeed the best way to attract the fireflies. I'll take care of this, don't worry," the hunchbacked old man said, taking a blood cloud bead and patting his chest, his attitude completely opposite to his previous cold demeanor.

Seeing the hunchbacked old man's sudden change in attitude, the others felt a bit disdainful.

Mo Xiang Louzhu hesitated for a moment, then stepped forward and took a blood cloud bead, a magical instrument, and a flying shadow symbol.

Three other scattered golden immortals, who thought they were fast enough, stepped forward and each took a blood cloud bead, a magical instrument, and a flying shadow symbol.

Except for the hunchbacked old man and the other four, the others who were planning to leave immediately flew away, disappearing into the distance.

"Then, I'll trouble the five of you," Su Xianzi said, after the others had left.

"Don't worry, Su fellow daoist, I'll take care of it," the hunchbacked old man said, flying out first, heading towards the distant mountain valley.

A few breaths later, a loud muffled sound came from the mountain valley, followed by a large amount of sticky blood cloud, which spread out like a sea wave.

The fireflies in the valley immediately became chaotic, spewing out flames of years, and the blood cloud disappeared in a few breaths.

The hunchbacked old man's figure appeared near the mountain valley, and then turned into a bright escape light, with a layer of special green light on top, flying rapidly towards the distance.

The insect swarm near the mountain valley let out a shrill cry, and a large group of fireflies chased after him, making up about 10% of the total swarm.

In the distance, behind the short mountain, Su Xianzi's face showed a hint of joy, and she immediately looked at the other four.

Mo Xiang Louzhu didn't say anything, and flew out, releasing a layer of spiritual light that wrapped around his body, concealing his aura, and approached the mountain valley from another direction.

Then, he released a blood cloud bead, attracting the attention of many fireflies, and immediately revealed his figure, escaping rapidly.

A large group of fireflies chased after him, similar in number to the hunchbacked old man's.

"Quick! Next one!" Su Xianzi urged.

The five people's plan to attract the fireflies had to be fast, or else the swarm would return and cause trouble.

"Take care, everyone!"

A scattered golden immortal flew out, releasing a blood cloud bead, and attracting a group of fireflies, before escaping rapidly.

The remaining two also followed the same plan, using blood cloud beads to attract a group of fireflies.

At this point, the swarm in the mountain valley had decreased significantly, leaving only less than half.

"Now, let's go!"

Su Xianzi shouted, and took out the yellow small flag, waving it once, and turning it into a yellow cloud that enveloped the group of over ten people, including Han Li, and flew rapidly towards the mountain valley.

In an instant, they merged into the ground, and flew underground, approaching the mountain valley.
