Yi Zong had been waiting for a long time for the three people in purple clothes to make their move.

As soon as he saw them, their figures flashed and they fell onto the scorpion's head, which was part of the Heaven Scourge Great Array. A burst of light erupted from beneath them, and their slender bodies transformed into the body of an ant queen, merging with the giant scorpion. The spirits of all the insects within the Heaven Scourge Great Array also began to glow with a faint light, and a powerful aura that surpassed the Great Luo Peak emanated from them.

They were burning their own lives to provide the array with endless energy!

Yi Zong's eyes flashed with white light, and his original vitality was no longer visible. With a wave of his hand, the scorpion's claws on either side of him struck out simultaneously, with a white and cyan light bursting forth from the tips.

In an instant, a powerful icy aura spread out, instantly freezing the old man in blue robes who was charging towards him. On the other side, a wave of green flames erupted, clashing with the purple flames of the woman in purple clothes, sending sparks flying everywhere.

The green flames seemed to have a sticky quality, merging with the purple flames and quickly engulfing them. The flames then surged towards the woman in purple clothes.

The ice wall and sea of flames that had appeared were like two gates that had closed, protecting the Golden Boy inside.

Yin Wu Shuang, who was flying overhead, saw the high and proud tail spike of the golden hook and did not dare to charge forward.

It was clear that the power of the Heaven Scourge Great Array far exceeded their expectations.

Xuan Yuan Jie's eyebrows furrowed slightly as he watched the scene unfold.

He had not wanted to take action himself, as using the power of the laws would attract the attention of the Heavenly Dao. But if he waited too long, it would be too late to stop Qi Lin from returning to his position as the Dao Ancestor.

"Get out of the way," he shouted, taking a step forward and assuming a bowing stance. A yellow light condensed on his fist, forming a massive yellow whirlpool that seemed to be about to strike.

Just as he was about to attack, a figure suddenly appeared behind him, a middle-aged man in a soft blue armor, holding a dark green spiral spear that he thrust towards Xuan Yuan Jie's ear.

The man was Qing Feng, who had already cleared the area of the Heaven Demons. He had not dispersed the Heaven Demon Cloud in order to hide his movements, waiting for the perfect moment to launch a surprise attack.

The spiral spear in his hand was his treasured artifact, a rare three-star celestial artifact. If he could land a hit, it would be enough to injure Xuan Yuan Jie.

But just as he was about to strike, Xuan Yuan Jie suddenly smiled and the yellow whirlpool on his fist dissipated. Instead, a metallic glow appeared behind his ear.

Qing Feng realized he had been tricked and felt a surge of fear. His body folded in mid-air, and he retreated, no longer attacking Xuan Yuan Jie. He landed on the giant hand that held Frostwhite, his spear flashing with light as he struck down the law-sealing chains that bound him.

With a swift motion, Qing Feng pulled Frostwhite out of the giant hand and turned to face Xuan Yuan Jie, who was watching him with a hint of approval.

"Your concealment technique is quite good, even I didn't notice it at first," Xuan Yuan Jie said. "But you shouldn't have landed on this earth."

Qing Feng looked down at the ground and suddenly realized his mistake. With his current mastery of concealment techniques, he could hide from Xuan Yuan Jie's divine sense in the void, but as soon as he landed on the ground, Xuan Yuan Jie would discover him.

He had to settle for rescuing Frostwhite instead of killing Xuan Yuan Jie.

"I don't have time to deal with you now," Xuan Yuan Jie said, waving his hand. "Once I've finished killing your master, I can spare your lives and let you serve me."

The entire suspended continent shook violently, and the ground began to churn and boil, sending waves of yellow earth towards Qing Feng and Frostwhite.

As the earth waves approached, Qing Feng and Frostwhite felt their bodies slow down, and they were soon engulfed by the waves.

Xuan Yuan Jie did not bother to look back, focusing instead on the Heaven Scourge Great Array. He raised his fist, and a massive yellow whirlpool condensed on it, filled with the power of the laws.

A layer of yellow light appeared on his upper body, and the air around him began to distort and tremble.

"Ha!" Xuan Yuan Jie shouted, unleashing a powerful punch that sent the whirlpool surging forward.

A massive storm of yellow wind and earth erupted, sweeping towards the Golden Boy. The celestial warriors of the Heavenly Court retreated in all directions, but the insect army charged forward, eager to meet the storm head-on.

In an instant, millions of insects were annihilated by the storm.

Frostwhite and Qing Feng, trapped in the earth waves, watched in horror as the storm approached.

Yi Zong, facing the storm head-on, felt a chill run down his spine. He could only gamble with his life to meet the attack.
Only hearing his mouth utter a long roar, the white light in his eyes grew stronger, and the power of the law on his body also began to burn, the insect tribe in the Scorpion Great Array was even more desperate, burning their own lives to the fullest.

The entire Scorpion Great Array finally released its full power at this moment, the entire array turned from a dark blue and black color to a snowy white and transparent color, the internal spirit insect silhouette had disappeared, leaving only a few bright lights.

The two claws on his feet, the cyan and white lights, also brightened to the extreme, the ice and green flames spread out tens of thousands of feet, forming two ice and fire oceans, simultaneously colliding with the yellow earth vortex.

"Boom, boom, boom..."

A series of intense explosion sounds, kept rolling in from the collision, different laws of power collided, instantly causing the space to distort, a black hole appeared in the middle.

All the ice and green flames were absorbed by the black hole, rushing in and disappearing.

The external space, which originally had little light, at this moment, almost all the light was absorbed by the black hole, the surroundings fell into darkness.

This lasted for tens of breaths, before the black hole slowly disappeared, the surrounding light slowly returning to normal.

The original Scorpion Annihilation Array had disappeared, all the millions of spirit insects that had been arranged, had turned into flying ash, only leaving behind the damaged half-body of the Ant Nuo, still floating in front of the Golden Beetle.

"Blocked, blocked..." Her mouth was bleeding, her expression was miserable, but her eyes had a hint of light.

However, before Ant Nuo could rejoice, the space in front of her suddenly shook violently, another giant yellow fist shadow broke through the air, about to smash down.

She floated calmly in the air, not dodging, they had risked their lives to block the Primeval Dao Ancestor's attack, if they couldn't protect the Insect Ancestor's path, they would rather fall together.

This huge difference in power was really too despairing...

Ant Nuo slowly closed her eyes, having escaped once, this time she didn't want to escape again.

The boundless earth attribute law power, had already rolled in, compressing the space, causing it to collapse layer by layer.

"No..." Qing Feng and Shuang Bai saw this scene, and both let out a unwilling roar.

However, just as they did, a sudden change occurred!

Only seeing Ant Nuo's head, a Taiyi-level Devouring Golden Immortal suddenly burst out of the space crack, with a tall, blue-robed man riding on its back.

The moment he appeared, he stepped on the Devouring Golden Immortal's back, his body agile, he leaped and landed in front of Ant Nuo, raising his hand to strike.

Only seeing a golden light shoot out, forming a giant golden treasure wheel suspended in mid-air, the world's Dao patterns shining brightly, releasing a rich, golden light, gathering into a giant light column, colliding with the yellow earth fist.

The two collided, but there was no loud noise, the fist was as if it had hit a bunch of cotton, without any damage, its speed slowed down.

"Zi la la..."

Accompanied by a sound of electric light flowing, the 72 Qing Bamboo Wasp Cloud Swords flew out, swirling around the golden light column, like 72 golden dragons, stabbing into the giant fist.

"Boom" a thunderous roar shook the sky!

Tens of thousands of golden lightning rays burst out, the yellow earth fist was instantly shattered, turning into countless fragments, dispersing.

"Who is..."

Ant Nuo felt the changes in the air, slowly opening her eyes, but only saw the back of a human male.

Just as she was wondering, she heard Xuan Yuan Jie's voice come from the other side of the continent:

"Who are you?"

"I am Han Li!" The human cultivator stood with his hands behind his back, loudly answering.

The tall, human male, was naturally Han Li, who had been riding the Taiyi Devouring Golden Immortal, chasing after him.

As soon as he finished speaking, the golden treasure wheel suddenly reversed, floating behind Han Li, the 72 Qing Bamboo Wasp Cloud Swords also turned into flowing lights, floating behind him, making his back look majestic, with an air of elegance.

"Han Li? I didn't expect it to be you! Good kid, you're quite bold, daring to appear in front of me!" Xuan Yuan Jie looked Han Li up and down, coldly saying.

It was clear that he already knew of Han Li's existence.

"You're Xuan Yuan Jie, right? It was you who caused the Golden Boy to fall from the Dao Ancestor's position, and he had to self-destruct his Dao Ancestor's body, scattering it throughout the vast immortal realm?" Han Li's face didn't change, not afraid, loudly asking back.

"Ah, you're quite knowledgeable, but what does it have to do with you?" Xuan Yuan Jie sneered, his eyes narrowing.
