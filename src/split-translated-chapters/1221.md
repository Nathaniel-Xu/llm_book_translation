On the circular stone platform, Zhao Yuanlai's mouth was agape, unable to speak for half a day, while Zhou Xianyang glanced uneasily at the center position, afraid that the pure and upright Pure Jun Zhenren and others would notice something amiss.

The originally conversing Pure Jun and others were indeed attracted by the two's strike, drawing their gaze over.

"Hehe, your Golden Origin Immortal Domain is indeed hiding dragons and tigers, these two are quite impressive." Feng Tian Xian Shi rarely spoke, and even more rarely offered praise.

The master of the Golden Origin Immortal Palace, Lu Chuan Feng, heard this and smiled, nodding his head without speaking, but Pure Jun Zhenren suddenly opened his mouth and said:

"One has a gravity law, the other has a mysterious physical body, their combat strength is indeed not bad, worth observing."

The Heavenly Star Venerable, who had been dozing off with his eyes closed, suddenly opened them wide, staring at Han Li and the others, thinking about whether to pull their respective sects into the Day and Night Alliance.

On the performance platform, the black and white light beams cancelled each other out, and the momentum gradually subsided.

Han Li's figure reappeared in an instant, and then simultaneously flashed, becoming blurry and unclear once more.

The surrounding crowd couldn't help but focus their attention on this performance platform, their eyes rapidly moving to follow Han Li's trail.

A loud "bang" sound echoed out, and Han Li's figure leapt into the air, diving down with a punch.

A white light condensed on his fist, transforming into a snow-white light pillar that shot down towards Chu Zhong below.

Chu Zhong's shoulders shrugged, and his spine suddenly protruded like a dragon's backbone, emitting a series of "popping" sounds, and then his figure sprang up, actually charging straight towards the white light pillar.

A strange symbol appeared on his forehead, and a dark light with a metallic sheen emerged, not dodging or avoiding, but instead using a head-butting motion to collide with the light pillar.

"Boom boom boom..."

A series of explosive sounds echoed out, and Chu Zhong's figure charged upwards, his body radiating hundreds of light points.

"Actually, he's also a Mysterious Body cultivator..." Han Li's brow furrowed, his figure pressing downwards.

The white light pillar between them shortened, and the distance between them rapidly decreased, finally colliding with a loud "boom".

The heaven and earth's energy surged again, and the two separated, the air filling with dust and smoke.

Before the dust settled, a black light screen began to expand, covering the entire performance platform, and a water-ink painting-like black mountain peak appeared in the air, its shadowy form floating in the distance.

Along with a low, muffled sound, black light beams shot down from the air, making the entire space feel heavy and oppressive.

The dust that had yet to settle was instantly pressed down by the gravity, and Han Li, standing on the stone platform, stumbled and almost fell.

The stone platform beneath him suddenly shattered, turning into a pile of rubble.

"This Chu Zhong elder is not only a Mysterious Body cultivator, but has also cultivated such a powerful Creative Domain, I think it's hopeless for Brother Han this time." Zhao Yuanlai looked at the situation on the performance platform, somewhat gloating.

"Zhao Mountain Lord, don't be too quick to judge, let's wait and see." Zhou Xianyang said.

He didn't know Han Li's true cultivation, only that it was definitely not weak, but limited by not being able to reveal his identity, and not being able to use his own techniques, facing Chu Zhong was indeed somewhat difficult.

The crowd around the platform cheered and applauded, the other performance platforms' battles entering a white-hot state, looking extremely lively.

The attention of the people on the circular stone platform was still focused on Han Li's "ugly" platform.

Han Li tried to lift his leg, but found that the surrounding space's gravity had increased at least a hundredfold, making even this small action extremely difficult.

"Brother Han, if you don't release your domain to counter mine, you'll definitely have no chance of winning." Chu Zhong floated in mid-air, his hands hanging down, speaking in a flat tone.

"Brother Chu, it's not that I'm arrogant, but I've actually only cultivated my physical body, and haven't touched upon the domain." Han Li replied, looking up at Chu Zhong.

"Even so, Brother Han, it's still better to admit defeat early." Chu Zhong's hands formed a seal, and he said.

As soon as he finished speaking, his seal was complete, and he raised his palm, striking down towards Han Li.

The water-ink painting-like black mountain peak in the air suddenly sank downwards, plummeting dozens of feet.

Han Li's face contorted in a silent scream, and he felt the surrounding space's gravity pressure increase by another tenfold, his body almost unable to withstand it.

"Crack crack crack..."

The sound of his bones and joints grinding under the pressure echoed in Han Li's ears.

He gritted his teeth, and suddenly let out a loud roar.

His fists clenched, and the nine hundred plus acupoints on his body lit up, the True Extreme membrane on his body also radiating a brilliant light.

The starlight from the True Extreme membrane created a small, enclosed space around him, repelling the surrounding black light beams.

Then, the acupoints on his legs lit up, and a powerful starlight burst forth, shooting out a brilliant light that resembled a fountain, propelling Han Li's figure into the air, charging towards Chu Zhong.

Although his power was great, under Chu Zhong's gravity law, his speed was reduced, and in the latter's eyes, it seemed somewhat laughable.

"Still not giving up?" Chu Zhong sneered, his figure flipping over, diving down.
Its two ape-like arms suddenly shook, and a loud "crackling" sound echoed through the air.

Han Li's hands quickly formed a seal, and his fists simultaneously pounded downwards.

The water-ink mountain peak behind him suddenly shook violently, and massive black stones detached from the mountain, transforming into a black meteor shower that howled as it descended.

"Rumble rumble..."

The air was in turmoil, and countless black stones fell, engulfing Han Li's figure.

A series of thunderous explosions echoed through the air, and Han Li's body not only didn't fall under the impact of the black stones, but instead, his fists shattered the stones into powder, and his entire body was like a white light arrow, shooting upwards.

A loud explosion echoed through the air.

Another massive black stone shattered, and Han Li's body pierced through it, immediately facing a figure that suddenly appeared in front of him.

The figure's fist was raised, and a black light burst forth from the acupoint on his arm, fiercely striking Han Li's chest. The force was so great that it tore through the air, creating rifts in the void.

Han Li was caught off guard, and only managed to cross his arms, holding them horizontally in front of his chest to block the attack.

Just as the black light enveloped Han Li's arms, the Xuanwu blood vessels in his body suddenly surged, and his arms immediately split open, revealing a series of black, turtle-shell-like markings.

A deafening explosion echoed through the air, and Han Li's body was like a falling meteor, crashing down from the sky, smashing through countless black stones, and slamming into the ground.

The already ruined martial arts stage collapsed, and a massive black hole, over a hundred zhang deep, opened up, with shocking fissures spreading to the surrounding stages.

Several cultivators from the Nine Yuan Sect quickly flew up to stop the spreading power, preventing the other stages from being affected.

"Good..." A shout of admiration suddenly echoed through the air.

The crowd erupted into cheers, all excited by the intense battle.

On the ring-shaped stone platform, Zhou Xianyang's expression was tense, and he kept glancing at the black hole.

"Now, Sect Master Zhou, don't you think my words were too early?" Zhao Yuanlai couldn't help but smile.

At the center of the platform, the Palace Master of the Golden Source Sect, LÃ¼ Chuanfeng, furrowed his brow, looking puzzled.

"Did you notice that the elder from the Xianyang Sect seems to have the Xuanwu blood vessels in his body?"

"It seems they're not very pure, otherwise, he wouldn't have been unable to withstand that blow." Tianxing Zunzhe seemed a bit disappointed.

"Not bad." Chun Jun Zhenren nodded in agreement.

The Phoenix Heavenly Envoy, however, was already looking away, his attention focused on another stage.

In his opinion, the outcome of this battle was already decided, and there was no need to waste any more attention on it.

Just as his gaze shifted away, the water-ink mountain peak suddenly shrunk, rapidly falling towards the ground, and embedded itself into the massive pit, sinking down.

A deafening explosion echoed through the air, and the entire square shook violently.

On the "ugly" stage, the dust settled, and Chu Zhong's figure landed on the top of the water-ink mountain peak, still hunched over, resembling a hunchbacked old ape.

The crowd saw this and knew that the outcome was already decided, and they all cheered for Chu Zhong.

The Nine Yuan Sect elder, who was hosting the event, waited for a moment, then flew up, intending to declare Chu Zhong the winner.

But just as he was about to do so, a sudden change occurred.

The water-ink mountain peak, which had been embedded in the ground, suddenly shook violently, and a burst of white light shot out from the gap between the mountain and the pit, illuminating the sky.

The entire square shook violently, and the water-ink mountain peak, which had seemed so heavy, began to slowly rise, flying out of the pit.

The crowd watched in awe as Han Li, with his hands raised to the sky, lifted the massive mountain peak, his body radiating an intense aura. The number of acupoints on his body had already surpassed a thousand.

"How is this possible?" Zhao Yuanlai's eyes widened in shock.

Zhou Xianyang was also trying to maintain a calm demeanor, pretending to have expected this.

The crowd erupted into cheers, like a tsunami.

Chu Zhong, standing on the mountain peak, changed his expression, squatting down and pressing his hands on the mountain, channeling his spiritual energy and law power into it.

The mountain peak, already weighing over a thousand jun, grew even heavier, and its gravity increased, causing it to fall towards the ground once more.

However, Han Li, who was under the mountain peak, seemed to have anticipated this, and had already activated the Da Li Jin Gang Jue, punching out a massive fist that tore through the void, creating a tunnel that Chu Zhong's law power couldn't interfere with.

Han Li's body flashed through the tunnel, and in the blink of an eye, he appeared on the mountain peak, his fingers raised, pointing at Chu Zhong.

He then punched out a massive fist, striking Chu Zhong with incredible force.
