The crisis back then was actually nothing much. Although Shi Kongyu was powerful, he was similarly suppressed in the Jilei Empty Realm and couldn't display much of his strength. His main goal was to disrupt Fellow Daoist Shi Kong's breakthrough. After succeeding with one strike, he immediately retreated and didn't pursue us to the death. As for outside help, we were imprisoned here and couldn't easily leave. We had basically no contact with the other forces in the Saint Realm. Shi Kongyu single-handedly dominated the Saint Realm, and the other forces were still trying to avoid us, let alone lend a helping hand." Daoist Crab smiled and spoke with a calm tone.

"I see." Han Li was silent for a moment before nodding with a smile.

"I still have some matters to attend to. Fellow Daoist Han, please feel free to do as you wish." Daoist Crab nodded slightly and turned to leave.

Han Li watched Daoist Crab's departing figure with a slight frown. The matters from back then, whether Daoist Crab or the two Soul Seizing Puppets knew the inside story, from the looks of Daoist Crab, even if he did know, he clearly wouldn't easily tell others. Asking Daoist Crab probably wouldn't yield any answers.

Wanting to understand the truth from back then, he could only slowly investigate elsewhere.

After pondering briefly, Han Li quickly walked outside to the main hall.

Inside the main hall stood quite a few people. Besides Daoist Crab, there were over twenty others, including Violet Spirit, Sha Xin, Madam Six Flowers, Shi Chuan Kong, Zhuo Ge, Xuan Yuan Xing, and even the Zhu siblings.

In an empty space on the other side of the great hall, a white stone platform was set up. 

At the top of the stone platform was a round magic formation several meters in size, emitting bursts of golden light. 

Powerful spatial fluctuations emanated from the formation, causing the space above the formation to ripple like water, forming a spinning vortex several meters in size.

"Fellow Daoist Han, you've arrived." Daoist Crab stood up to welcome him.

Seeing this, Sha Xin and the others also enthusiastically greeted Han Li.

Violet Spirit stood behind Sha Xin. Her bright eyes also looked over, sensing that the aura Han Li emitted was even more powerful and vast, his temperament more mature and steady. Her beautiful eyes couldn't help brightening.

"Fellow Daoist Han feels guilty for making everyone wait for him." Han Li cupped his hands and said.

"Not at all, Sha Xin and the others only just arrived. This transportation formation leads to the outside world. I will open it shortly. Fellow Daoist Han, if you have any matters to attend to, please handle them now." Daoist Crab glanced at Violet Spirit, his words carrying a hidden meaning.

Hearing this, Han Li's expression froze. 

After Daoist Crab said this, he pointed and a golden light entered Han Li's body, restoring the flow of Immortal Qi within him.

After doing all this, Daoist Crab stood up and walked over to the formation.

Sha Xin immediately followed. The two spoke in low voices, seemingly discussing the transportation matters.

Han Li was somewhat baffled by Daoist Crab's actions, but being able to circulate his Immortal Qi again was definitely a good thing.

He collected himself and walked over to Violet Spirit. With a wave of his hand, he set up a sound barrier and was about to speak when Violet Spirit stopped him with a wave.

"I only came here this time to see you off, don't overthink it." Violet Spirit smiled enchantingly and said.

"You plan to continue staying here?" Han Li's eyes flashed with surprise before glancing at Daoist Crab with sudden realization.

So Daoist Crab already knew Violet Spirit planned to stay, which was why he spoke the way he did earlier and even restored Han Li's Immortal Qi.

"The Heaven Destroyer Prison Technique you taught me, after researching it these years, I find it truly profound. The star power in the Jilei Empty Realm is dense, making it an ideal place to cultivate this body refinement technique. I plan to increase my strength here some more before going to the Devil Realm." Violet Spirit nodded and said.

"That's good. The Devil Realm is not very safe right now. This Jilei Empty Realm is actually safer. You should cultivate well here." Han Li stared at the stunning beauty before him for a long time before finally speaking, his voice unusually calm.

"I've also started cultivating the Divine Essence Technique you taught me." Violet Spirit's beautiful eyes were filled with determination as she continued.

"I knew you would definitely cultivate this technique." Han Li was silent upon hearing this, then sighed.

"I have decent talent in divine sense cultivation, no worse than you Han, I'm sure. Since you can cultivate this Divine Essence Technique, of course I can too." Violet Spirit blinked playfully.

"Since you plan to cultivate this technique, then do as you wish. But if any problems arise during cultivation, remember to contact me immediately." Han Li instructed.

"Okay." Violet Spirit nodded with a smile.

Han Li led Violet Spirit to the side, took out some special items from his Starry Sky Bracelet, and put some other things in.

"This bone bracelet looks a bit ugly, but it's a storage bracelet that can be used in the Jilei Empty Realm. It's quite practical. Since you've chosen to stay, I'll give this to you." Han Li then took off his Starry Sky Bracelet, lifted Violet Spirit's left hand, and put it on her.

"This item is too precious, I can't accept it. You should keep it for yourself." Violet Spirit was shocked and immediately tried to take off the bracelet.

"No need. I'm about to leave this place. Outside, this bracelet will be completely useless." Han Li stopped Violet Spirit's movements and transmitted with a smile.

"Right, I almost forgot." Violet Spirit was stunned, then laughed.

"The bracelet contains the latter nine layers of the Heaven Destroyer Prison Technique, as well as a Wheel Turning Hall mask. If you need to contact me in the future, you can use this item. In addition, there are some other things, all of which will be useful to you now." Han Li continued to explain.

Violet Spirit's eyes flashed with a hint of tears as she nodded lightly.

"When I'm not by your side, if you encounter any difficulties you can't resolve, don't stubbornly resist. Remember to seek help from Fellow Daoist Crab." Han Li reminded again.
After a long discussion off to the side, the two walked back.

Han Li's gaze shifted, looking towards Shi Chuankong.

Seeing this, Shi Chuankong stepped forward.

"Daoist friend Han, since entering the Jilin Void, I have relied on your help, and I am deeply grateful. This time I came, like Daoist friend Zi Ling, just to say goodbye to you. I don't plan to leave the Jilin Void for now." Shi Chuankong nodded at Zi Ling, looking very familiar, and then said to Han Li.

"Daoist friend Shi doesn't plan to leave either?" Han Li was slightly stunned, and couldn't help but touch his nose.

"Third brother is now untrustworthy, and my strength is still very weak. Instead of returning to the Night Sun Dynasty now and being bullied by others, I might as well stay here and cultivate. Besides, with your relationship, Daoist friend Han, I'm living quite comfortably here." Shi Chuankong said with a smile.

"That's good, then I'll leave Zi Ling in your care." Han Li nodded.

The Crab Daoist is now at odds with the Demon Master, and Shi Chuankong staying here, I don't know if it's voluntary or coerced.

Although he and Shi Chuankong are friends, his relationship with the Crab Daoist is deeper, and now that he has allied with him, these matters are not easy to ask about.

"Now Daoist friend Zi Ling is a big celebrity in Puppet City, where does she need me to look after her? These years, I have mostly relied on Daoist friend Zi Ling's care." Shi Chuankong laughed heartily.

"Daoist friend Shi is too kind. You are Brother Han's friend, so naturally you are also my friend, and since you are the Thirteenth Prince of the Night Sun Dynasty, there may be many things to rely on Daoist friend Shi after leaving the Jilin Void." Zi Ling said with a smile.

"Of course." Shi Chuankong said, patting his chest.

Seeing this, Han Li's heart was slightly relieved.

This way, whether Zi Ling is in the Jilin Void or in the Demon Realm in the future, there will be someone to look after her.

"After I leave, you take care of yourself." Han Li's lips moved slightly, transmitting a message to Zi Ling.

"Take care." Zi Ling transmitted back.

"Daoist friend Han, I heard from Daoist friend Zi Ling that you will soon return to the Immortal Realm after leaving the Jilin Void. I am staying here and cannot help you. Speaking of which, the rewards I promised you before, I have hardly fulfilled any of them, which makes me ashamed." Shi Chuankong sighed and said.

"Daoist friend Shi is too kind. You helped me find Zi Ling, which is enough. I will handle the other things myself." Han Li waved his hand.

Hearing this, Shi Chuankong's face looked slightly better.

"By the way, besides you two, are all the other people here going to be sent back to the Saint Realm?" Han Li glanced at the others and transmitted a message.

"Yes. Daoist friend Crab seems to have some plan." Zi Ling said.

Han Li nodded slowly upon hearing this.

After chatting for a while, Crab Daoist seemed to be ready and called Han Li over.

Han Li, Sha Xin and others quickly boarded the transmission formation.

But the Crab Daoist did not step on it. He chanted in his mouth, bent his finger and pointed.

The transmission formation burst out dazzling golden-white light, and the speed of the space vortex above it suddenly increased. A dark space passage soon emerged.

A huge space suction force emanated from the space passage, enveloping Han Li and others.

Han Li looked up at Zi Ling, their eyes meeting.

In the next moment, Han Li and others disappeared into the space passage with a "swoosh" sound.

Zi Ling's body trembled slightly, her beautiful eyes staring blankly at the place where the figure disappeared, as if she was in a daze.

...

Above a barren forest in the Demon Realm, a dazzling white light suddenly appeared out of thin air and quickly expanded, forming a white light ball dozens of meters in size in the blink of an eye.

The space inside the light ball rolled violently. After a few breaths, a cracking sound was heard, and a black space door opened.

In the next moment, more than twenty figures flew out of the space door one by one. After the initial panic, everyone quickly stabilized their figures. They were Han Li, Sha Xin and others.

Han Li felt the spiritual energy of the surrounding world and the disappeared space pressure, revealing a relieved look on his face. The others were the same.

Han Li took a deep breath and quickly calmed down. His divine sense spread out, exploring the surrounding terrain and confirming his location.

After a few breaths, his eyebrows moved, as if he had discovered something.

"Daoist friend Han, I am entrusted by my master and have some things to do. I will take my leave now. We will meet again later." Sha Xin bowed slightly to Han Li, then without waiting for Han Li to reply, she left with the others in a hurry.

Seeing this, Han Li's eyes flashed.

He didn't stay here any longer. Turning into a streak of cyan rainbow light, he shot towards the distance, disappearing without a trace in the blink of an eye.
