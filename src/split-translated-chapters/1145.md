Taking advantage of the opportunity, Han Li's eyes narrowed, and his internal Tian Sha Zhen Yu Gong was fully activated, stirring up his true spirit bloodline.

A dark light flashed around him, and a layer of demonic energy surged forth.

Immediately, a silver lightning bolt burst forth from the demonic energy, and a massive figure emerged from the rolling mist.

It was a giant flying bird, over a hundred feet long, with three different giant bird heads. The central head was that of a Lei Peng, with silver electric threads wrapped around its skull. The left and right heads were those of a Tian Feng and a Qing Luan, respectively, with flames and swift winds swirling around them.

The three-headed bird's body was covered in blue and red feathers, with seven red flames swirling around its tail. Its two massive silver claws gleamed with a sharp, knife-like edge, and its body was surrounded by a halo of silver lightning.

As the bird spread its wings, two whirlwinds erupted beneath, sending two massive waves of energy crashing through the air. The bird's tail feathers burst forth with red flames, and its body was surrounded by a frenzy of silver lightning.

In an instant, the bird's body vanished from the white light disk, reappearing tens of thousands of miles away.

This was, of course, Han Li, who had fused his Tian Sha Zhen Yu Gong with the true spirit bloodline of the Lei Peng, transforming into a demonic creature.

"Ah, he's escaped..." Chi Meng frowned, sensing something amiss.

Miao Fa Xian Zun saw this and didn't bother to continue fighting, his body dissolving into a flurry of snowflakes that dispersed into the air.

"Heh, it seems he has some real skills! This is interesting, very interesting!" Chi Meng's mouth curled into a smile, and she didn't seem too concerned.

With a light tap of her foot, the crimson clouds beneath her erupted into a blaze of fire, and she chased after Han Li at incredible speed.

Han Li was fleeing for his life, his speed far surpassing that of ordinary cultivators, and even rivaling that of the Lei Zhen technique. Moreover, his speed was more sustainable, making him nearly unbeatable in a chase.

However, before long, the air in front of him began to distort, and a fierce wind picked up, causing the temperature to drop. The sky darkened, and a thick layer of white fog rolled in, shrouding the area in a freezing mist.

Han Li's three-headed bird form charged into the storm, but the winds were too strong, and his speed was greatly reduced.

He was caught off guard by the sheer scale of Chi Meng's spiritual domain, which seemed to be capable of manipulating the very fabric of reality.

Just as Han Li was about to be trapped, he unleashed a burst of energy from his true spirit and immortal spirit, letting out a sharp cry.

The three heads of the bird opened their mouths, and a blue whirlwind, a silver lightning bolt, and a red flame erupted forth, merging into a dazzling rainbow-colored beam of light that shot forward.

The beam pierced through the storm, creating a massive opening in the fog, and Han Li's bird form flew through it, emerging on the other side.

As he broke through the storm, Han Li's vision expanded, and he saw that the landscape had transformed into a winter wonderland, with snow-covered mountains stretching as far as the eye could see.

"Han Li, you're just a small-time Tai Yi realm cultivator, but you have quite a few tricks up your sleeve. Where will you run now?" Miao Fa Xian Zun's voice echoed through the air once more.

Before Han Li could even react, a faint shadow began to coalesce in front of him, stretching from the ground to the sky.

Han Li's eyes widened as he realized it was the same ice crystal wall that had blocked him earlier. His heart racing, he activated his true mantra, and his speed increased by a factor of two.

The ice crystal wall began to spread a layer of frost, which crystallized into solid ice in an instant, covering half of the wall.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he dove towards the lower half of the wall, which was still unfrozen.

However, the frost was too fast, and the wall was about to be completely sealed.

Just as all hope seemed lost, the Lei Peng's eyes flashed with silver lightning, and two silver lightning balls shot out from its claws, striking the base of the ice crystal wall.

The resulting explosion shattered the wall, creating a massive opening that Han Li flew through, his wings beating fiercely as he soared into the sky and disappeared into the distance.
"How could this be..." Miao Fa Xian Zun's expression changed, and a flash of anger crossed her face.

At this moment, she suddenly discovered that Chi Meng, who had been chasing her, was nowhere to be seen.

Han Li burst out of the ice crystal city wall, but his mind was still on high alert, and the True Speech Treasure Wheel in his body continued to reverse, causing his divine spirit power, true spirit power, and law power to simultaneously and violently deplete.

Under the combined effect of these three forces, the distance between him and Miao Fa Xian Zun was slowly increasing.

But before he could even feel a sense of relief, a sudden change occurred in the void ahead!

A blinding sunbeam suddenly refracted forward, bursting into a dazzling white light in the void, and a vibrant red dress appeared, wrapped around a slender figure.

Han Li's three true spirit heads couldn't withstand the intense light, and he involuntarily narrowed his eyes.

The next moment, a series of loud, resonant sounds like the Yellow Bell and the Great Lyre echoed through the air, and a massive, semi-transparent light shield descended from the sky, enveloping Han Li's massive body and pressing him towards the ground.

Han Li's wings flapped wildly, and his body suddenly shot forward, colliding with the semi-transparent light shield.

A low, humming sound echoed through the air, and the light shield shook violently, with a layer of dense, glowing runes appearing on its surface, emitting a series of strange, pulsating waves that struck Han Li, causing his divine spirit to shudder and his body to fall to the ground.

After falling, Han Li's body flashed with light, and he returned to his human form.

The semi-transparent light shield that had enveloped him also flashed with light, rapidly shrinking to the size of a small house.

Han Li looked around, seeing that the semi-transparent light shield was like an upside-down bowl, with countless runes etched into its surface, covering the entire shield.

On top of the shield, eight red crystal fire dragons were coiled, their bodies surrounded by swirling clouds of flame, all with their heads facing outward, as if ready to strike.

Han Li could sense the powerful fire attribute law power emanating from the dragons, and he guessed that this object was likely a high-grade divine artifact.

After the semi-transparent light shield had restrained Han Li, Chi Meng, dressed in a red skirt, flew down from the sky.

"Tsk, tsk, you look quite ordinary, don't you? You've been running away the whole time, and you don't even know how to deal with the waste from the Jin Yuan Xian Palace. They actually let you get away, and now you're trying to escape again? You're really losing face for the Heavenly Court."

Han Li ignored her words, and a purple light flashed in his eyes as he activated his Spirit Eye divine ability, carefully examining the divine artifact in search of any weaknesses that could help him escape.

"I'm telling you, don't waste your energy, this Nine Dragon Divine Fire Shield is a genuine fourth-grade divine artifact. Even a Mahayana cultivator would find it hard to escape, let alone you, a mere Taiyi cultivator. Why bother trying to escape? You might as well just surrender and avoid some unnecessary suffering."

Han Li examined the shield and found that it was surrounded by a powerful law power, with no weaknesses to be found.

At this moment, Miao Fa Xian Zun arrived, and upon seeing the scene before her, her brow furrowed.

"Hey, you're too late, this person is already my captive," Chi Meng said with a smile.

"Is that so? I don't see him wearing a collar or being bound by you. If you're saying that you've only managed to restrain him, then I've already done that before," Miao Fa Xian Zun said, her face expressionless, as she glared at Chi Meng.

"You and I can't settle this, so why don't we finish the fight we started earlier and see who comes out on top? That way, we can decide what to do with him."

"Too much nonsense!" Miao Fa Xian Zun said, her body flashing forward as she flew into the sky.

Chi Meng was about to chase after her, but she suddenly seemed to remember something, and turned to Han Li, saying, "Don't think about trying to escape or play any tricks, or you might end up losing your life. I'm not as cruel as Miao Fa, and I don't want you to die just yet."

After finishing her words, she flew off into the sky.

The two women disappeared into the clouds, and the air was filled with an intense, oppressive energy, as if the very heavens themselves were being torn apart.

The sky was divided into two halves, with one side a deep, fiery red, and the other a cold, snowy white.

Han Li listened to the thunderous sounds above, but he didn't have time to look.

He composed himself and reached for the Xuan Tian Gourd at his waist, pouring out its contents and pointing the mouth of the gourd at the bottom of the Nine Dragon Divine Fire Shield, where it touched the ground.
