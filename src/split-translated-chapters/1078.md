After Han Li and the others left, only Lei Yu Ce and Su Xun Si remained.

For some reason, Jin Liu's eyes followed Han Li's figure disappearing into the distance, and his heart felt a slight relaxation, as if the tension in his nerves had been released.

Regarding this person who he couldn't see through, no matter how he appeared on the surface, Jin Liu's vigilance and guard never wavered.

The Lan Yuan Zi siblings exchanged a glance, also secretly letting out a sigh of relief.

Although they were originally ordered to pursue and kill Han Li, after their encounter, they discovered that this opponent was more difficult to deal with than they had imagined. If they had a choice, they would rather not have met him.

"Now, what should we do?" Su Xun Si looked at the remaining people and asked.

"Wait a moment, Su Xianzi."

Lei Yu Ce said, his wrist twisting, and a metal disk with many symbols and markings appeared in his palm. He held it with one hand and pressed down on it with the other, operating it with a series of hand seals.

A moment later, the disk lit up with a blurry glow, and inside, a small flame the size of a thumb rose up, as if being pulled by an invisible force, slightly shifting to one side.

Seeing this, including Su Xun Si, everyone was slightly startled, but Jin Liu's eyes lit up.

Lei Yu Ce followed the direction of the flame, then flipped his palm, putting away the disk, and pointed in the direction the flame had shifted.

"We'll go this way."

"Lei Dao You, what is this thing?" Su Xun Si asked, furrowing her brow.

Lei Yu Ce hesitated for a moment before explaining, "It's a small treasure that can slightly connect with the Sui Yue Shen Deng, and following its direction will definitely not be wrong."

"So, does that mean that the direction Stone Dao You took was incorrect?" Su Xun Si asked, looking at the direction Lei Yu Ce was pointing, which was quite far from Han Li's.

"Do you remember the fork in the road when we first entered the secret realm?" Lei Yu Ce asked, changing the subject.

"Your meaning is... different paths, same destination?" Su Xun Si asked back.

"Whether Stone Dao You's path is correct or not, I don't know, but perhaps the destination we finally reach will be the same." Lei Yu Ce nodded, saying so.

Su Xun Si heard this, looked at Lei Yu Ce, and nodded thoughtfully.

"We shouldn't delay, since we have a direction, let's set off." Wen Zhong reminded.

...

In the golden desert, aside from the interference with his divine sense, Han Li's flying speed was also suppressed, making him feel somewhat unaccustomed.

"Xiong Shan Dao You, no matter what your purpose is for following me, I'll remind you that you shouldn't do anything unnecessary. I don't want to kill you again." Han Li glanced at Xiong Shan, who was closely following him, and said.

"Han Dao You, don't blame me, this encounter is truly a play of fate. If it weren't for Qi Mo Zi's sudden summons, I would either be on duty in the Xian prison or closed up in my cave, and I wouldn't have come out until I reached the Tai Yi late stage." Xiong Shan hastily explained.

"Oh, why did you want to reach the Tai Yi late stage?" Han Li raised an eyebrow, asking.

"I originally thought that with the support of the Xian palace, I could reach the Tai Yi late stage before you, and then come find you to settle the score from back then. But after seeing you, I lost that heart, and I'm afraid I'll never have the chance again." Xiong Shan sighed, his face bitter.

"Let's not talk about other things, how did you recognize my identity?" Han Li stared at Xiong Shan, asking.

"Didn't you, Han Dao You, just recently had a confrontation with Qi Mo Zi?" Xiong Shan asked back.

"That's right. So, does that mean that Qi Mo Zi left some mark on me during our previous encounter?" Han Li's heart moved, asking.

"Qi Mo Zi knew that you, Han Dao You, were skilled in changing your identity with the wheel of reincarnation mask, so he decided that the next time he encountered you, he would leave a mark on you, making it easier to track you down afterwards." Xiong Shan nodded, saying.

"Xiong Dao You, you'd better explain clearly, what kind of mark is it that even I couldn't detect?" Han Li asked, puzzled.

"This mark won't have any spiritual energy fluctuations, and can't be tracked from a distance. Only when you're extremely close can you sense it through a small seal." Xiong Shan said, taking out a small, willow-leaf-sized jade pendant and presenting it to Han Li.

Han Li took the pendant, discovering that it didn't have any unusual glow or fluctuations, only a burning sensation emanating from it, and he understood.

"Since you discovered my identity, shouldn't you be afraid of me, rather than following me?" Han Li asked, putting the pendant away.

"This is because... I think that following you will be safer, and maybe I can gain some benefits that you wouldn't notice. Second, I'm thinking that if I meet Qi Mo Zi again, he'll see that I'm following you, and I'll have fulfilled my duty." Xiong Shan hesitated, saying so.

"Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you again?" Han Li's eyes narrowed, asking.

"You've already killed me once, and all the enmity should be wiped clean. This time, I didn't take the initiative to become your enemy, and I believe that you, sir, distinguish between gratitude and resentment, and won't kill an innocent person. If I take a step back, dying at your hands is still my own choice, and it's better than dying in this tower without knowing why." Xiong Shan's back was drenched in cold sweat, but he forced himself to remain calm.
"Then please, Brother Xiongshan, remember what you said just now. If I find even a hint of abnormal behavior from you, don't blame me for being heartless." Han Li's mouth curved into a cold smile.

Actually, if it were any other time, he would never have allowed Xiongshan to follow him like this. If someone were to follow him like this, he would have killed them on the spot without hesitation. But now, with Qimozi's whereabouts unknown, he decided to let Xiongshan follow him, to see if he had any hidden plans or schemes, and to use this opportunity to lure Qimozi out and eliminate him once and for all.

"Brother Han, you only need to move your little finger, and you can kill me on the spot. I wouldn't do anything so foolish." Xiongshan quickly waved his hand.

Just as they were speaking, Jiao San and Huo San caught up from behind.

"Brother Han, can you tell us clearly what you found over there?" Jiao San asked directly.

"Yes, although your choices are usually not wrong, if you could let us know, we could also have a bottom line, and if we encounter any unexpected situations, we could also have a way to respond." Huo San chimed in.

"I just sensed a familiar yet unfamiliar aura, so I wanted to go take a look. You all didn't need to follow me." Han Li replied nonchalantly.

"Alright, you at least have a direction, maybe it's the right path after all." Jiao San thought for a moment before saying.

And so, the group of people followed Han Li's lead, flying rapidly through the air.

As they flew over the desert, they could see giant golden skeletons buried in the sand from time to time.

However, the group only scanned the area with their divine sense, and finding nothing out of the ordinary, they didn't pay much attention.

"Over there..."

After flying for about two hours, Han Li saw a blurry outline appear at the edge of his vision, reflecting a dazzling golden light, which seemed to be a magnificent palace building.

The aura he had sensed earlier was now becoming more and more distinct.

Huo San and Jiao San's spirits were lifted.

The group flew closer, and after a hundred miles, they finally saw clearly that it was a grand hall made of golden sand, with giant golden curved horns used for decoration, which were clearly the remains of some exotic beast's skeleton.

On the roof of the golden hall, a group of young men in golden robes were lying along the ridge, each holding a golden skull.

Their faces were quite handsome, but their expressions were somewhat lazy, and they were tossing the skulls back and forth with a look of boredom.

The skulls were much larger than ordinary human skulls, and seemed to be from some exotic tribe. However, they had been played with so much that their surfaces had become very smooth.

One of the young men tossed the skull again, and then stood up, looking far away at Han Li and the others, his eyes narrowing slightly as he licked his lips.

At this moment, his chest suddenly moved, and a golden lizard the size of a palm emerged from his collar, standing on his shoulder, also looking in their direction.

"Indeed..." Han Li's eyes condensed, and his face turned serious.

"Brother Han, do you know this person?" Jiao San asked.

"It's not wrong to say that I know him. That's the infamous Jin Xian." Han Li nodded.

"What... I sensed that his aura has already reached the Da Luo realm, and this kind of Jin Xian's strength is not something that ordinary Da Luo cultivators can match. This is going to be trouble." Huo San exclaimed.

"Ah, Brother Han, I knew I shouldn't have followed you." Xiongshan sighed, lamenting his decision.

Jiao San didn't say anything, but his eyes flickered, as if he was thinking of a way to deal with the situation.

Before Han Li could say anything, the young man had already flashed to a distance of several hundred feet, floating in mid-air, examining the group with interest.

Han Li and the others immediately became cautious, on high alert.

"You don't need to be so tense, I won't kill you immediately..." The young man suddenly smiled, saying.

After that, he took the golden lizard from his shoulder, holding it high, and continued, "I've been stuck in prison for too long, and it's been 10,000 years since I've had any fun. Since you're here, you can stay and keep me company."

As soon as he finished speaking, he tossed the golden lizard, and a burst of sound shook the air.

The golden lizard flew out like a golden arrow, shooting straight at Jiao San's face.

Jiao San didn't seem to move, but a dark red glow appeared in front of him, forming an invisible shield.

The golden lizard hit the shield, and the shield rippled like water, creating a deep impression. The distance between the lizard and Jiao San's brow was only a few inches.

But then, the shield suddenly shook, and a dark red glow burst out, bouncing the lizard back.

Just as this happened, Han Li shouted, "Be careful..."
