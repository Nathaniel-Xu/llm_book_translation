“Zhilalala……”

A burst of dazzling electric light flashed on the Qingtian Cloud Sword, and Han Li, who was originally tens of thousands of miles away, suddenly appeared in an instant, grasping the sword without hesitation, and swept it across.

“Hsss……”

A soft sound echoed, and the straw man's head flew high into the air, with a large amount of dark golden blood spraying out.

Han Li's body flashed rapidly, and he caught the head in mid-air, with a flash of electric light in his hand, transforming into a golden electric cage, enveloping it completely.

Dong Li Hu and Zi Shu wanted to rescue him again, but it was too late.

Han Li sneered and looked at the head in his hand, which had already returned to its original appearance, but was covered in blood, looking extremely pitiful.

The headless corpse on the other side was no longer in the shape of a straw man, with four blood holes on its left arm and chest, in the same position as Han Li's wounds.

“Meng Yuan fellow, isn't it? Your curse law is indeed not easy to use, and it's actually a wound-for-wound exchange. No wonder you could silently severely injure me, but didn't dare to directly shatter my heart vein or blow my head apart.” Han Li laughed.

As he spoke, his wounds began to heal, and eventually fully recovered.

The head Han Li was holding, however, couldn't laugh at all.

“Wound-for-wound, fellow, you underestimated my curse law. If I had a bit more time, it would be a life-for-life exchange. But since I've lost, I have nothing to say.” Meng Yuan's expression was still calm, but his heart was seething with anger.

Just a step away from victory... it was all because of Dong Li Hu's foolishness.

“Your law is indeed strange, and if it were an ordinary day, I might have spared your life to study it. But today, I really can't afford to let you off, so I'll just send you on your way.” Han Li sneered.

Regarding this strange curse law, he was indeed curious, but in the current situation, if he left Meng Yuan alive, who knows what kind of trouble he might cause? He didn't want to take that risk.

“Han Li, I curse you……” Meng Yuan began to curse loudly.

“I don't mind.” Han Li replied calmly.

……

Just as the Demon Lord and others were being blocked by the Hidden Ming Dao Zu and Chen Ruoyan, the Wheel of Rebirth Hall Master did not surrender.

His body flashed with a dark red light, and his fists were clenched and pushed outwards.

A powerful Wheel of Rebirth law burst forth, fiercely attacking the surrounding light shield.

The four-color light shield shook violently, and Li Yuanji's body also shook violently.

Gu Huojin saw this and, with a calm expression, pinched a seal with one hand.

The golden giant palm struck down again, directly merging with the four-color light shield.

A palm-print symbol appeared on the top of the light shield, and the four-color light shield immediately added a new color, its power increasing greatly, becoming thicker by several times.

This joint confinement technique, known as the Thirty-Three Heaven Locking Array, was an ancient and mysterious technique of the Heavenly Court, requiring the presence of a Dao Zu to activate. It could combine different law forces to form a confinement space.

Moreover, the more law forces combined, the greater the power of the Thirty-Three Heaven Locking Array. Legend had it that this technique could combine thirty-three different laws, with enough power to lock down the entire True Immortal Realm.

However, the more laws combined, the greater the difficulty. Gu Huojin had taught this technique to some of the Dao Zu serving the Heavenly Court, and most of them could only use it with four people working together.

The palm-print symbol on the light shield flashed, and a golden wave pattern spread out from it, rippling within the light shield.

The Wheel of Rebirth Hall Master was completely unable to move, and even the dark red light around him had stopped.

Li Yuanji and the others, however, did not relax, continuing to exert their full strength.

The five-law fusion of the Thirty-Three Heaven Locking Array far exceeded their control.

Gu Huojin's right hand grasped at the air, and a golden light shot out, entering the light shield and the Wheel of Rebirth Hall Master's body. It quickly flew out again.

The golden light contained a silver talisman, which flew out and landed in Gu Huojin's hand.

The talisman was covered in intricate silver patterns, with a complex and mysterious space law force emanating from it. In the center, a ancient-style "Ding" character was written.

The Demon Lord, watching from a distance, revealed a hint of surprise in his eyes.

“Space fixation talisman, no wonder Shi Kong Yu was able to break through my Heavenly Court's heavy restrictions and directly open a space channel here. You came to participate in the Bodhi feast, and your true intention was this. But unfortunately, you overestimated your strength, coming to my Heavenly Court alone, and now you won't be able to leave alive.” Gu Huojin looked at the Wheel of Rebirth Hall Master and said calmly.

The Wheel of Rebirth Hall Master was being suppressed by the four Dao Zu, unable to speak, and naturally couldn't respond to Gu Huojin's question.

“Thank you, four of you, for bringing him down. Seal him away.” Gu Huojin crushed the talisman and waved his hand at Li Yuanji and the others.

Li Yuanji acknowledged, and the four of them, along with the five-color light shield, flew away.

The nearby Heavenly Court personnel erupted in excited cheers, as the Wheel of Rebirth Hall Master was the Heavenly Court's greatest enemy, and they had finally captured him after countless years of pursuit.

With him in hand, the Wheel of Rebirth Hall was no longer a concern.

And the Demon Domain and the Barbarian True Spirit, who had clearly been working together with the Wheel of Rebirth Hall Master, would suffer a great blow to their morale.

The three Celestial True Lords, watching from the side, shook their heads in unison.
Cang Wu Zhen Jun's eyes flickered as he thought to himself, "Although it's to bring the spatial locator to Yao Chi, it's not right to come alone. Whether it's ancient or modern, it's not good to be with someone like Guo Jin. It seems that the rumors about the Lord of the Revival Hall are exaggerated, and it's not that impressive after all."

At this moment, the Lord of the Revival Hall was captured, and it seemed that the Heavenly Court had the upper hand in this battle. Perhaps it was time to take sides.

The other two people's eyes also flickered, seemingly considering the same thing.

Those who could attend the Bodhi banquet in Yao Chi were all people who had lived for countless tens of thousands of years, and many people in Yao Chi were thinking the same as Cang Wu Zhen Jun, looking at the Heavenly Court's people with more and more gazes.

Guo Jin, who was sensitive to the changes in the atmosphere of Yao Chi, smiled slightly and turned to look at the Demon Lord and others, about to say something.

But suddenly, a sudden change occurred!

Two loud explosions sounded, followed by two mournful cries, and a massive wave of energy surged forward, causing Guo Jin's body to stumble.

He quickly stabilized his body and turned around, his pupils shrinking to a pinpoint.

A huge black claw, the size of a house, appeared in front of him, with five long, scythe-like nails flashing with dark light, as if they could pierce through everything, and stabbed towards Guo Jin's head.

The claw was surrounded by a dark aura, emitting an evil and malevolent energy, as if it was a resentment that had been buried in the depths of the underworld for thousands of years, finally emerging to kill everyone in the world and drag them down to the underworld.

Behind the claw, the Lord of the Revival Hall, who was supposed to be imprisoned, had somehow escaped.

Further behind, the White Cloud Dao Zu and the dwarf old man were cut in half, lying in a pool of blood, although they had not fallen, they had temporarily lost their ability to move.

Li Yuanji and Chi Rong's figures had disappeared without a trace.

Guo Jin's eyebrows furrowed, and he waved his sleeve.

His long robe was also a magical artifact, and the sleeve puffed up in the wind, instantly transforming into a layer of golden light, blocking in front of him.

A strange sound echoed, and the golden light screen shook violently, the black claw piercing into the light screen for nearly half the distance, before finally stopping.

At this moment, a red flame burst forth from behind Guo Jin, striking his back.

The flame was surrounded by a fierce, crimson fire, with countless red lines forming a pattern, emitting a terrifying, high-temperature energy that melted the surrounding air.

The red light enveloped everything, turning the surroundings into a sea of fire.

A loud explosion sounded, and the Yao Chi area was instantly engulfed in flames.

Behind the red flame, Chi Rong's figure flashed out.

At the same time, Guo Jin's surroundings suddenly produced a "hiss" sound, and countless golden light threads appeared, each containing a powerful golden law fluctuation.

The surrounding sea of fire was instantly cut off, and the high temperature in the air was also cut off, the Yao Chi area's unbearable heat disappearing instantly.

The golden light threads shot down, stabbing towards Guo Jin.

Among the countless golden lights, Li Yuanji's figure also appeared.

Guo Jin's face sank, but before he could react, the red flame and the golden light threads simultaneously struck his body, engulfing him.

"Supreme!" The fallen White Cloud Dao Zu and the dwarf old man exclaimed.

The several Dao Zu who were blocking the Demon Domain and the Savage Ancient Spirit were also shocked, but everything happened too quickly, they couldn't react in time.

"What's going on, Li Yuanji and Chi Rong have defected to the Lord of the Revival Hall!" Cang Wu Zhen Jun and the others were shocked, their eyes wide with disbelief.

The flames and golden light enveloped Guo Jin's body.

But the expected earth-shattering explosion didn't occur, the red flame and golden light threads suddenly stopped, the surrounding air, the flashing lights, and the flames, all froze in place. Everything seemed extremely strange.

The Lord of the Revival Hall looked at the scene before him, his face changing, and he quickly retreated.

Li Yuanji and Chi Rong also flew back, seemingly avoiding something.

In the next moment, a blue light appeared in the air, and a massive, icy law fluctuation descended from the sky, the Yao Chi area's heat instantly disappearing, and the air was frozen.

The Lord of the Revival Hall and the other two were enveloped by the icy law fluctuation, their bodies momentarily frozen.

A figure appeared in the air, and the Snow-robed man who had worked with Chen Ruyan to resist the Savage Ancient Spirit appeared, his sleeve waving.

The blue light in the sky flashed, and countless blue ice cones condensed, shooting down with a piercing sound, striking the three people.

Each ice cone emitted a powerful, icy law fluctuation, and the air was filled with ice crystals, instantly freezing everything.

The sound of the ice cones echoed, and hundreds of law fluctuations shot down, striking the Lord of the Revival Hall and the other two.

The nearby Heavenly Court's hundred or so Da Luo existences finally seized the opportunity to attack the three people.

The Lord of the Revival Hall snorted, and without entangling with them, his body flashed and disappeared, reappearing above the Demon Domain's army.

Li Yuanji and Chi Rong saw the Lord of the Revival Hall leave, and they didn't stay behind, flying towards the Lord of the Revival Hall.
