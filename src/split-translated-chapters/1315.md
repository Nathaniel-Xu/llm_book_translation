Several patrons, please take a seat and enjoy the performance, don't disturb everyone's atmosphere. A nearby shop assistant walked over and advised.

"We've entered your wine shop, paid for the wine, and are the masters, we can do whatever we want, get out of our way." Another rascal jumped out, grabbed the shop assistant's clothes, and shouted with a skewed mouth.

"The patrons are also reasonable, but you're causing a commotion, scaring off all the customers, how can our wine shop do business? You appear to be outsiders, our wine shop's owner is the city's Jin Daguang, you should think carefully, offending our owner is not a good thing." The shop assistant was not afraid, speaking slowly and calmly.

The rascals all looked at the young man in luxurious clothes.

"Jin Daguang? Is that the Jin Fugui guy? He's just a small administrator in my Jinlong Gang, daring to call himself a high-ranking official in front of me." The young man sneered, still holding onto the green-clothed girl, as if holding onto a small white rabbit.

"Are you people from the Jinlong Gang?" The shop assistant's face showed a hint of panic.

"Are you blind? This is the Jinlong Gang's leader's son." The rascal holding the shop assistant's clothes used force to throw him to the ground.

The shop assistant was stunned, lying on the ground, not daring to get up, his entire body trembling.

The young man looked at the green-clothed girl, his Adam's apple rolling.

He had seen many women, but a delicate and tender beauty like this was rare.

"Cough! Get everyone else out." The young man growled.

The other patrons in the wine shop immediately changed color, not needing to be told, they quickly fled, leaving only Han Li and Ziling in the distance.

"You two don't want to look for trouble, hurry up and leave." A rascal shouted at the two.

Ziling had transformed into an ordinary-looking woman, not drawing the attention of the rascals.

Han Li's eyes were slightly cold, having just listened to the storytelling, reminding him of a distant memory, and he seemed to have gained some understanding, but was interrupted by these people.

"Disappointing." He lightly snorted, flicking his finger at the chopstick holder on the table.

The chopstick holder slightly moved, then returned to its original state.

The rascals' hands suddenly sprayed blood, each person's wrist having a chopstick embedded, piercing through.

"Ah ah ah!" The rascals only reacted now, holding their wrists and screaming.

The young man in luxurious clothes was the same, his wrist pierced by the chopstick, releasing the green-clothed girl.

The girl stared blankly at the scene, then quickly ran to the storyteller's side, helping him up.

"Let's go." Han Li stood up, taking out a small silver ingot and placing it on the table, walking downstairs.

Ziling smiled slightly, following.

The storyteller and his grandson were afraid of the young man and his companions seeking revenge, quickly following downstairs.

The young man and his companions were in extreme pain, not stopping the two.

"Benefactor, please wait." Han Li and Ziling had just exited the wine shop when the storyteller and his grandson caught up.

Han Li's face moved, stopping in his tracks.

"Thank you, benefactor, for your help today, if Xiaocui fell into those people's hands, she would only have one road to death." The storyteller bowed to Han Li in gratitude.

The green-clothed girl "thudded" to the ground, also kowtowing to Han Li in thanks.

Han Li was about to let the two up, but his face suddenly moved, a hint of unusual color flashing in his eyes.

"Brother Han?" Ziling asked softly.

"It was just a small matter, you two don't need to be so polite." Han Li's expression immediately returned to normal, waving his sleeve, a formless force lifting the two people's bodies.

The two people looked at Han Li with a gaze of reverence.

"Those people seem to have a powerful backing, you two should leave quickly, I can only save you once, not twice." Han Li said.

"Those people are from the Jinlong Gang, the Jinlong Gang's power is throughout the entire Iron State, if they want to seek revenge, where can we escape to?" The storyteller's face showed a hint of despair.

"Your accents are different from the people of Yushan City, you should be from elsewhere, where is your hometown?" Han Li asked.

"I and my grandfather are from Qingzhou, due to a famine in our hometown, we fled to this place." The green-clothed girl said.

"Qingzhou? Is it a place with two large rivers running parallel?" Han Li's eyebrows moved, asking.

"Yes." The green-clothed girl hesitated, nodding.

"Where is your hometown in Qingzhou, tell me in detail, and also describe the environment around your residence." Han Li's eyes narrowed, asking.

The green-clothed girl and the storyteller exchanged a glance, hesitating for a moment before carefully telling Han Li about their hometown and the environment around their residence.
"So that's the thatched cottage with the big willow tree at the entrance, that's your home," Han Li said with a light smile.

The blue-clothed girl and the old storyteller were taken aback, they had just described their situation, but hadn't mentioned the willow tree in front of the door, how did this person know about it?

"Let's go, I'll take you home," Han Li said with a flick of his sleeve, a burst of golden light enveloped the two, and then dimmed slightly.

The two people's eyes were suddenly filled with golden light, their bodies felt extremely light, as if they were floating in mid-air.

The next moment, they found themselves standing on solid ground, the golden light around them disappeared, and their vision cleared.

But the surroundings had changed, they were no longer in Yushan City, but in a small village by a lake.

Han Li and Ziling were nowhere to be seen.

In front of them, not far away, were three thatched cottages, with a big willow tree in front of the door, its leaves swaying in the wind.

"This is our hometown..." The blue-clothed girl and the old storyteller stared in shock, rubbing their eyes, not daring to believe what they were seeing.

"It seems that the famine in your hometown has passed, here's some silver, you can live a good life in your hometown from now on," Han Li's voice came from above, and then a silver ingot fell from the sky into the old man's hand.

"Thank you, immortal, for your help, my grandson and I will definitely build a long-life altar for you, and worship you day and night!" The old storyteller suddenly came to his senses, and bowed deeply towards the empty air.

The blue-clothed girl also quickly knelt down, kowtowing repeatedly.

In mid-air, Han Li and Ziling stood silently.

"Brother Han, I didn't expect you to have such a chivalrous heart, not only saving them, but also sending them back to their hometown," Ziling said with a light smile.

Han Li didn't say a word, but closed his eyes, as if sensing something, a hint of a smile on his face.

"What's making you so happy, brother Han?" Ziling asked, seeing Han Li's expression.

"I've found a way to sense the benevolent corpse," Han Li said quickly, opening his eyes, a faint smile on his face.

"Really? What's the opportunity?" Ziling asked, surprised and delighted.

Han Li didn't say a word, but pointed to the two people below.

"You mean helping others, it helps you sense the benevolent corpse?" Ziling's eyes sparkled as she said this.

Han Li nodded, smiling.

Earlier, when he had helped the old man and his grandson escape from the Golden Dragon Gang, he had sensed a formless, intangible energy surrounding himself, which had loosened the bottleneck of the benevolent corpse in his body.

As for Han Li sending the old man and his grandson back to their hometown, it was just to verify his feelings, and indeed, when the two people thanked him again, another formless energy spread out.

But the second wave of energy was much weaker than the first.

"It's true, helping others is a good deed, I remember you saying that because you didn't understand the true meaning of 'good', you couldn't sense the benevolent corpse, by helping others, you can deepen your understanding of 'good', and thus help with the benevolent corpse," Ziling was also extremely intelligent, and instantly understood the principle.

"That's right, now that I've found a way, it's easy," Han Li said with a light smile, and then his massive spiritual sense suddenly expanded, spreading out in all directions.

He had now reached the sixth layer of his spiritual cultivation, his spiritual sense had increased greatly, and his range of detection had also increased, covering almost half of the Flying Wing Immortal Domain.

Han Li's spiritual sense had not only increased in range, but also in accuracy, he could sense the actions of countless cultivators and ordinary people within his range, including the old man and his grandson who had been bullied.

He made a seal with his hand, and a golden light enveloped the two people.

The light flashed, and the two people disappeared without a trace.

...

In Feilu Province, on a mountain path, a group of masked bandits blocked a group of escorts, the two sides clashed fiercely.

The bandits were numerous, and had set up an ambush on the mountain path, the escorts were quickly defeated, leaving only the leader, a burly old man, and two escorts, who were still fighting fiercely.

"Ah" "Ah" two cries of pain, the last two escorts fell to the ground, wounded.

The old man's eyes flashed with sadness, but he didn't stop, dancing with his giant ghost-headed knife, the light of the knife flashed, and the bandits were pushed back.

"Xiang Zong, you're the only one left, why don't you kneel down and beg for mercy, we might spare your life," a tall bandit with a cruel smile said.

"I'd rather die than kneel down to you, I'm the leader of the Flying Tiger Escort Bureau, I won't be intimidated by you!" the old man said, his left arm wounded, his body covered in blood, but still unyielding.

"Fine, you're a man of honor, but you're also a fool, you're going to die anyway, so let's end this," the bandit sneered, raising his hand.

The bandits beside him stepped forward, each taking out a giant crossbow, loading it with over a dozen arrows, and aiming at the old man.

"Whoosh" the sound of the crossbows firing echoed through the air.

Over a hundred arrows shot out, like a rain of arrows, towards the old man.
