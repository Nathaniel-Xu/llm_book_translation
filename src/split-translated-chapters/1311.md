"You've been possessed by the sea water, surrender now, or I'll crush your heart and then punch holes in your liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. I guarantee you won't want to try again after experiencing this once." As he spoke, Shui Chang Tian's figure reappeared in the sea, and he raised his long spear to point at Han Li's brow.

"You can try if you can," Han Li said, opening his eyes to look at Shui Chang Tian, his gaze fearless.

Shui Chang Tian's eyebrows furrowed slightly, and he raised a hand, grasping at the air.

After a brief pause, Han Li's body didn't react.

"What's going on?" Shui Chang Tian asked in surprise.

"I don't know, but how much sea water can you control in this area?" Han Li's hands trembled, and the blue vortex surrounding him quivered before dissipating.

"It's the Long River..." Shui Chang Tian's expression changed, and he suddenly realized.

Han Li's River of Time had been flowing continuously, and its power had already seeped into the sea water.

As a result, the sea water was no longer under Shui Chang Tian's control.

Shui Chang Tian let out a loud roar, and his body was enveloped in a surge of blue light that condensed into his long spear. He stabbed the spear at Han Li's brow, and a brilliant blue light burst forth, accompanied by a dense blue light sphere that exploded in front of Han Li's head.

Han Li had anticipated this, and his Tianxia Fuyu technique had already begun to circulate. His body was surrounded by a thousand eight hundred glowing acupoints, and his skin was covered in a layer of six-edged scales.

As the explosion erupted, the surrounding sea water evaporated instantly, and a massive shockwave spread out, creating a ring-shaped tsunami that surged outward.

The tsunami was over ten thousand feet high, resembling a massive mountain peak, and its passage shook the air, even disturbing the clouds in the sky.

Shi Chong Kong looked up, saw that the spiritual domain covering the area had disappeared, and quickly pulled Zi Ling into a spatial secret technique, instantly retreating tens of thousands of miles.

The Heaven's surveillance immortals weren't as lucky, and they were swept away by the tsunami, tumbling into the sea. Those with weaker cultivation were knocked unconscious.

On that day, the entire Black Wind Sea was turbulent, and even the distant Wumeng Island was affected by the tsunami. If not for the timely activation of the island's defensive array, the damage would have been incalculable.

At the center of the explosion, the sea water had evaporated, revealing the dry seabed. The surrounding area was still blocked by a powerful air wall, and the sea water didn't flow back in for a long time.

Han Li stood on a broken mountain ridge, his scales slowly fading away, his forehead bloody and bruised. However, he was actually unharmed.

He simply raised his hand, and a Two-Life Tree shadow swept across his brow, rapidly healing his wounds.

Several thousand miles away, the mountain range created by Han Li's spiritual domain still stood, and the Dong Yi divine tree was growing wildly, its vines stretching over a hundred feet to bind Shui Chang Tian's ankles.

Shui Chang Tian's face was twisted in rage, and he struggled fiercely, but his movements were slow.

A golden moon had descended, hanging behind him, releasing a multitude of dense golden light beams.

Han Li appeared beside him, his sword flashing in the light, and he struck down at Shui Chang Tian's head.

"No! You can't kill me!" Shui Chang Tian's eyes flashed with fear, and he cried out.

Han Li didn't respond, and his sword sliced through Shui Chang Tian's body like a hot knife through butter. However, as the sword entered his body, Shui Chang Tian's form suddenly became transparent, and he liquefied, enveloping the Qing Zhu Feng Yun sword.

Han Li's expression turned cold, and he pinched his fingers together, activating a sword technique. The Qing Zhu Feng Yun sword began to vibrate, releasing a surge of powerful sword energy that burst forth from Shui Chang Tian's body, accompanied by a thousand golden lightning bolts.

A series of explosions erupted, and Shui Chang Tian's liquefied body was instantly torn apart, reduced to a mist.

"He's not easy to kill, even for a Da Luo period cultivator," Han Li said, sheathing his sword and gazing into the distance, his eyebrows furrowed.

In the distance, the scattered water vapor in the air began to coalesce, gradually forming a human shape. After a flash of blue light, Shui Chang Tian's body reappeared.

"Han Li, you've succeeded in angering me. Today, I won't spare you. I'll crush your bones and scatter your ashes," Shui Chang Tian's face twisted in rage.

"Shui Chang Tian, haven't you noticed something's off about your body?" Han Li asked calmly.

Shui Chang Tian's expression faltered, and he checked his body, finding that apart from his cultivation being weakened, there was nothing else out of the ordinary. He snarled, "You're just trying to confuse me. I..."
Before he could finish speaking, he suddenly woke up, his eyes flashing with an unbelievable expression.

"How could this be? My cultivation has regressed so much, even if I was defeated once, I shouldn't have lost so much?" Shuichang Tian said with a hint of panic.

Han Li saw his puzzled expression, but only responded with a cold smile, not intending to explain.

After being in the Wuxing Illusory Realm for so long, how could his cultivation not regress?

"No matter what you've done, as long as we're still on this sea, I can still be invincible." Shuichang Tian's brow furrowed, calming down, and said.

As he spoke, his body suddenly rose high into the air, his hands clasped together in front of him, forming a strange hand seal.

Han Li's eyes flashed, and he saw that around Shuichang Tian's body, a circle of blue, eerie light began to shine, with swirling vortexes of air gathering behind him, emitting a sound like the howling of sea beasts.

At this time, from the distant horizon, Han Li saw a line of water rising rapidly towards them, with a massive black whale swimming at the forefront, as if leading the way, bringing the waves crashing towards them.

"Whoosh!"

 Accompanied by a massive wave of water, a gigantic whirlpool suddenly appeared beneath Shuichang Tian's feet, surging into the air, and merging with his body.

Only to see that the rolling waves entered his body, transforming his entire body into a deep blue color, with a layer of blue water armor covering his body, and his face began to show signs of water lines, his aura rapidly increasing, quickly recovering the cultivation that had been lost due to the Wuxing Illusory Realm.

The surrounding sea water was completely absorbed, leaving behind a desolate, dry landscape, with only the withered corpses of sea creatures remaining, including the massive whale's body.

This method of absorbing the ocean's power was clearly extremely taxing, and Shuichang Tian's body began to rapidly expand, growing to a height of thousands of feet, with blue cracks appearing on his body.

Han Li saw that his aura had already reached the peak of the Daluo Realm, and yet he still didn't stop, wanting to absorb the ocean's water from tens of thousands of miles away, his face slightly pale.

"Great Sun in the Void, Yellow Sand for Ten Thousand Miles."

Suddenly, a low, god-like voice echoed, and a layer of golden ripples spread out from Han Li's body, undulating in the surrounding air.

A massive, blazing fireball descended from the sky, landing on the sea's surface, emitting an intense, fiery aura that instantly raised the temperature of the surrounding area by thousands of degrees.

The seawater that had been rushing towards them was instantly evaporated, and the sea floor beneath Han Li's feet transformed into a vast, yellow sand desert landscape.

Shuichang Tian, who had been absorbing the ocean's power, suddenly lost his connection to the power, and his body began to rapidly dissipate, as if being roasted on a fire.

"This is an illusion..." Shuichang Tian said, disbelieving.

"Illusion? Ha ha, you can try to treat it as an illusion..." Han Li smiled, his eyes glinting.

"No, an illusion wouldn't affect my law's power, you cultivate the time law, how could you have such a strange technique?" Shuichang Tian said, his voice trembling.

"The law speaks of heaven and earth, and follows the words, how could you comprehend it? Receive your death." Han Li's voice exploded.

The blazing fireball descended, hurtling towards Shuichang Tian.

"Enough, with this realm, I should be able to deal with you." Shuichang Tian sighed, his hands clasped together in front of him.

A blue, glowing light flashed, and a massive, blue, curved bow appeared, with a gigantic arrow nocked and ready, its appearance clearly the same as the blue, long spear that Shuichang Tian had wielded earlier.

Shuichang Tian drew the bowstring, and the arrowhead began to condense with dense, law-like energy, a blue, glowing vortex appearing at the arrow's tip.

A piercing sound echoed, and the air in front of the arrow was torn apart, revealing a black, gaping hole.

A deafening explosion shook the air, and the fireball was torn apart, bursting into countless smaller fireballs that scattered everywhere, while the arrow continued to hurtle towards Han Li.

Han Li saw the arrow approaching, and yet he didn't dodge or evade, his body's internal energy surging as he activated the Tianxia Zhenjin Gong, his eighteen thousand acupoints shining brightly, his hand holding the Qingtian Huayun Sword, which he raised in a vertical slash.

The sword's body glowed with golden light, as lightning and electricity surged out, forming a massive, golden sword shadow that clashed with the blue, glowing arrow.

A thunderous explosion shook the air, and the massive arrow disintegrated, Han Li's golden sword shadow dissipating as well, leaving behind a massive, gaping hole in the air that seemed to pulse with dark energy.

At this moment, a figure suddenly emerged from the hole, it was Han Li.

His body rose into the air, his long sword stabbing towards Shuichang Tian's heart.
