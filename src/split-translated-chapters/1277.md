As they entered the grand building, the first thing that caught their eyes was a long, dark corridor that spiralled downwards, leading to a circular underground space that was divided into separate areas.

In the center of the space was a blood-red pool of water, and in the areas that were separated by partitions, there were cages that held various souls.

The soul-reaping envoys were currently putting the souls they had captured into the empty cages, and some of them were standing still beside the blood-red pool, doing who-knows-what.

"It seems this is where they keep the souls, there's nothing to see here, let's go somewhere else and find a way to leave this place as soon as possible," Ti Hu said.

"What's the situation with the Yan Luo Ding, is it still guiding us?" Han Li asked.

"The pulling force from the Ding is guiding us towards the black cloud behind," Ti Hu replied after a moment of hesitation.

Han Li's eyes moved slightly, but he didn't seem surprised, and after thinking for a moment, he said:

"Let's split up and search for a way to leave this blood-red space, we don't need to look outside the city, I've already used my divine sense to search and there's no exit."

"This secret technique should be able to last for a day and a night, and we shouldn't have any problems during that time."

Ti Hu said, and then he and Han Li left the building and split up to search in different directions.

Half a day later, they met up again at the cage building, and both of their faces looked heavy.

They hadn't found a way to leave.

"If all else fails, we can try to break through the blood-red space by force," Ti Hu said.

Han Li was about to say something, but his expression suddenly changed, and he brought Ti Hu back to the cage space below the building, looking at the souls that were being held in the cages.

"What's wrong, Master?" Ti Hu asked, seeing Han Li's actions.

"I suddenly thought of a way to leave this place," Han Li said with a smile.

"What way?" Ti Hu asked, his eyes lighting up.

"This place doesn't seem like the underworld, these souls won't be trapped here forever, they should be sent to the real underworld, if we can find out how they transport the souls, we might be able to leave this place," Han Li said.

"That makes sense, I should have thought of it earlier," Ti Hu said, enlightened.

"But it's not clear when they'll take action," Han Li said, his eyes flickering.

"That's easy, I'll just ask someone," Ti Hu said, pulling Han Li along, and they quickly came to a secluded cage space.

A soul-reaping envoy was putting a soul into a cage, and as he turned to leave, a hand shot out from the darkness and grabbed him, pulling him into the shadows.

A moment later, another soul-reaping envoy came by, and as he passed by the corner, he felt a strange sensation, as if his companion had suddenly disappeared.

He looked around, but there was no one there.

The soul-reaping envoy continued on his way, not paying much attention to the matter.

In the darkness, the soul-reaping envoy was being held by chains of black light, unable to move.

"Squeak squeak, chirp chirp, cheep cheep..." The soul-reaping envoy's body was unable to move, but his face was twisted in anger, and his mouth was making strange noises.

The sounds were like the cries of ghosts in the night, or the scuttling of poisonous insects, and they made one's skin crawl.

"Can you understand what he's saying?" Han Li asked Ti Hu.

Ti Hu shook his head, smiling wryly.

"How about you?" Han Li asked, looking at Sun Zhongshan.

"I understand a bit of the underworld's script, but I don't know much, and I don't understand what they're saying," Sun Zhongshan said, shaking his head.

As he spoke, he looked at Han Li and Ti Hu with a surprised expression.

These two were really something, they had managed to capture a person from the underworld in just a short time.

"No choice, I'll just search his soul directly, even if I don't understand what they're saying, I can at least see his memories," Ti Hu said, and then he pressed his hand against the soul-reaping envoy's head, and a dark glow shot out from his palm, enveloping the envoy.

The soul-reaping envoy's face contorted in pain, and he let out a blood-curdling scream, his body withering away under the dark glow.

A moment later, Ti Hu released his hand.

"How was it, did you find anything?" Han Li asked.

"Just as you guessed, every so often, the underworld will send a ghost general to take the souls in the city to the underworld, according to the timing, the next time the underworld will send someone should be in a few days," Ti Hu said, his eyes shining with excitement.

"That's good, how will the underworld's ghost general come?" Han Li asked, his eyes narrowing.

"They'll come from the black cloud behind, and when they do, a space channel will open, and all the souls in the city will be taken away at once," Ti Hu said.
Han Li's eyes lit up upon hearing this.

Truly, what he thought of came to be.

"Right, we caught a Hooked Soul Envoy, will we be discovered?" Han Li thought of something and asked.

"This is not a concern, Hooked Soul Envoys are numerous, and they are only the outermost members of the Underworld, they will not frequently take roll call." Qiuhun said.

Han Li heard this and finally put his mind at ease.

In the following days, Han Li and Qiuhun did not leave, staying in the Yan Luo Cauldron's space, learning the Underworld's script with Sun Zhongshan.

Qiuhun searched the Hooked Soul Envoy's soul, and had a general understanding of the Underworld's language. With both sides combining their knowledge, Han Li and the others quickly gained a basic understanding of the Underworld's language.

Seven days later, the black clouds behind the blood-red building began to fluctuate violently, emitting a powerful energy fluctuation, causing the entire blood-red space to tremble.

Innumerable black runes flew out from the black clouds, quickly forming a black vortex. At the center of the vortex was a black passageway, looking extremely dark and mysterious, as if leading to the darkest depths of the world.

A black figure flew out from the passageway, wearing a black robe, holding a black staff, with features more refined than the Hooked Soul Envoys, not much different from ordinary people.

The Hooked Soul Envoys in the blood-red city had already gathered in front of the black clouds, escorting the souls of the dead.

"Depart!" The black ghost general waved his staff, speaking in the Underworld's language.

The Hooked Soul Envoys heard this and immediately threw the souls they were escorting forward.

The black passageway emitted a devouring force, and the souls flew in, disappearing into the passageway.

The city's accumulated souls were not many, and were quickly taken in by the black passageway. The black ghost general flashed into the passageway.

The black passageway flashed twice, then quickly closed.

However, before the passageway closed, two blurry shadows flashed in, disappearing into the passageway.

Han Li and Qiuhun felt a massive force tearing at them, the surroundings chaotic, but they gritted their teeth and endured, not making a sound.

After a while, the massive force dissipated.

Han Li and Qiuhun's vision blurred, and they found themselves in a black space, with a massive abyss in front of them.

The abyss was thousands of feet wide, stretching out in both directions, its length unknown. At its center was a deep, dark blackness, leading to unknown depths.

The abyss continuously emitted rolling black air, which contained extremely dense cold air and a strange, ghostly energy.

Unlike ordinary ghostly energy, this energy was extremely pure and heavy, like a liquid.

"Is this the Underworld? It doesn't look like it." Qiuhun looked at the scene before her, muttering to herself, then remembered something and waved her hand, summoning the Yan Luo Cauldron.

The dark red cauldron flashed with light, pointing towards the bottom of the abyss.

Qiuhun's eyes lit up, and she was about to take action, but was stopped by Han Li.

"Wait." Han Li said calmly.

"Master, what's wrong?" Qiuhun asked curiously.

Han Li didn't look at her, but instead gazed towards the abyss, a cold smile on his face, saying: "You think you can hide from me? Come out."

Qiuhun was shocked, looking towards where Han Li was gazing, but still couldn't sense anything.

"Ah, you can actually sense my presence, your divine sense is quite strong." A harsh, scraping voice spoke from the front, using the True Immortal Realm's language.

A black cloud appeared in the void, rapidly growing to several thousand feet in size.

Numerous terrifying, wailing ghostly voices came from the cloud, like countless sharp arrows piercing Han Li and Qiuhun's divine souls.

Qiuhun let out a soft cry of pain, Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and they both quickly activated their divine sense to protect their souls, only then avoiding the effects of the ghostly voices.

The black cloud was surrounded by raging winds, and black air obscured the scene.

Han Li's face turned gloomy, and he waved his right hand, unleashing a blinding golden lightning that violently tore through the surroundings, carrying a powerful sword energy that shattered the void.

The scene above the black cloud was revealed to Han Li and Qiuhun.

They saw that the cloud was densely packed with ghostly creatures, numbering 2,000 to 3,000.

These ghostly creatures were identical to the one Qiuhun had devoured, with similar auras, and each held a black, three-pronged steel spear, arranged in a neat, disciplined formation, like a well-trained army.

Han Li ignored the other ghostly creatures, focusing on the figure at the front, his eyes flashing with caution.

This person was a middle-aged man, with a slender build, looking no different from ordinary people, except for the terrifying blood glow in his eyes, which were fixed on Han Li and Qiuhun with a fierce grin.

He wore a black, long robe that seemed to shift and writhe like a living thing, with various ghostly shadows constantly emerging from beneath it. On his back, he carried a black, several-hundred-foot-long war spear, which flashed with a black, malevolent energy, and emitted a powerful, fierce aura that even Han Li found intimidating.

"Who are you, and why are you ambushing us here?" Han Li examined the man, speaking calmly.
