Han Li said with a hint of mockery, "Since the Third Prince is so eager to know, why not enter the accumulation of scales' empty boundary to investigate? But don't blame me for not warning you, the accumulation of scales' empty boundary is not as safe as the demonic realm. If you're not careful, you might die inside, just like the Eldest Prince."

Shi Po Kong's brow furrowed, and he said in a low voice, "Stone Slashing Wind has indeed died, what a pity."

The two people beside him changed their expressions upon hearing his words.

Han Li stood alone, looking at Shi Po Kong, no longer speaking.

Shi Po Kong's eyes sank, and he said, "Li Dao, actually, you and I don't have any deep grudges or hatred. I have always looked at you with favor, and although the current situation in the sacred domain is unclear, I believe Li Dao is a clever person and can see who has the upper hand between me and the Thirteenth Prince."

Han Li raised an eyebrow and asked, "What do you plan to do with the demonic realm? I don't care about your family's affairs. As long as you don't interfere with the high priest's rescue of the wailing souls, I can let bygones be bygones regarding the matter of the violent empty boundary symbol. Once this is over, I will leave the demonic realm and won't bother you with my presence again. What do you think, Third Prince?"

Shi Po Kong asked, "Li Dao, don't say I'm making things difficult for you. You don't have to tell me everything that happened in the accumulation of scales' empty boundary. Just give me a straight answer about the Thirteenth Prince's situation. Is he dead or alive, and has he returned to the sacred domain?"

Han Li's face suddenly turned cold, and he said, "I've already said it clearly, don't be so greedy and ignorant of the consequences."

As soon as he finished speaking, Han Li's body suddenly became blurry, and he disappeared from his original location.

The next moment, his figure reappeared in front of the left side of the main hall's entrance.

He lightly lifted his foot and stomped on the ground.

A loud crash echoed, and the black stone pavement beneath his feet suddenly erupted in a violent surge of energy, sending rolling smoke and dust into the air. The black stone slabs on the ground cracked and shattered, layer by layer, as if they were being lifted up by an invisible force.

A disheveled figure emerged from the smoke and dust, covered in blood, and fled towards the distance.

Han Li's previous kick had been restrained, as he had feared damaging the main hall behind him. If he had used even half of his strength, the person would not have been able to escape and would have been crushed like the shattered stone slabs.

The figure was small and had black scales covering its body, with sharp claws on its hands. It was clear that it was an expert in earth escape and concealment techniques. After fleeing several hundred feet, it tried to burrow into the ground again.

However, in the blink of an eye, a figure appeared in front of it, lifting its foot to block the figure's sharp claws and holding it in mid-air.

The figure was then caught by a large hand that grasped its throat, rendering it immobile.

Han Li held the figure by the neck and returned to Shi Po Kong's side, saying with a cold smile, "Your earth escape technique is impressive, but you almost managed to sneak into the main hall."

The figure trembled in Han Li's grasp, unable to move.

Shi Po Kong glanced at Han Li, his eyes sinking.

The iron tower-like magic clan member roared, "You dare to harm our Yuan Xi? Release him!"

The old man with a scholarly appearance frowned, his eyes flashing with anger.

Han Li raised an eyebrow and asked, "Release him?"

Without waiting for a response, he twisted his wrist, and the sound of bones cracking echoed as he broke the figure's neck.

He then casually tossed the figure, Yuan Xi, at the iron tower-like magic clan member's feet.

The iron tower-like magic clan member's eyes widened in rage, and he shouted, "You're seeking death!"

A loud roar echoed, and the magic clan member's body began to glow with dark energy, his magic surging. His body expanded, and his armor transformed into a massive magic armor giant.

The magic armor giant raised its hand, and a massive black eight-sided hammer appeared in its palm, surrounded by dark energy.

The giant's body began to glow with red light, and its surroundings were filled with strange ripples, as if the air itself was being distorted.

Han Li's legs felt heavy, as if they were being weighed down by lead, and he was unable to move.

The magic armor giant took a step forward, causing the ground to shudder, and the black stone pavement beneath its feet cracked and shattered.

The giant's hand swung down, and the massive hammer descended towards Han Li, its symbol flashing with energy.

Han Li's head was surrounded by a vortex of energy, as if the air itself was being compressed, and the space around him was being sealed off.

The magic armor giant's eyes flashed with a fierce light, and it thought it had already won.

However, just as it was about to deliver the final blow, its eyes widened in shock as it saw Han Li calmly take a step forward, as if he were strolling through a garden.
Just then, his body slightly bent, his clothes fluttering without wind, and his body seemed to have a series of white light points lit up underneath his clothes.

"That is..." the Demon Armor Giant's mind was puzzled, but his hand movements didn't stop.

"Not good, retreat quickly!" At this time, the emaciated old man's expression suddenly changed, and he loudly shouted.

However, it was already too late.

Only to see Han Li's bent body suddenly straighten up, the Tianxia Town Prison's power surged, and his arms made a loud "popping" sound, the star power in his acupoints bursting out, gathering into a giant white fist shadow outside his arm, and fiercely smashing upwards.

"Boom!" a loud explosion sounded.

The Demon Armor Giant's eight-sided giant hammer, wrapped in demonic energy, was struck, and from the point of impact, it broke apart, the massive hammerhead flying backwards, like a meteor, leaving a trail of light in the night sky, unknown where it landed.

The giant hammer's handle still had a powerful force rotating upwards, directly wrapping around the Demon Armor Giant's arm, like a rope, climbing up to his shoulder and head.

"Boom, boom, boom..."

A series of explosions continued to sound, the Demon Armor Giant's arm armor, along with his flesh and blood, were shattered into pieces by the powerful force, even the exposed white bones were twisted and distorted, almost like a twisted rope.

At this time, the old man in the blue robe suddenly flashed, appearing at the Demon Armor Giant's shoulder, and heavily slapped his shoulder.

Only to see his palm gathering a green light, seemingly without much power, but the force contained within was quite astonishing.

The Demon Armor Giant's shoulder was like a thunderclap, the green light suddenly bursting out from his shoulder, colliding with Han Li's energy, and exploding, completely shattering the Demon Armor Giant's arm.

However, it was precisely this intense collision between the two forces that completely countered Han Li's energy, otherwise, if the power had continued to rise, it would have been the Demon Armor Giant's entire arm that was broken.

"Thank you, Old Qiu..." the Demon Armor Giant's demonic energy retracted, his figure quickly returning to normal, and he opened his mouth to respectfully say.

His expression was somewhat mournful, but no matter how painful his shoulder wound was, he didn't make a single sound.

"This person's fist power has almost been completely neutralized by me, but there's still some residual power at the wound, don't try to regenerate flesh and blood before this power completely disappears, or there will be endless consequences." The old man stood in front of him, warning.

Han Li saw this, and withdrew his hand, standing with his hands behind his back, not continuing to pursue.

"Brother Lei, you've injured two people, and it's not putting our Night City in your eyes, is it?" Shi Po Kong walked forward, coldly smiling, and said.

"I left them two lives, the Third Prince should be grateful." Han Li smiled.

"It seems Brother Lei has made great gains in the Accumulated Scales Realm, and now has the confidence to challenge our entire Sacred Clan?" Shi Po Kong's expression became increasingly serious, and he slowly said.

"The Third Prince doesn't need to use the Demon Clan to intimidate me, I, Lei, have no intention of being enemies with the Demon Clan, but if the Third Prince insists on forcing me, I don't mind causing a big commotion in Night City. I know that as the capital city, Night City naturally has powerful seniors sitting in, like the Old Qiu in front of me, who is not ordinary." Han Li said, glancing at the old man.

The latter's eyes were like stars, his gaze falling on Han Li, becoming even brighter, and his aura also rose to its peak, his entire body's aura changing, no longer like the harmless appearance from before.

"But what about that? If I, Lei, have made up my mind to die together with the enemy, even if I can't destroy half of Night City, I can still destroy half of the Demon Palace. At that time, the Third Prince, as the ruler, will certainly be blamed. Moreover, during the time the Eldest Prince was in power, it was a time of great peace and prosperity, but now, the Third Prince has destroyed the palace, who is better or worse, it's clear. Like this, haha... I don't need to say more, do I?" Han Li indifferently smiled, and continued.

Shi Po Kong heard this, his expression unchanged, but his heart was deeply contemplative.

Regarding Han Li's words, he had already thought of it, and even understood the consequences, that his father would be enraged, and his position as ruler would be revoked, and Shi Jingyan would certainly take advantage of the situation.

Like this, he would have worked hard to get rid of Shi Zhanfeng, only to do it for someone else.

He was hesitant because he still had one thing he couldn't confirm, that was whether Han Li really had the ability to destroy half of the Demon Palace.

"This person's Xuan repair power has already surpassed mine, wanting to defeat him might not be difficult, but wanting to kill him is extremely hard, what he said about destroying half of the Sacred Palace is not empty words..." At this time, his mind suddenly heard Old Qiu's voice.

Shi Po Kong was silent for a moment, then suddenly smiled, and said:

"Originally, I wanted to recruit Brother Lei to my side, to create a glorious foundation together, but now it seems I was one-sided. Since Brother Lei insists, I won't force it anymore, but I still hope Brother Lei will keep his promise, and leave the Sacred Domain immediately."

"This is natural, but I'll need to use the transmission array in the aristocratic families to leave." Han Li smiled.

"Tomorrow morning, Brother Lei can come to the Sacred Palace, and I'll send you away." Shi Po Kong naturally wanted to send Han Li away as soon as possible, and agreed.

"Then I'll trouble the Third Prince... since there's nothing more to do here, everyone can leave." Han Li smiled, and actually gave the order to leave, like a host.

Shi Po Kong's expression stiffened, and he gritted his teeth, leading the others to leave.
