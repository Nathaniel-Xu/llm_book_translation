Shi Zhan Feng seemed to have anticipated this, not moving, but with a single hand flip, a golden sphere appeared in his palm, which he tossed upwards.

The golden sphere glowed with a brilliant light and a series of mechanical sounds could be heard. As it exploded, a blast of golden light enveloped Shi Zhan Feng's figure.

As the light dissipated, the golden sphere had vanished, replaced by a golden cage several feet in diameter, encasing Shi Zhan Feng's figure.

The Winged Puppet flew before him, its four wings flapping in unison, releasing a flurry of sharp, white, feather-like blades that shot towards Shi Zhan Feng with great speed.

The blades ripped through the air, leaving behind a trail of black lines that vanished in an instant.

On the other side, the Beast Puppet had arrived, its head suddenly cocked to one side, as a stream of white light emerged from its mouth, transforming into a streak of silver lightning that struck the cage.

The lightning and flames engulfed the golden cage, as the sound of clashing blades and thunder rumbled on.

Han Li fixed his gaze on the golden cage, his brow furrowing in concern.

As the lightning dissipated, the golden cage, though covered in scars, remained intact.

Inside, Shi Zhan Feng stood unscathed, his face solemn, clutching a crystal sphere in one hand, and using his other hand to etch symbols onto the sphere with his bloody index finger, as if attempting to remove the crystal seal.

Han Li's brow furrowed, hesitant about whether to take the crystal sphere for himself.

He could sense that the crimson heart within the crystal sphere was no ordinary object, imbued with an aura akin to the Blood Tears Array, and seemed to have a connection to the 'Demon King' corpse in the crystal coffin.

Though he had little interest in Sha Xin's efforts to revive the 'Demon King', he couldn't help but suspect a connection to Xi Dao Ren, and it would be a shame to let Shi Zhan Feng take the crystal sphere.

However, if he were to intervene, he would be seen as trying to take advantage of the situation, and risk facing both Sha Xin and E He Bi together. Han Li was uncertain if he could escape, let alone defend himself.

As Han Li hesitated, his gaze caught Stone Piercing Void's shoulder subtly moving, as if trying to signal him.

Han Li transmitted his voice to Stone Piercing Void, "Stone brother, are you alright?"

Stone Piercing Void's shoulders moved once more, and after a pause, he replied, "I'm fine, brother... can you do me a favor?"

Han Li said, "Endure for a bit longer, and when they're distracted, I'll find a way to rescue you."

However, Stone Piercing Void swiftly countered, "No need to rescue me yet... please, you must take the heart from Shi Zhan Feng's hands. No matter what, he must not consume it, or else... the consequences will be catastrophic..."

Han Li inquired, "Stone brother, what is the purpose of that heart, and why is Shi Zhan Feng so desperate to obtain it?"

Stone Piercing Void's transmission grew more urgent, "I don't fully understand its purpose, but it's crucial to Shi Zhan Feng... perhaps even a key to helping him transcend the Heavenly Gate... if he consumes it and refines it within his body... you and I won't need to return to the Sacred Realm..."

Han Li's thoughts turned over, and before he could respond, his expression changed.

A dense, robust life force and a boundless, golden aura burst forth from within the golden cage.

Shi Zhan Feng had broken through the crystal sphere's seal and held the crimson heart, his eyes blazing with fervor.

As he was about to consume the heart, a sudden, loud explosion shook the air, accompanied by a deafening roar.

A figure emerged from the blood lake, creating a massive whirlpool that blew the golden cage asunder, shattering it into two halves.
Han Li burst out of a massive silver electric glow, throwing a hook punch that heavily struck Shi Zhanfeng's chest.

"Plop..."

A dense, starry white glow suddenly erupted through his chest, directly creating a round, bloody cavity. A massive amount of dark red blood splattered out like rainwater.

Shi Zhanfeng's body, with this immense force, flew upwards and struck the dome above.

A deafening "Boom" sounded.

The underground dome violently shattered, shattering stone everywhere without any falling down, all pierced through the ground by the fierce aura. Only Shi Zhanfeng's body returned from the hollowed dome.

A massive blood wave splashed from the blood pool, and Shi Zhanfeng slowly stood up from the bloody water.

He didn't look at his chest, covered in blood, but stared at his empty hands, issuing a heartbreaking scream:

"No..."

On the other side of the Blood Lake, Han Li stood still.

He held a heart that jumped with each beat, revealing a thoughtful expression.

Others saw this and were shocked, and even Sha Xin was momentarily stunned.

E Mei, however, didn't pay attention to Han Li and Shi Zhanfeng's situation. During Sha Xin's momentary stun, her body transformed into a cyan smoke, appearing beside Sha Xin and then extending to the crystal coffin.

Sha Xin was shocked and attempted to stop her but failed.

E Mei flashed past Sha Xin and appeared beside the crystal coffin. Her eyes heated up, and with lightning speed, she grasped towards the corpse inside.

At this moment, a white bone awl suddenly emerged, sending an ear-piercing sound, as it thrust onto E Mei's wrist and knocked it off. It was Kun Yu once again.

"You're seeking death!"

E Mei's eyes had a cold glint after being obstructed twice by Kun Yu. Her hand transformed into a fist, swinging back at Kun Yu's awl, sending a dull, thunderous sound.

Bang!

The white bone awl shattered and flew in Kun Yu's direction and entered his chest. Kun Yu couldn't react and was knocked flying.

E Mei's fist flew Kun Yu away, then swung her other hand again towards the corpse in the coffin.

Just then, a dazzling golden light pillar descended from the sky. It distorted the air, sending a sharp whine as it headed towards E Mei's head.

E Mei snorted coldly, with the same fist that knocked Kun Yu away, striking towards the golden light. Her grasping hand didn't stop.

The golden light collided with E Mei's fist, producing a deafening thunderous sound, and the golden light erupted, spreading out in all directions.

E Mei halted her body movement, her foot sinking half a foot into the ground, a stunned look on her face.

Before she could adjust her body, a 4- to 5-zhang long golden tail swung out from the golden light. It struck E Mei with a deafening "Boom."

E Mei's body flew out, and the golden light vanished, only to reveal a 20- to 30-zhang long golden dragon puppet in the air.

Its dragon head shone brightly like solid gold, and on its head rested a pair of coral-like dragon horns. Its golden scales and sturdy dragon tail displayed its immense power. Its massive claws looked incredibly powerful.

In the golden light, a golden giant tiger, a golden turtle, and a golden bird appeared alongside the crystal coffin.

The three new puppets were no less impressive in appearance or aura compared to the dragon puppet. The four puppets released an undistinguished aura, similar to one another.

Sha Xin flew onto the golden bird's back, extending her crystalline threads into the four puppets.

Although her injuries had disappeared, her face was as white as snow. Blood flowed from the corner of her mouth, leaving a trail at her pale lips, incredibly noticeable.

E Mei's four puppets shot towards E Mei and positioned themselves between her and the crystal coffin.

"Indeed, the heavenly cage's four-image battle puppet lives up to its name, but with you injured, Shan Qing, you can't utilize your full strength. Let's see how much power you can muster," E Mei said with a cold laugh, unfazed.

With her statement, her figure blurred, and she charged forward once again.

(Situation unresolved.)
