Among the crowd, there were many who were experienced and knowledgeable, and they all had similar guesses about the current situation. However, they had not dared to confirm it before, and now that they had heard Lei Yu Ce's words, they naturally believed it to be true, and their faces turned somewhat ugly.

Now that the entrance was gone, the entire secret realm space was on the verge of collapse. Were so many people going to be trapped here for no reason?

"Gentlemen, there's no need to worry. Since this is the Da Luo Cave, there must be a way out. Although the secret realm space is weak, I think it will last for at least a month, which is enough time for us to find a way out." Lei Yu Ce said, seeing the situation.

The cultivators heard his words and, after a moment of commotion, their emotions calmed down slightly. However, many people still looked terrified.

"Gentlemen, please listen to me for a moment." Wen Zhong, who was standing beside Lei Yu Ce, stepped forward and said in a loud voice.

His voice was not loud, but it was clear to everyone's ears, as if he was speaking directly to them.

The crowd was currently in a state of confusion, and when they heard his words, they all looked over.

"This cave's secret realm is indeed strange, not only is time pressing, but the front is also full of unknown dangers. If we all act separately, I'm afraid we'll not only fail to obtain the treasures, but also increase the risk of injury and death. In my opinion, we might as well work together and form an alliance. Although the front is full of dangers, if we combine our strength, we can surely overcome them. What do you think, gentlemen?" Wen Zhong said with a smile.

"Not bad, it's better to work together. We're all influential figures, and it's not easy to have reached our current level. There's no need to risk our lives for some unheard-of legends." Tian Shui Zong's Jin Liu also spoke up.

The others heard their words and looked at each other, but no one spoke up for a moment.

As for Wen Zhong's suggestion, most people's initial reaction was to refuse. Working together would require following orders, and they were all powerful figures from different factions, each seeking to gain an advantage.

However, the current situation was indeed strange, and who knew what dangers lay ahead? Working together also had its benefits.

Moreover, the proposal was made by the Tong Tian Sword Sect, and Tian Shui Zong had also agreed to it.

Furthermore, the Tong Tian Sword Sect, Tian Shui Zong, and Jin Yuan Xian Palace were the three major powers in the Jin Yuan Xian Domain. Now that Jin Yuan Xian Palace was weak, the Tong Tian Sword Sect and Tian Shui Zong had become even more powerful, and their influence was greater than before. The others present were all from smaller factions, and they dared not openly refuse.

"Gentlemen, there's no need to worry too much. Our alliance is only temporary, and there won't be many rules. Whatever treasures we find in the secret realm will belong to each of us. We just need to follow the alliance's arrangements when it comes to how to proceed in the secret realm, and we must not act on our own." Wen Zhong said again.

The cultivators heard his words and most of them let out a sigh of relief.

The alliance's rules were not many, and the treasures they found would belong to each of them. That was acceptable, and they all nodded in agreement.

"Since everyone has agreed, the alliance is now officially formed." Lei Yu Ce said loudly, scanning the crowd with his eyes.

The crowd was scanned by Lei Yu Ce's gaze, and they all felt a chill run down their spines. They unconsciously looked away, not daring to meet his eyes.

"Now that the alliance is formed, we should also decide on a leader. Lei Yu Ce's strength is unparalleled, and he is the most suitable person to be the leader. Su Xian Zi's strength is second only to Lei Yu Ce, and she can be the deputy leader. What do you think, gentlemen?" Wen Zhong said.

The people from Tian Shui Zong looked at each other, but no one spoke up. They were all tacitly consenting.

This alliance was formed by the Tong Tian Sword Sect's efforts, and Tian Shui Zong had also agreed to it. As for the arrangement, the others had already guessed it and did not object.

"Since everyone has shown their appreciation, I, Lei Yu Ce, will not decline. I will set one rule: no one is allowed to harm their companions. Can you all agree to this?" Lei Yu Ce said in a deep voice.

"We will follow the leader's orders!" The crowd heard that there was only one rule, and no one objected.

"Good, then let's set off and explore this Ta Sui Fu!" Lei Yu Ce waved his hand, leading the way forward.

The others followed closely, and soon they arrived at the palace where Han Li had been meditating.

The golden light pillar that had risen from the palace had already disappeared.

The crowd saw the palace and was overjoyed. Some impatient people were about to fly down and search the palace.

"Don't be reckless, listen to the leader's orders!" Wen Zhong shouted, stopping them.

The others heard his words and remembered that they were now under the alliance's jurisdiction. They reluctantly restrained themselves.

"Wen Zhong, Jin Liu, Qing Suo Valley Master, Mo Xiang Lou Master, take a team of people and go into the palace to take a look." Lei Yu Ce said.

Wen Zhong and the others heard his words and nodded. They quickly led their teams into the palace.

The others were envious, but they could not do anything.

However, in a short while, Wen Zhong and the others returned, their faces looking somewhat ugly.

"Leader, we've found that the things in the palace have all been taken away, and there are signs of a recent battle. It seems that someone has entered the secret realm before us." Wen Zhong said, his face stern.
Everyone was shocked upon hearing this, and a commotion broke out.

"Are you certain?" Lei Yu Ce asked, his brow furrowed in concern.

"I'm absolutely sure," Wen Zhong replied confidently.

"Could it be that someone has already been here before us? Whatever the case, let's continue forward for now." Lei Yu Ce's brow was furrowed, and after a moment of contemplation, he gave the order.

The alliance members continued forward, soon exiting the valley and entering a vast, open area. The sudden change in scenery lifted everyone's spirits.

Lei Yu Ce's heart also relaxed slightly, as the vastness of the secret realm made it unlikely that anyone could have searched the entire area thoroughly.

Moreover, it was clear that the other party had not yet left, and if they had made any discoveries, Lei Yu Ce would not hesitate to use force to make them comply.

"Wen Zhong, Jing Liu, divide the people into twenty teams and have them search in different directions. Don't go too far, and return after half a day," Lei Yu Ce instructed.

Wen Zhong and the others quickly divided the teams and assigned them to different areas to search.

During the division of the search areas, the Qing Su Valley and Mo Xiang Lou factions were assigned to remote areas, while the Tong Tian Sword Sect and Tian Shui Sect members were sent to the deeper parts of the secret realm.

The Qing Su Valley and other factions were dissatisfied with the arrangement, but they did not dare to speak out.

Meanwhile, in a different part of the secret realm, a vast, misty hillside area was filled with the faint scent of medicinal herbs.

The hillside was divided into three layers, covering an area of several hundred meters, and was home to a vast array of medicinal herbs, each with an age of at least tens of thousands of years.

At present, over a hundred giant ape puppets were busy digging up various medicinal herbs, working tirelessly to transport them to the outside of the hillside.

Outside the hillside, a massive silver gate stood in the void, leading to another medicinal herb garden.

Han Li stood at the entrance of the silver gate, directing the giant ape puppets to transplant the medicinal herbs into the garden, categorizing them by their properties.

At this moment, Qi Huan emerged from the side of the hillside and reported, "Master, the medicinal herbs with an age of over a million years have already been transplanted. Those that are not suitable for transplantation have been harvested and stored in the pharmacy."

Han Li furrowed his brow, thinking for a moment before asking, "Our medicinal herb garden has limited space, and I'm afraid there's not much room left."

Qi Huan shook her head, "There's no more space left."

Han Li nodded, "The medicinal herbs we transplanted earlier were done so at the minimum interval ratio. If we want to open up new medicinal herb fields, we'll need to transplant them again, or else it will affect the growth of the medicinal herbs."

Han Li paused, looking up at the sky in the distance, and his expression changed slightly.

"What's wrong?" Qi Huan asked, noticing the change.

"The secret realm has been breached, and outsiders have entered... We can't continue like this, it seems we'll have to resort to old tricks again." Han Li said, deep in thought.

"Old tricks? Master, what do you mean?" Qi Huan asked, slightly perplexed.

"These medicinal herbs don't need to be taken care of by the puppets for now. Just have them transplant all the nine-leaf ice grass, Tian Yang Tong Hua, and Zhong Ling Cao into the cave's medicinal herb field. Even if they're not yet ten thousand years old, transplant them all. As for the other medicinal herbs that are not yet mature, don't bother transplanting them."

Qi Huan was puzzled, "Master, nine-leaf ice grass and Tian Yang Tong Hua are both necessary for the preparation of various elixirs. I understand why you want to transplant them, even if they're not yet ten thousand years old. But why do you want to transplant the Zhong Ling Cao as well? It's not a rare herb."

Han Li smiled, "You don't know the secret, do you? The Zhong Ling Cao has auxiliary catalytic properties. If we transplant it together with the nine-leaf ice grass and Tian Yang Tong Hua, and they're mature enough, the nine-leaf ice grass may produce a variant, the nine-leaf ice flame grass, and the Tian Yang Tong Hua may produce a variant, the Tian Yang fire Tong Hua."

Qi Huan's eyes widened in understanding, "I see, I didn't know that."

Han Li continued, "And what about the Jing Yan Huo Niao?"

Qi Huan replied, "It obtained a nine-yang fire gall from the Zhi Yang Lou the other day. After eating it, it seemed to be uncomfortable and has been hiding in the Lian Tang Zhu Lou ever since."

Han Li couldn't help but feel a mixture of emotions. The Jing Yan Huo Niao had only just eaten the seven-colored fire sand, and now it had swallowed the nine-yang fire gall, which was second only to the fire sand in terms of its fire properties. Would it really cause any problems?

But thinking about the Jing Yan Huo Niao's proud expression earlier, Han Li felt a bit more at ease. The Jing Yan Huo Niao was no longer the same as it was before, and if it were to unleash its true flames, Han Li would have a headache dealing with it.
