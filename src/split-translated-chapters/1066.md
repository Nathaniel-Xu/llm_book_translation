Han Li waved his hand to close the light door behind him, and his body swayed slightly as he flew towards the broken temple, landing in front of the remaining circular stone gate.

The stone gate had two broken wooden doors in the middle, with severe peeling of the red paint, looking extremely dilapidated.

On the two wooden doors, a bronze beast-shaped carving was embedded, resembling a Pixiu, with some resemblance to "Little White". The carving held a large bronze ring in its mouth, with dense talismanic patterns engraved around it.

From the talismanic patterns, it was clear that this was not a particularly profound restriction, but the fluctuations it emitted were identical to the feeling when entering the third layer of space.

Without a doubt, the fourth layer was also easy to enter, but difficult to exit.

Han Li looked at it for a moment, then put aside his slightly disturbed emotions and began to set up the array to break the restriction.

Before long, two flashes of light flew in from a distance, and Jing Liu and Su Zhenyan arrived, landing behind Han Li.

"Stone friend..." Jing Liu's eyes were complex, and after a moment of hesitation, he hurriedly bowed and said.

Su Zhenyan only looked at Han Li's back, without bowing or speaking, and her eyes were filled with wariness and doubt towards the person in front of her, who was completely different from before.

"Did you catch up?" Han Li asked casually, without turning his head, continuing to work on the array.

"Those two ghostly generals injured two of our sect's elders, we can't let them off." Jing Liu saw that Han Li didn't turn his head, and his eyes didn't show any displeasure, only some hesitation.

"I'll go arrange for their bodies to be taken care of." Su Zhenyan said to Jing Liu, and her body flashed away.

Jing Liu watched her leave, and soon turned back to stare at Han Li.

He furrowed his brow, thinking for a moment, before finally asking, "Stone friend, your methods are extraordinary, but you've always been secretive and never acted. Is there something you're not saying?"

"A lone cultivator, always cautious, Jing friend doesn't need to be too alert, I have no grudges with you, and I don't want to have any grudges with you." Han Li replied, still not turning his head.

"Earlier, I was blind to your abilities, and I was rude to you. But from the fact that you helped Master Pei and the others, I can see that you're not a narrow-minded person. So I'm not worried about having a grudge with you, but I want to form an alliance with you." Jing Liu said, his eyes flashing with a hint of apology.

"I'm used to traveling alone, so forming an alliance is unnecessary. Besides, in this situation, even if I agreed to form an alliance, could we truly trust each other?" Han Li smiled and said.

"This..." Jing Liu hesitated.

"Traveling together is already a coincidence, if we have the chance to help each other, we can do so. Otherwise, let's not force it. When the time is right, we'll part ways and go our separate ways." Han Li said slowly.

As he finished speaking, he finished setting up the array to break the restriction, and clapped his hands together.

The sound of "clang clang" came from the circular stone gate, and the Pixiu carving's mouth opened, revealing a dark red light door.

"Since you've said so, then let's follow your words." Jing Liu looked at the light door, and his heart slightly relaxed, nodding in agreement.

At this time, Su Zhenyan also flew back, and the three of them exchanged a few words before entering the light door together, disappearing from sight.

...

In a certain place within the Years Tower.

On a desolate and barren land covered in rocks, a lone black and white stone monument stood, with a strange figure leaning against one of the pillars.

The figure had long and wide limbs, with skin as red as fire, and a head of fiery red hair, with flames flickering within. This was none other than Qi Mozi, who had just had a fierce battle with Han Li.

His hands were clasped together in front of him, and his body was slightly floating, with a layer of golden light waves constantly rippling around him, clearly in the midst of cultivating a higher-level technique.

A moment later, his eyes suddenly opened, and a flash of anger appeared in his eyes.

"A 'Disaster Time Flowing Fire Collection' is nothing but a waste of time, even if I cultivate for a thousand years. Old Ancestor, who did you truly pass on the 'Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique' to? Could it be that that kid is also your closed-door disciple?"

Qi Mozi's teeth clenched, his voice filled with anger.

After a moment of silence, he began to speculate, "Or perhaps... that kid is like that gray-haired old mouse, and he secretly listened to the teachings within the sect?"

But he quickly shook his head, rejecting his own idea.

If it was possible to understand the secrets of the 'Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique' just by listening to the teachings, then wouldn't he and his fellow disciples be nothing but fools?

"It's fortunate that this kid has only grasped the surface of the technique, and the effects of the Five Elements Fantasy won't last long. Once my cultivation is restored, the next time we meet, I won't give him any chance. I'll kill him, even if it means I won't obtain the technique, otherwise, he'll become a great threat in the future." Qi Mozi slowly exhaled a breath of turbid air, calming his emotions, and muttered to himself.

As he finished speaking, his eyes narrowed, and his hands began to form a seal, continuing to cultivate and refine his technique.
At the same time, Han Li and the other two appeared on a vast ice plain.

The place where they stood was a thick layer of ice, and when they looked around, they could see many towering ice mountains in the distance, emitting a dazzling glow.

The ice plain was also extremely cold, with a fierce wind blowing, like the roar of a dragon, causing the ice flakes to fly everywhere.

Behind them, several hundred meters away, stood a massive ice mountain, with a spatial door embedded in it, flashing with a bright red light.

Next to the spatial door stood a stone stele, with a single character "Four" written on it.

When the three saw the scene before them, they all showed a hint of surprise, but they didn't relax, cautiously exploring their surroundings.

Han Li raised an eyebrow, and sensed that the time restriction in the void was stronger than the third layer, and the restriction on his divine sense was also greater, only allowing him to extend it to about half of the third layer. The impact on his speed was also likely to be greater.

"Let's go and explore the surroundings," Su Zhenzi said softly, her body flying upwards.

Han Li and Jing Liu also flew up, and the three of them chose a direction to head in.

As Han Li flew, his eyes flashed, and he saw that the speed of flight in this layer was indeed affected, and was only about half of the third layer.

Of course, the three of them didn't fly at full speed, but were extremely cautious, always on the lookout for their surroundings.

Han Li flew forward, his face calm, but his heart was like walking on thin ice, his divine sense fully open to monitor the surroundings.

He had long expected that Qi Mozi would be in this secret realm, but his appearance still gave him a great shock.

He had thought that his own strength had increased greatly, and that he would be able to handle Qi Mozi, but he didn't expect to be in such a difficult situation.

Moreover, he was now unable to use his divine abilities, and his strength had decreased greatly. Qi Mozi, although injured by the sudden change in the "Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique", had not been seriously harmed, and he didn't know if he would suddenly appear again.

And even if he didn't, as they continued to head towards the higher levels of the Tower of Time, they would eventually meet again, and it would likely be a battle to the death.

It seemed that he had inadvertently used a secret technique of the Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique, and had deceived Qi Mozi, but with his cunning, he was likely to have already recovered. When they met again, it would not be a simple matter of one side escaping, but a true battle to the death.

Han Li sighed, and took out two recovery pills, swallowing them and using his full strength to refine them, recovering the consumed spiritual energy.

The consecutive battles had also consumed a lot of his spiritual energy.

As the pills were refined, his consumed spiritual energy slowly recovered, and to his surprise, the dormant True Word Treasure Wheel and other time law objects began to stir, showing signs of awakening.

Han Li sensed this, and his heart was filled with joy, and he put down the worry in his heart, and focused on refining the pills.

Su Zhenzi and Jing Liu seemed to be doing the same, as they slowly moved forward, observing their surroundings and recovering their strength.

Time passed, and it wasn't long before half a day had passed.

It was somewhat unexpected that during this time, they didn't encounter anything, neither treasures nor metal beasts, nor fire insects.

Everything was quiet, but there was a sense of eeriness.

"What's going on? We've been traveling for so long, and it's been so calm, it's making me feel uneasy," Jing Liu said softly.

Han Li's brow was also furrowed, and this layer was indeed strange, they had walked for so long, and there was no sign of danger, only ice plains, ice mountains, and cold winds.

"This place is indeed strange, there's no sign of danger, but that's also good, we can look for the entrance to the next layer," Su Zhenzi said thoughtfully.

Han Li and Jing Liu had no objections, and they continued to scan their surroundings with their divine sense.

The three of them continued to search for half a day, but still found nothing, until they came to a massive ice mountain, where they finally discovered something different.

At the base of the ice mountain stood a group of palaces, made of a blue material, but without any cold aura, seemingly made of a type of jade.

The layout of the palaces was similar to the ancient temple in the third layer, but without the 30% eerie atmosphere.

However, the palaces were now in ruins, and had been for a long time, with many places frozen and sealed in ice.

The three of them saw this, and were initially stunned, before exchanging a glance.

"Looking at the layout of this place, it's similar to the third layer. According to the Ghost King's words, each layer of the Tower of Time imprisons a powerful prisoner, and there should be a powerful monster inside, we need to be careful," Su Zhenzi said seriously.

"Not bad, being careful can't be wrong," Jing Liu said.

Han Li nodded, and the three of them cautiously approached the palaces.
