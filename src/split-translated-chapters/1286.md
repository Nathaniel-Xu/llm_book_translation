"Ghost Witch fellow, this patch of Ghost Domain's Great Marsh appears to be calm, but it shouldn't be a good place, right?" Han Li said, ignoring Jin Tong.

"Hehe, where in the Underworld is there a good place? It's already good that it's like this. The Ghost Domain's Great Marsh is filled with dense miasma, which has been accumulating for a long time, and has formed a five-colored poisonous cloud in the sky. However, with your large bodies, as long as you don't fly high, you can enter the poisonous cloud without any problems." Ghost Witch replied with a chuckle.

"That's not a problem, but where is the Yanluo's Manor you mentioned?" Han Li asked.

"It's not far, we're almost there." Ghost Witch said.

"You've said that at least five or six times, is the Yanluo's Manor really in this marsh?" Qiuhun looked at Ghost Witch with a frown, asking.

"I feel that this place is very desolate, it doesn't look like there's any buildings or houses around. You're not trying to trick us, are you?" Jin Tong also looked suspicious, saying.

"I wouldn't dare trick you! The Yanluo's Manor is actually on a solitary island in the middle of the Great Marsh, but it's surrounded by a strange law array, and no one has ever been able to enter... As for how strange it is, you'll understand when you see it." Ghost Witch hastily said.

"Since that's the case, please lead the way, Ghost Witch fellow. We'll go take a look." Han Li said.

"From here, head west for about 300,000 miles, and you'll see a forest. The trees there are quite special... Let's go there first..." Ghost Witch said.

As soon as Ghost Witch finished speaking, Han Li and the others flew into the air, but only hovered about a hundred yards above the Great Marsh, flying low.

After a while, in the distance, a black withered tree over a hundred yards tall appeared.

The tree trunk was extremely thick, but it was completely black and dry, like it had been burned to charcoal. There was no sign of life, and the branches were bare and scattered, like a pair of sinister ghost claws stretching out in all directions.

The vines were like willow branches hanging down from the tree branches, with thousands of withered corpses hanging from them, each one looking different, making one's scalp feel numb.

Behind the withered tree, in the midst of the misty fog, one could faintly see that every so often, there was another withered tree, densely packed, stretching out to the horizon.

Just as Han Li and the others were about to approach, Ghost Witch suddenly spoke up to remind them:

"Those trees are Hanging Corpse Ghost Vines, and they're quite troublesome. Don't get too close. We only need to use this area as a coordinate, head north for about 1,700,000 miles, and find a piece of Ghostly Marsh Rock that resembles a ghost. From there, head west for 800,000 miles, and you'll reach the island where the Yanluo's Manor is located."

Han Li and the others heard this, and immediately stopped in their tracks, flying north once again.

...

Han Li and the others followed Ghost Witch's lead, turning and winding their way, for about three days, until they finally arrived at the solitary island in the Great Marsh.

From a distance of over a thousand miles, the island seemed to be surrounded by a barrier, with all the misty fog and poisonous clouds blocked out, making the island's surroundings clear and clean, looking like a piece of outside land.

However, Han Li quickly sensed that something was off, and that the barrier contained a powerful time law.

The three of them flew over, hovering outside the barrier, looking at the island inside, and saw that time seemed to have stopped.

The trees on the island were lush and green, and seemed to be swaying gently in the breeze, but were frozen in place. Even the birds flying overhead were frozen in mid-air, with their wings spread wide.

"Is this the Yanluo's Manor?" Qiuhun asked, looking around.

"Yes, it is." Ghost Witch replied.

"What's going on here?" Jin Tong asked in surprise.

"This barrier is filled with time law, which has sealed the time inside. Everything is frozen in place, and no one has been able to enter for a long time, let alone set foot on the island." Ghost Witch explained.

Han Li looked around, feeling a bit puzzled:

"This barrier does contain a dense time law, but it's not an extremely powerful killing array, or an impenetrable defensive array. Why hasn't anyone been able to break through it?"

Ghost Witch hesitated before speaking:

"You can try it yourself, Han fellow. You'll understand why."

" Humph! You're just pretending to be mysterious, old man. Wait for me to try first." Jin Tong said, her eyes flashing with gold light, and before Han Li could stop her, she charged forward, heading straight for the barrier.

"Wait..."

Han Li only had time to shout out two words before he was shocked to see Jin Tong, who had used brute force to charge into the barrier, being enveloped in a golden light, and instantly retreating back outside the barrier.

" Humph! You're just pretending to be mysterious, old man. Wait for me to try first." Jin Tong said again, her body flashing with gold light, and she charged forward once more.
It was only an instant later that she returned to her original position, saying "Hmph! You're just pretending to be mysterious, old man. Wait for me to try first." With a flash of golden light, she charged towards the barrier once again, her expression unchanged from before. It seemed that she was unaware of her repeated actions.

Just as she was about to collide with the barrier again, Han Li grasped her wrist with a hand covered in golden light.

"Old man, what are you doing? Let me try first," Jin Tong said, trying to shake off Han Li's hand.

"You've tried many times already, it's useless," Han Li replied.

"Old man, are you blind? I haven't even tried once yet... Qiuhun, is the old man confused?" Jin Tong asked, looking puzzled.

"Master, you're not mistaken. You've indeed tried many times already," Qiuhun said.

"Really? I don't remember," Jin Tong said, looking confused.

Han Li fell silent for a moment, and then realized why the ghost witch had said that this place was strange.

"This barrier has a time-sealing effect. Anyone who enters will be affected by the time law, causing them to remain in the state they were in before entering the barrier. If no one intervenes, they'll be stuck in this state forever," Han Li explained.

"I don't quite understand," Jin Tong said, scratching his head.

Qiuhun also looked puzzled.

"It means that even if you try a million times, you'll just be transported back to the outside of the barrier, and you won't even realize it," Han Li added.

The ghost witch's voice rang out, "Ah, Han Daoist, you're indeed skilled in the time law. Your insight is impressive, and you've seen through the barrier's effects in just a few moments... However, this repetition won't last forever. Once a certain number of attempts is reached, the intruder's physical body will be broken down by the time law, and their spiritual energy will flow into the array, nourishing it."

As soon as the ghost witch finished speaking, Qiuhun and Jin Tong were shocked. Han Li, however, didn't show any surprise, and his eyes continued to scan the surface of the barrier as if considering something.

"Old thing, why didn't you say so earlier? You want to kill me!" Jin Tong exclaimed.

"You've only tried seven or eight times, it's not a problem. To reach the level I mentioned, you'd need to try at least ten thousand times. But for the person involved, unless someone intervenes, they won't even feel it. In other words, from the moment they start, their fate is sealed," the ghost witch said.

"Ghost witch, do you know how to break this seal?" Han Li asked.

The ghost witch laughed dryly, "Ah, Daoist, you're joking, right? If I knew how to break this seal, wouldn't this Yanluo's estate be mine already?"

Han Li knew that the ghost witch was telling the truth.

"However, to untie the knot, one must first tie the knot. Since this barrier is forged from the time law, to break it, one must start from the time law itself," the ghost witch said.

Han Li listened and seemed to understand something. He then made a hand seal, and his mouth began to chant softly.

A wave of time law fluctuations emanated from his body, and a brilliant golden light enveloped him. Five time law artifacts appeared around him, each representing a different aspect of time.

Han Li activated the "Great Five Elements Fantasy" technique, and the five time law artifacts flew out, each occupying a different position on the barrier. The barrier's surface began to ripple and distort, as if it were a lake's surface.

Han Li raised a finger and lightly poked the barrier, causing it to shatter like a bubble.

In an instant, the spiritual energy, miasma, and toxic fog from the surrounding area surged towards the island.

The island itself was like a stormy sea, with trees that had stood for countless years shaking violently. The birds perched on the trees were swept away by the sudden influx of miasma, and they fell to the ground.

"Amazing... it's so fast," the ghost witch said, seemingly impressed.

Han Li didn't explain, but simply said, "Let's go," and flew towards the island. Jin Tong and Qiuhun followed closely behind.

The island was desolate, with only ancient trees and no signs of buildings or pavilions. However, as soon as they landed, Han Li sensed a faint time law fluctuation emanating from the center of the island, drawing him towards it.

The island's terrain was treacherous, with dense forests and thick underbrush. Han Li and his companions had to force their way through the underbrush to create a path.

As they climbed higher, the trees became less dense, and the air grew thinner. When they reached the summit, they found only a few short shrubs and wild grasses.

Han Li spotted a broken stone monument half-buried in the wild grass.
