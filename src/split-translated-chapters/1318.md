Xiao Zhao, is there something wrong?" Li Hai asked, leading the young man to the side of the teahouse.

"Li shopkeeper, my mother's meridian has been acting up again with cold poison, I want to buy another packet of Red Sun tea," the young man said, lowering his head.

"Alright, wait a moment, I'll get it for you." Li Hai nodded and turned to enter the shop.

The young man looked at Li Hai's back, wanting to say something but stopping himself, and finally lowered his head deeply.

Soon, Li Hai came out with a red jade box in his hand.

"According to my previous instructions, drink it three times and it will suppress the cold poison." Li Hai handed the box to the young man.

"Thank you, Li uncle, but these years I've spent all my family's silver treating my mother's illness, there's not enough left...". The young man said, taking out a few small pieces of silver from a patched cloth bag.

"I know your family's situation, take this box back and give it to your mother to drink, if you need more, just come back." Li Hai smiled slightly, not taking the silver from the young man's hand.

"Li uncle..." The young man's eyes reddened, biting his lip tightly, but tears still fell.

"Alright, men don't cry easily, hurry back, your mother is waiting for you." Li Hai patted the young man's shoulder and turned to go back to the teahouse.

The young man wiped away his tears and suddenly knelt down, knocking his head on the ground twice, then stood up and left.

Inside the teahouse, Han Li's face showed a look of surprise.

He and Zi Ling were sitting in a place separated from the young man by a wall, but this wall couldn't block Han Li's senses.

Han Li had already made some progress in cutting down evil corpses, and his senses were more sensitive to good intentions, so he clearly sensed that when the young man thanked Li Hai, a formless good intention force appeared on Li Hai's body.

This good intention force was much stronger than what Han Li had gained from his previous good deeds.

"How is this possible? Why did Li Hai gain so much good intention, what's the difference between him and me?" Han Li's mind was racing, trying to figure out the reason.

He stared at the water cup in his hand, his breathing quickening, feeling like he was about to find the answer, and with a slight effort, he could break through the thin layer of paper.

"Ah!" At this moment, Zi Ling, who was reading a book, suddenly let out a soft exclamation.

"What's wrong?" Han Li looked over.

"Brother Han, look here, this book 'Li Yuan Zhai Ji' is written by a Confucian scholar, and there's a sentence here that's related to your good deeds." Zi Ling handed the book to Han Li, pointing to a passage.

Han Li looked and saw that it said: "Doing good is not a bad thing, but if you have a desire for fame, you'll invite criticism and trouble, be careful, be cautious."

A flash of insight struck Han Li's mind, and the thin layer of paper in his mind shattered, and he suddenly understood.

"I understand now! When doing good, if you have a desire for gain, it's not true good, no matter how much you do, it's still deviating from your true heart, only when you have no other thoughts, no desire for reward, is it truly great good." Han Li let out a deep breath, saying this.

Li Hai, although a great cultivator, had long since seen through the cultivation world and had retired to this small town, helping the young man was a pure and selfless act, without any desire for reward, and this good deed was a natural and effortless thing, which was why he gained so much good intention force.

Han Li's first time helping the storytelling grandfather and grandson was also an impulsive act, belonging to the same category.

"Originally, Brother Han, you did many good deeds, but they were all intentional, with a desire for merit, that's why you didn't gain much good intention force." Zi Ling was also a clever person, and as soon as Han Li mentioned it, she immediately understood.

"Now that I know the reason, it's easy to do." Han Li's face showed a smile, and his worries of many days were swept away.

Seven years later.

In a secluded place in Xiang County, a new owner took over a shop, a young couple who changed the original general store into a medical hall, selling medicine and treating patients.

This couple was young, but their medical skills were extremely high, not only could they cure ordinary illnesses, but also many difficult and complicated cases, with remarkable results.

Moreover, their consultation fees were very low, and soon their reputation spread throughout the abandoned city.

At one time, the small medical hall was crowded with people.

This couple was naturally Han Li and Zi Ling, and with their current cultivation level, treating these ordinary people's illnesses and some complicated cases was no trouble at all.

Before this, Han Li had spent seven years living as an ordinary person in this small town, trying to forget his own selfish thoughts, and even his identity as a cultivator.

Later, he used the silver he had saved up over the years to buy the shop and open a medical hall, treating patients with a sincere and selfless heart.

But this selfless heart was not something that could be reached easily.

He still had selfish thoughts, and the good intention force didn't descend.

Out of a hundred times, he could only maintain a selfless heart one or two times.

But Han Li didn't get anxious, continuing to treat patients and ponder the true meaning of good deeds.

This medical hall quickly became a well-known place, and the young couple inside became a middle-aged couple.

Time flew by, and thirty years passed, and the couple from back then gradually grew old.

Slowly, Han Li's heart became purer, and the times he treated patients with a selfless heart increased, gaining more good intention force, and his senses became more sensitive to good corpses.

(Note: Some sentences were adjusted to improve grammar and clarity, while maintaining the original meaning.)
In the blink of an eye, over a hundred years had passed.

This medicine shop had become a century-old store, a renowned old brand within a thousand miles, and the person in charge had changed several times.

Inside the medicine shop, Han Li sat cross-legged, his eyes closed, his expression serene, and a layer of lustrous light flashing on his face, like the Buddha's auspicious sign.

Zi Ling stood beside him, silently watching Han Li.

Her expression also had a subtle glow, and her demeanor was even more elegant.

Over the years, she had followed Han Li, doing many good deeds, and had received many blessings, although her cultivation had not made any significant progress, her soul had made significant progress.

After a long time, Han Li opened his eyes, and the inner room seemed to flash with two lightning bolts.

"Brother Han, is everything ready?" Zi Ling asked softly.

"The good corpse's response has been completed, and I have already grasped the true meaning of 'goodness'. With my divided corpse slaying technique, I have an 80% chance of slaying the good corpse," Han Li said.

"That's good," Zi Ling breathed a sigh of relief.

Han Li looked at the medicine shop, which he had been in for over a hundred years, and although his cultivation was already extremely high, he couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia.

"Let's go," he shook his head, and together with Zi Ling, they quietly left the medicine shop.

At this moment, the sky was still not fully lit, and there were no patients arriving.

"Brother Han, Sister Zi Ling, are you two leaving?" a voice came from outside, and it was the owner of the tea shop, Li Hai.

"Brother Li, these years have been a great help," Han Li bowed respectfully.

He was sincere in his gratitude, and if it weren't for Li Hai, he wouldn't have discovered the problem with his good deeds.

"Brother Han is too polite, these years, I haven't helped much, but I've received many pointers from Brother Han, and I'm grateful," Li Hai hurriedly returned the bow.

Over the past hundred years, Han Li had often visited Li Hai's tea shop to drink tea and chat.

Li Hai had initially decided to hide in the Heavenly Crane Domain, but with Han Li's guidance, he had rekindled his interest in cultivation, and Han Li's seemingly casual words had often brought him great benefits.

"I knew from the first time I met you two that you were no ordinary people, and I am far inferior to you. Your actions are beyond my understanding, but I wish you all the best in your future endeavors," Li Hai looked at Han Li and Zi Ling, his expression complex.

"I will come to your tea shop again someday, Brother Li," Han Li smiled and said.

"Anytime is welcome!" Li Hai was overjoyed, and he nodded repeatedly.

When he looked up, Han Li and Zi Ling's figures had already disappeared.

Li Hai looked at the empty streets, feeling a sense of melancholy, and he stood there for a long time before returning to the tea shop.

He looked at the quiet tea room, and his melancholy gradually dissipated.

Han Li and Zi Ling's world might be more exciting than the desolate city, but the peaceful life in the desolate city was also a kind of happiness.

Li Hai's face showed a satisfied expression, and he walked towards the inner room to prepare the spirit tea.

...

In the Heavenly Crane Domain, in a nameless mountain range, a flash of lightning illuminated the air, and Han Li and Zi Ling's figures appeared.

"Is it here?" Han Li looked towards a towering mountain peak, and with a flick of his wrist, a golden sword aura shot out from his fingertips, piercing the mountain wall like a hot knife through butter.

The sword aura seemed to come alive, moving through the mountain wall, and after a few breaths, it excavated a cave.

"This place has very thin spiritual energy, which might be unfavorable for you to slay the good corpse," Zi Ling said, her eyebrows slightly furrowed.

"It's not a problem, my cultivation has reached a point where I can absorb spiritual energy from multiple spaces, and the thin energy here doesn't affect me. Moreover, I have a deep understanding of the true meaning of goodness, and my soul is in harmony with this domain, so the chances of success are higher," Han Li said.

"I see," Zi Ling said, enlightened.

Han Li then led Zi Ling into the cave, setting up layers of restrictions around the perimeter, and walked towards the innermost secret room.

"Brother Han," Zi Ling suddenly called out, her expression filled with concern.

Each time Han Li slew a corpse, it was a great test for his main body, and if he failed, it would cause immense harm to his main body.

"Don't worry, after so much effort, I'm 90% sure of success," Han Li grasped Zi Ling's hand, smiling confidently.

Zi Ling was infected by Han Li's confidence, and she nodded heavily.

Han Li released Zi Ling's hand, and walked into the secret room.

With a loud "boom", the secret room door closed, and a layer of golden light appeared on the surface, completely isolating it from the outside.
