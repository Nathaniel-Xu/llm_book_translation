At this moment, countless golden light points appeared on the walls of the grand hall, flashing and extinguishing.

Suddenly, all the light points burst into a brilliant golden light, weaving together to form a thick golden light screen that enveloped the entire hall, including the floor and ceiling. The light screen was so dense that it seemed to have a physical presence, and its surface rippled with golden light waves, giving off an aura of unshakeable solidity.

The space within the grand hall became increasingly condensed, and its connection to the outside world was completely severed, forming a completely independent void.

At the same time, the flame on the altar's Years God Lamp surged again, its color changing to a golden hue, and the temporal laws it emitted became even stronger.

With a loud "whoosh", nine dragon-shaped flames shot out from the lamp's flame, pouncing towards Han Li and his companion.

Qimozi, who had been burned once before, didn't dare to entangle himself with these obviously more powerful dragon-shaped flames, and immediately retreated backwards.

Han Li was shocked by the changes around him, but his movements didn't slow down at all. He retreated even faster than Qimozi, flashing out of the area and landing on the ground several hundred feet away.

As soon as they landed, the nearby Dao soldiers swarmed towards them.

Although Han Li and his companions had broken through the Dao soldiers' formation, there were still many soldiers left, but without the formation's support, their power was greatly reduced.

Han Li grasped his sword seal and swung it, and a golden light flashed on his body. Innumerable sharp golden sword auras shot out from his body, exploding in all directions.

A series of dull sounds echoed through the air, and the nearby Dao soldiers were instantly knocked flying, clearing out a large area. However, more Dao soldiers continued to charge forward, undaunted.

"Brother Han, come here!" a voice called out.

Han Li looked over and saw that Huo San and Jiao San were standing with their backs against the wall of the grand hall, each holding a magical artifact that was repelling the Dao soldiers.

He moved his body and transformed into a golden light, flying over to join them.

"Brother Han, you're indeed powerful, but I wonder whose two life-bound tokens these are?" Huo San asked, his eyes fixed on the two blood-colored tokens in Han Li's hand.

Han Li looked at the tokens and saw that they were engraved with a small golden insect and a white horse, respectively.

Huo San's face fell, and he turned to look at Qimozi. Jiao San didn't look at Han Li's tokens, seemingly uninterested in them, and his eyes also turned towards Qimozi, a flash of strange light flickering in his gaze.

At this moment, Qimozi had already fallen to the ground near the five demonic creatures. His severed arm was still stained with a layer of golden light, which was writhing and spreading towards his shoulder, leaving a trail of charred flesh in its wake.

"Master, your arm!" Xiongshan exclaimed.

"It's just a minor injury, don't make a fuss!" Qimozi snorted, opening his mouth to spit out a small golden sword.

In an instant, the sword transformed into a golden light that wrapped around his shoulder, severing a small piece of flesh. The wound was covered by a layer of golden light, and not a single drop of blood flowed out.

As soon as the flesh was severed from his body, it "puffed" into a small cloud of ash that dispersed into the air.

Qimozi's face fell, and he flipped his hand to take out a fragrant green pill, which he swallowed. A green glow enveloped his severed arm, and a new arm condensed into existence, looking identical to the original.

Han Li shifted his gaze away from Qimozi and scanned the surrounding area, his mouth opening in a soft exclamation.

The Lanyue siblings were standing near the wall of the grand hall, fighting against the Dao soldiers.

However, Lei Yuzhe, Wen Zhong, and Su Shuqian were nowhere to be seen.

Han Li was about to cast a spell to search for them when the space above the altar suddenly fluctuated, and several figures appeared out of thin air. It was Lei Yuzhe, Wen Zhong, and Su Shuqian, along with a new figure â€“ an old man wearing a Daoist robe and a feathered crown, with a cold and gaunt face.

The old man held a golden talisman the size of a palm, engraved with a golden lamp pattern identical to the Years God Lamp. The talisman emitted a powerful temporal law that was identical to the lamp's.

The old man shook the talisman, and a golden light shot out, entering the Years God Lamp. The lamp's flame immediately shrank back to its original state.

The people in the grand hall were all stunned by this sudden turn of events.

"Could it be that you are the Sect Master of the Tongtian Sword Sect, Dao Yin Zhenren?" Jiao San asked, his eyes filled with a mix of awe and trepidation.

"Dao Yin Zhenren!"

The others heard the name and were shocked, their faces filled with a mix of fear and reverence. Even Lan Yuanzi and Lan Yanzhi's eyes flickered with a hint of fear as they quietly retreated a few steps.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he thought back to the information he had gathered about the Tongtian Sword Sect.
The Patriarch of the Tongtian Sword Sect, Dao Yin True Person, was renowned throughout the Jinyuan Immortal Realm, and his name was known to all. His reputation was even greater than that of the Palace Master of the Jinyuan Immortal Palace, Dongfang Bai.

This was not because of any other reason, but because Dao Yin True Person's cultivation had reached the Great Luo Realm, and his temperament was fierce and unyielding. He was known to be ruthless towards evil, and if one were to provoke him, he would not hesitate to disregard even the face of the Immortal Palace.

It was said that he had been in seclusion for many years, attempting to sever his mortal body and take his cultivation to the next level. It was unknown whether he had already succeeded.

But when did this Dao Yin True Person arrive here?

The entrance to the great hall had already been closed, and even a Great Luo existence could not easily sneak in. Or perhaps Dao Yin True Person was related to the black and white puppet woman from earlier?

However, Han Li stopped speculating, as Lei Yuze provided the answer.

He muttered to himself, raised his hand, and a silver light flashed before him, transforming into a spatial gate.

Han Li was familiar with this silver spatial gate, which was the exit of the spatial treasure.

The silver light flashed once, and three figures emerged from the spatial gate, standing at the top of the altar.

The three of them wore the attire of the Tongtian Sword Sect and appeared to be members of the sect.

The two men were an old man with a yellow face and a young man with red hair, while the woman was a beautiful young woman with a green crystal stone embedded in her forehead, giving her an otherworldly charm.

The three of them were not weak, and were all mid-stage Taiyi Realm cultivators.

"Lei Dao friend, I didn't expect you to have a spatial treasure on your person, hiding Dao Yin True Person and these fellow Daoists. What is the meaning of this?" Jiao San asked in a deep voice.

"Evil demons and heretics, you still dare to try to steal the treasure of our Jinyuan Immortal Realm? Today, this is the place of your downfall!" Lei Yuze did not speak, but Dao Yin True Person's face was filled with disdain as he swept his gaze across the people in the hall, his voice cold and detached.

Before he had finished speaking, he raised his sleeve, and a light flashed before him, producing a jade disk the size of a face basin.

The disk was divided into five sections, each with a different color: gold, green, blue, red, and yellow. Each section was inscribed with numerous talismans, and it appeared to be a treasure.

The crowd saw this and retreated several steps, their bodies radiating various colors of light as they revealed their guard.

But Qi Mozi saw the five-colored disk and revealed a look of surprise, raising his sleeve.

A light flashed before him, and another five-colored disk appeared, almost identical to the one in front of Dao Yin True Person.

Dao Yin True Person saw Qi Mozi's actions and a hint of mockery appeared on his lips. He pinched his fingers together, and his mouth began to chant a obscure incantation.

The five-colored disk in front of him immediately radiated a dazzling light, with the colors gold, green, blue, red, and yellow swirling around each other.

Qi Mozi also pinched his fingers together, attempting to activate his five-colored disk, but it remained still, his face changing color.

A loud rumbling sound shook the ground near the altar, and five massive jade pillars, each over a hundred feet tall, erupted from the ground. Each pillar was inscribed with dense array patterns.

Lei Yuze and Su Zhongyan immediately flew out, landing on the gold and blue pillars respectively.

The yellow-faced old man, the red-haired young man, and the beautiful young woman also flew out, landing on the yellow, red, and green pillars.

Only Wen Zhong remained, standing behind Dao Yin True Person with a look of nonchalance.

He gazed at the five people on the pillars, particularly Lei Yuze, and a hint of jealousy and dissatisfaction flashed in his eyes.

After the five of them sat down, they began to rapidly pinch their fingers together, and a dense array of talismans poured into the pillars beneath them.

The array patterns on the pillars radiated a brilliant light, and then a loud rumbling sound shook the air as the five pillars merged into five massive beams of light, shooting towards the sky and emitting a deafening roar that echoed throughout the great hall.

A massive energy erupted from the five-colored beams, sweeping towards the surroundings and creating a storm that ravaged the air. The stable void nearby began to distort and ripple.

The Dao soldiers in the great hall were like fallen leaves in a hurricane, swept up by the storm and crashing into the walls.

Han Li and the others stumbled backward, their faces pale, and were only stopped by the palace walls.

Only Qi Mozi remained standing, his face looking terrible as he rapidly pinched his fingers together, attempting to activate his five-colored disk, but it remained still.

"Don't be delusional, your five-element wheel may have been able to control the previous array, but it's impossible to control the current five-element void array!" Dao Yin True Person sneered.

"You've changed the structure of the array when you repaired the array eye!" Qi Mozi suddenly realized, his face pale.

"You're not stupid, but we've long expected that as soon as the Taishang Immortal Mansion appeared, the Heavenly Court would definitely send someone to intervene. How could we not have prepared?" Dao Yin True Person laughed loudly, his hands moving faster.

The five-colored pillars radiated an increasingly brilliant light, and the colors began to connect with each other.
