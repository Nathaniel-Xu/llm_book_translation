"You too, enter the temple."

Han Li heard White Ze's words, and a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes.

The Barbarian tribes were even more shocked, and they couldn't believe their ears. One by one, they exclaimed in shock.

For them, the Barbarian Holy Temple was an even more sacred existence than the Holy Mountain, and it was the center of their faith. If allowing Han Li, a human, to ascend the mountain was already a betrayal of their faith, then allowing him to enter the temple would be a desecration of their faith.

This was something they could not accept.

Even Li Qi Ma's face changed, and a hint of puzzlement flashed in his eyes.

"Your Majesty, this is unacceptable..." At this time, the Hun Meng tribe leader's face changed, and he shouted loudly.

"The Barbarian Holy Temple cannot be entered by humans..." The other tribe leaders also shouted one after another.

"Allowing humans to enter the temple is a desecration of our ancestors' bloodline, it's absolutely unacceptable..."

"Think carefully!"

The Zuo Wu tribe young master and Qing Tian also changed their expressions, and their eyes became extremely complex. They had not expected that the True Spirit King would value Han Li so highly, and they couldn't help but hesitate, wondering if they should still seek revenge against him.

Listening to the intense opposition, Han Li's expression also changed, and he hesitated.

"This Barbarian Holy Temple was established by me and the other seven True Spirit Kings. Who can enter, who cannot enter, I will decide." White Ze merely frowned and glanced at them, speaking calmly.

"Your Majesty..." The crowd's shouts were still echoing, but White Ze had already turned and left.

Li Qi Ma and the others immediately followed him, and Han Li hesitated for a moment before following as well.

As they entered the stone temple, the noisy voices behind them were still echoing, but once the heavy temple doors closed, all the sounds were blocked outside.

The interior of the temple was dimly lit, with only a fire pit in the center, and the flames danced and flickered, casting eerie shadows on the walls.

Han Li looked around and saw that the surrounding area was lined with tall stone statues, eight in total, each representing a True Spirit King: Chu Gan, Zhu Yan, Luo Hou, White Ze, Mountain Giant Ape, You Tian Kun Peng, Nine-Tailed Fox, and Mo Yan Pi Xi.

In front of each statue, there was a stone chair, but they were all empty, having been vacant for an extremely long time.

Liu Le'er gazed at the statue of the Nine-Tailed Fox, looking at its nine tails, and feeling a subtle connection to it. Her eyes flashed with a hint of confusion.

Xiao Bai stared intently at the statue of the Mo Yan Pi Xi, looking at its appearance, which was similar to his own, but he couldn't feel any sense of familiarity or closeness.

The other people also looked at the statues, each with a mix of curiosity, reverence, excitement, and longing.

"What you see before you are the statues of the eight True Spirit Kings, who have been the rulers of the Barbarian world since ancient times. Some were my close friends, while others were my sworn enemies. We built this Barbarian Holy Temple together to seal the Blood Gate of the Asura. Now, I have gathered you here to use the True Spirit King bloodline within you to unlock the seal." White Ze's eyes scanned the statues, and he spoke calmly.

"We are willing to obey your orders." The crowd responded in unison.

"Among the eight True Spirit Kings, except for Luo Hou and You Tian Kun Peng, who left the Eight Desolate Mountains to wander the void shortly after the temple was established, the others have all suffered twists of fate, and their destinies are unknown. It is unclear whether they still exist or have disappeared entirely." White Ze spoke without hesitation, revealing the secrets of the Barbarian True Spirit Kings.

For the people present, the ancestors who had given them their bloodline were already like mythical figures, but it was difficult for them to accept the fact that these ancestors, who had brought them great honor, were no longer alive.

So, after hearing White Ze's words, almost everyone's face turned serious.

"However, you don't have to be disappointed. As the chosen ones of heaven and earth, born with various innate divine abilities and heavenly laws, even if we disappear from the world, our bloodline powers will merge with the laws of time and will not be completely lost. When the Blood Gate of the Asura is opened, these powers will return to the temple. As the inheritors of their bloodline, you may inherit their powers and become the new True Spirit Kings!" White Ze continued.

As soon as he spoke, the crowd's hearts were like thunder, and their minds were in turmoil.

Become the new True Spirit Kings?

For all the Barbarian tribes, this was probably the ultimate temptation in the world.

At this moment, they were already confused, and they didn't know whether to hope for the return of the True Spirit Kings or to hope that they had already disappeared.

White Ze's eyes were calm, and he observed the changes in everyone's expressions without any reaction.

In fact, he was aware of all the changes in their thoughts and feelings, but he didn't care.

Because, for him, none of this was important.
The flame in the fire pit before you, is the essence fire lit by us eight, which has now weakened significantly, indicating that some people have truly disappeared from the world. All the descendants of the barbarian tribes, come forward and listen to the order. Bai Ze gave the order.

Everyone heard the sound, and they all walked forward, surrounding the fire pit in the center.

Only Han Li was slightly distant from them, standing behind Xiao Bai, silently observing everything.

The people present, seeing Han Li being so tactful, slightly reduced their hostility towards him, but in their eyes, Han Li's presence here was still a redundant and humiliating thing for the sacred temple.

But with the presence of the True Spirit King, no one dared to openly express it.

Bai Ze's gaze swept over the crowd, his eyes suddenly locked onto something, and his hands clasped together in front of him, a golden light rippling out from his palms, like a stone thrown into a lake, expanding outward in layers.

The golden light started from the bottom of the fire pit, spreading outward, and the ground was filled with blooming golden flowers.

Everyone saw this, and subconsciously retreated backward.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, looking down at the ground, and saw that the golden flowers were actually formed by dense symbols.

The symbols emitted a strange aura, and when everyone sensed it, they felt their blood vessels connecting with it, and their feet seemed to be rooted to the ground, merging with the earth.

Han Li's legs stiffened, and then he realized that he was also connected to the earth like the others.

Initially startled, Han Li quickly discovered that this power was not an external force binding him, but rather his own blood vessels being stirred, and the attractive force of the connection to the earth.

If he were to forcibly sever this connection, it wouldn't be impossible, but after a brief hesitation, Han Li decided to maintain this connection, because he could clearly feel the True Spirit blood vessels in his body, which seemed to be very fond of this connection.

As the symbols bloomed, the ground began to emit a golden glow, like a layer of gold dust, filling the entire hall, and illuminating the surroundings.

The eight True Spirit King statues were covered in a layer of golden dust, and the entire hall was bathed in a bright light, making it seem like the statues were standing like divine beings.

Bai Ze saw this, and a hint of nostalgia flashed in his eyes, as he walked to his statue and sat down slowly.

"Now, each of you take a drop of your original essence blood, and pour it into the fire pit," he said.

Everyone heard this, and without hesitation, they stretched out their hands, and a drop of their original essence blood emerged from their palms.

The sound of the blood dripping into the fire pit echoed through the hall.

As the blood containing the eight True Spirit King's blood vessels fell into the dark red fire pit, the flames suddenly surged, and a series of illusory shadows appeared within.

Han Li's gaze swept over, and he saw that the flames were actually displaying the true forms of the eight True Spirit Kings.

Before he could react, the fire pit flashed, and eight flames shot out, each heading towards one of the statues, and entering their brow points.

The statues then violently shook, and their surfaces burst with colorful lights, illuminating the entire stone hall.

At the same time, the ancient paths on the Eight Wastes Mountain began to shine with a brilliant light, filling the sky.

The night sky above the mountain, the entire void, was filled with the massive illusory shadows of the eight True Spirit Kings, occupying the eight directions, some roaring, some running, each one fierce and majestic.

The people of the various tribes, who were on the mountain peak, and the cultivators who were halfway up the mountain, saw this scene, and all knelt down, bowing their heads, and praying.

The peak's heavenly bell and the mountain's Kui beast drum, which had no one playing them, suddenly began to sound, and the ancient barbarian war song echoed through the heavens, a powerful and majestic aura spreading from the mountain peak.

The people in the city below, from the streets to the mansions, all knelt down, praying, and the entire city was filled with the sound of their voices.

At this moment, a sudden change occurred!

The illusory shadow of the mountain giant ape, which had appeared in the sky, suddenly became distorted, and then disappeared.

Corresponding to this, the sacred flame that had entered the mountain giant ape's statue, began to tremble, and then disappeared.

The golden dust on the statue also scattered, and the entire statue darkened.

Immediately, a series of chain reactions occurred, the flames on the other statues began to fly back, returning to the dark red fire pit, and the statues gradually darkened.

The people on the square saw this, and were shocked, their eyes fixed on the long-browed old man of the mountain ape tribe, the collapse of the True Spirit King's form starting from the mountain giant ape, clearly indicating that the bloodline successor chosen by the True Spirit King was not qualified.

The people's eyes were filled with anger, and they glared at the old man, their faces twisted with rage.
