E mo's heart was filled with anxiety, his eyes blazed with fury, and his skin had turned a deep crimson under the relentless assault of the Four Images Great Array.

"Halt!"

With a loud bellow, he crouched down like a coiled bow, storing up energy before suddenly bursting upwards, attempting to break through the Four Images Great Array from above.

However, the moment he leaped up, the Xuan Wu's invisible force burst forth, its power surging wildly. The Zhu Que above it fiercely spewed flames, which adhered to E mo's body, searing his internal organs.

E mo's brow was furrowed deeply, but he was undaunted, his only thought being to escape and prevent the resurrection of the saint's corpse.

Just as he was gathering strength, Sha Xin raised his hand, and a golden arc shot out from his palm, emitting a "zila" crackling sound. A golden armored puppet emerged, its entire body radiating electric light.

The puppet was robust and imposing, about five feet tall, with an intricate network of mystic symbols on its armor. Its face was completely concealed behind a thick mask, and in its hand was a massive golden shield.

As soon as the golden puppet appeared, it sprang forward, crashing down on E mo from above like a falling mountain, smashing into him just as he was trying to break through the Zhu Que's flames.

"You stupid fool, get out of my way!"

E mo roared, hurling a fist at the puppet, but it had already pressed the shield against its chest, meeting E mo's blow head-on.

The impact produced a massive shockwave, echoing through the air with a low rumble, its power rivaling that of the great mountains. E mo felt a massive energy coursing through his arm as the puppet countered his blow, forcing him to stop in mid-air, then sending him crashing to the ground.

The golden puppet was also sent flying, its body thrashing about in mid-air, but before it could fall, a new gold shadow appeared in the Four Images Killing Array, untethered by the four symbols' influence. It flashed back and forth beside E mo, its speed breathtaking.

As soon as E mo landed, he threw a punch at the air behind him, sending a massive shockwave through the void, expelling the blistering fog and wind blades. However, the golden shadow darted past him, immediately appearing above his head, its body transforming into a golden puppet.

This time, however, it was only three feet tall and wore light golden armor, its hands grasping a massive golden sword. The blade was almost as long as its own body, and the puppet lunged forward with a swift, powerful thrust.

E mo spun around, his fists swinging towards the puppet, the force erupting from his body spurring the power within. An uncontrollable explosion of starlight erupted from his fist, a burst of energy forcing back the boundless swathing fog and wind blades as if he were repelling the approaching darkness.

The puppet quickly changed tack, adopting a defensive stance as it raised the blade, letting out a long whooshing sound as E mo's mighty force struck the sword, sending the puppet tumbling backwards into the void.

By the time it managed to break free of E mo's attack, the shield-wielding puppet had already repositioned itself and safely received it in hand. As they moved in tandem, the agile puppets merged into a single, cohesive entity.

"Hmph! You've pushed me this far? I'll make you all pay!" E mo snarled in anger.

With a sudden crackle, he pressed two fingers to his brow, meeting a bright crimson hue blazing near his forehead, casting fierce licks of red light that undulated until his aura took on a drastic transformation.

"Quickly! Full strength, suppress him â€“ absolutely cannot let him get away...!" Sha Xin exclaimed as he saw E mo's transformation.

While this happened, Han Li watched from next to the water crystal coffin, observing Sha Xin as he shouted.

But next to E mo, a sudden change occurred! An unforeseen shift, E mo's entire body sounded loudly resonating sounds at every point, but instead of a tranquil snowy-white glow, his meridians flared radiated massive red lights and an intimidating red darkness erupted. The skin was even more bizarre as large quantities of black veins crisscrossed his arms making them writhe around grotesquely.

The air swelled around him as tremendous pressure turned to fierce red mist flowing from outside, crushing the surrounding Four Images Great Array power into him.

Before anyone could resist, E mo jumped once again, but he stood after using a horse-stance on the ground.

The sound resonated like thunderclap exploding and space began shuddering with rapid and constant collisions of explosive booms...
The ground beneath Er Mi's feet suddenly trembled violently before collapsing in on itself, with the surrounding earth exploding outward and sending countless massive boulders flying in all directions.

In an instant, the area within a radius of several hundred feet was reduced to dust, while the surrounding earth beyond was reduced to a scene of intense friction, transforming into a sea of fire that swept across the land.

The four War Puppets of the Four Cardinal Directions were caught off guard and failed to dodge in time, stumbling backward as their bodies began to crack and shatter.

The Sword Puppet dodged behind the Shield Puppet, its body nimble and quick. The Shield Puppet, however, was knocked flying by the incoming wave of energy.

Throughout the Blood Lake, explosions continued to ring out, sending waves of blood several dozen feet high crashing towards the Holy Remains at its center.

Han Li's brow furrowed as the over four hundred acupuncture points on his body lit up. His body spun rapidly, and his arms trembled as he unleashed a punch like thunder.

The sound of the explosion shook the air!

Layer upon layer of dense fist silhouettes appeared, resembling a starry sky that pressed down on the surroundings, managing to push back the incoming blood waves and barely holding back the invading storm.

After a moment, all the commotion gradually subsided.

The golden palace at the top of the dome had completely collapsed, revealing the night sky.

Han Li's hands clenched into fists as he swept his gaze across the surroundings, taking in the desolate scene before him. The four War Puppets of the Four Cardinal Directions had been completely destroyed, their fragments mixed in with the rubble. The two Golden Armored Puppets were nowhere to be seen.

Just then, Han Li's pupils constricted as he spotted a lithe, feminine figure half-hidden amongst the rubble. Her face was exposed, and her beauty was breathtaking.

Her face was like white jade, and her eyes sparkled like water.

It couldn't be anyone else but Zi Ling.

Han Li's body flashed, and he appeared beside the woman, sweeping away the rubble and lifting her into his arms.

Looking at the unconscious Zi Ling, whose lower abdomen was pierced by flames and rubble, with blood trickling from her mouth and her brow furrowed in pain, Han Li felt a pang in his heart. If only he had recognized her earlier, she wouldn't have had to suffer like this.

As he thought this, Han Li leapt into the air, heading towards the other side of the Blood Lake.

After a few leaps, he landed beside Liu Tianzi and the others, gently laying Zi Ling down. He produced a medicinal pill from his robes and fed it to her, then turned to Liu Tianzi and said, "Please take care of her for a moment."

Liu Tianzi's expression was solemn, and she nodded without saying a word.

Bone Shatters, who lay nearby, gazed at Zi Ling with a complex look in his eyes.

Shi Chongxin, whose restraints had been removed by Liu Tianzi, was severely injured and could only sit on the sidelines, unable to participate in the fight.

"Thanks," Han Li said, before leaping towards the other shore.

He saw Er Mi approaching, his body radiating a purple-red glow, a blood mist surrounding him, as he grasped the neck of the already deceased Kun Yu.

Han Li's gaze swept over the scene, taking in Kun Yu's mangled body, his dantian exploded into a bloody crater, his head twisted to one side.

"Kid, everything has been part of my plan, but you're an anomaly! You've been disrupting my plans since the Weeping Blood Array. I must say, I admire your unorthodox methods, and I would have taken you as my disciple if you hadn't revived that corpse. Alas, today you must die..." Er Mi casually tossed Kun Yu's corpse aside, slamming it into a nearby stone wall.

"Er City Lord's offer is generous, but I, Li, will repay it with interest..." Han Li retorted, his voice cold and menacing.

As soon as he finished speaking, Han Li had already activated his Feathered Dragon Scales technique, disappearing from the spot in an instant.

Er Mi sneered, reacting to Han Li's disappearance by striking the air beside him.

A massive fist shook the air, as Er Mi's blow was so powerful that it caused the sound of thunder.

In the same instant, a golden light appeared beneath Er Mi's fist, but instead of Han Li, it was the Golden Armored Puppet holding a massive shield that materialized.

The shield rippled like water, as the gold-colored ripples overlapped, creating a sonic boom that shook the air.

The puppet, taking advantage of the momentum, used Er Mi's own strength against him, allowing it to withstand the blow.

The two of them stood frozen, facing off against each other.
