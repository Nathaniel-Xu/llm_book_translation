“Is he really Han Li? The one who can single-handedly kill his way into the Golden Source Sect and escape unscathed?” Su Zhi finally came back to her senses, muttering to herself.

Jin Liu's gaze fell on Han Li, becoming increasingly complex.

Lei Yu Ce glanced at Wen Zhong, shaking his head slightly, and the latter nodded in understanding, both of them watching from the sidelines without making a sound.

Su Zhi quickly regained her usual icy demeanor, not intending to speak.

Jiao San and Huo San naturally wouldn't say anything either.

She Qian swept her gaze across the group, finally settling on the Blue Yuanzi siblings.

“Please forgive us, Elder She. My brother and I have already sworn an oath that we will not attack Han Li in this Timeless Tower secret realm. If we need to take action, we will wait until we leave this place,” Blue Yuanzi said with a hint of difficulty, bowing his fist.

“Foolishness! In the face of such great righteousness, what need is there to follow such a trivial oath? Have you forgotten the purpose of pursuing this person?” She Qian emphasized the word "purpose" as she spoke.

Blue Yuanzi's expression changed slightly, but after a moment of hesitation, he maintained his bowed fist, refusing to rise.

Blue Yan also bowed her head, remaining silent.

“Fine, fine, fine... You Blue siblings are quite something. I'll make sure to report this to our sect's elder when I return, and your master will have to give an explanation,” She Qian said with a sarcastic tone.

Blue Yan's face changed, and she was about to stand up.

“Don't be afraid of violating orders. If we lose faith today, our master will be heartbroken,” Blue Yuanzi whispered, grabbing her sleeve.

Blue Yan settled back down, not making a move.

The others not helping was one thing, but even their own sect members refused to take action, leaving She Qian feeling embarrassed and humiliated. Her gaze swept over the siblings, her eyes cold and dark.

“Remember your choice today, and hopefully, you won't regret it in the future,” She Qian warned, her voice dripping with menace.

Jin Liu watched the scene unfold, a hint of amusement flickering in his eyes as he observed from the sidelines.

He knew that the angrier She Qian became, the more ruthless she would be towards Han Li, which was exactly what he wanted to see.

Han Li stood with his hands behind his back, his mind racing with strategies to deal with the yellow-robed woman, his expression unchanging. A faint smile even played on his lips.

“Let's see how long you can remain so calm,” Jin Liu thought to himself, a soft snort escaping his nose.

“Since you all have chosen to watch from the sidelines, then be good spectators and keep a safe distance,” the yellow-robed woman said, her body suddenly disappearing without warning, leaving behind a yellow glow.

The group retreated, keeping a safe distance.

The next instant, a strong gust of wind blew from behind Han Li, and a cloud of yellow sand erupted, surrounding him on all sides.

Han Li had anticipated this, and his True Essence Wheel reversed, allowing him to instantly disappear from the spot. The yellow sand landed on empty air.

As the sand settled, a yellow glow burst forth, and a screen of light expanded, enveloping the surrounding area within a hundred miles.

Han Li found himself trapped within, feeling a heavy pressure bearing down on him. The air seemed to thicken, and the ground transmitted a crushing force, as if multiple invisible mountains were pressing down on him.

In She Qian's spiritual domain, the yellow sand dunes shifted and transformed, revealing a series of low, winding mountains on the periphery. The air was desolate, with barely any signs of life.

Near Han Li's location, the ground was covered in a sea of yellow mud, with various shapes and sizes of yellow mud pits emerging. The surfaces of the pits were calm, but the air was filled with a noxious stench.

Han Li's nose wrinkled in distaste as he took in the smell.

Suddenly, a low, croaking sound echoed in his ears, and he turned to face the source.

A massive, house-sized toad head emerged from a nearby mud pit, its golden eyes fixed on Han Li. The toad's skin was covered in dense, wart-like protrusions, sending a chill down Han Li's spine.

Han Li's wrist twitched, and a burst of golden electricity flowed from his sleeve, summoning thirty-six bamboo swords that shot towards the toad.

“Zhilalala...”

The swords sliced through the air, their speed hindered by the spiritual domain's earth attribute laws, but their power and momentum remained unchanged.
As the flying sword approached, the sword light gathered, and the thunder and lightning flashed. Just as it was about to strike, the yellow toad suddenly leapt into the mud pit and disappeared.

Han Li quickly circulated his Lian Shen technique, urging his divine sense to search for the toad. However, he could only sense a vast and powerful earth attribute law force surrounding him, and he couldn't detect the toad's trail.

"It's using its own spiritual domain as cover, and its aura is completely merged. This is a bit tricky." Han Li's heart tightened, and his eyebrows furrowed as he muttered to himself.

Just as he finished speaking, he suddenly felt the ground beneath him violently tremble, and he was lifted into the air as the toad burst out from beneath him.

Han Li's expression remained unchanged as he raised his hand, and the 36 Qing Zhu Feng Yun swords immediately flew back to his side, forming a defensive perimeter around him.

However, just as the flying swords were about to reach him, he suddenly noticed a dark shape looming above him. A hundred-zhang-tall mountain peak was flying towards him, and it was about to crash down on his head.

If the mountain peak were an ordinary object, Han Li wouldn't have been afraid. But it was actually a product of the toad's spiritual domain, imbued with a dense earth attribute law force. Its weight was at least a thousand jun.

Han Li's eyebrows slightly furrowed as he pointed upwards, and the Qing Zhu Feng Yun swords immediately changed direction, flying towards the mountain peak.

As the mountain peak was about to crush Han Li, the 36 Qing Zhu Feng Yun swords emitted a sharp, piercing sound, and they stabbed into the base of the mountain peak. The swords' bodies glowed with a blue and gold light, and the thunder and lightning shadows burst forth.

The golden lightning filled the air, and the mountain peak was held in place by the golden lightning sea, preventing it from falling.

Han Li circulated his Tian Xia Zhen Yu Gong, and his body flipped downwards, assuming a posture as if he were descending from the heavens. He clenched his fist and prepared to strike.

The ground had already split open, revealing a massive crater, and a gigantic yellow toad was waiting at the bottom. Its mouth was open wide, and it was about to swallow Han Li whole.

Han Li's body fell rapidly, and in the span of a few breaths, he had already fallen into the toad's mouth.

The toad's eyes flashed with a cold light, and its jaws snapped shut, swallowing Han Li whole.

But at the same time, Han Li's fist had already gathered its power, and a starlight glow burst forth from his fist. He struck downwards with a mighty blow.

A deafening crash echoed through the air, and a brilliant white light erupted from the toad's mouth. The toad's jaws were torn open by a powerful gust of wind and a surge of energy, revealing a multitude of starlight beams.

The next moment, a thunderous explosion shook the air, and the massive yellow toad burst apart, revealing Han Li's figure once more.

As the yellow toad died, the surrounding environment underwent a sudden change. The spiritual domain's light curtain rapidly contracted, shrinking to a tenth of its original size. The light also began to fade, as if it would soon disappear.

At the same time, the mountain peak in the distance suddenly melted, transforming into a yellow-brown mud that fell from the sky like a rain of mud and stones.

Han Li was caught off guard, and he was splattered with mud. He raised his hand, and the Qing Zhu Feng Yun swords flew back to his side, returning to his body.

"How is this possible?" the people watching from a distance exclaimed, their faces filled with shock and incredulity. How could a powerful Da Luo like the toad be defeated so easily?

Among them, Jin Liu's expression changed the most, revealing a mix of disappointment and anger.

Just as they were about to react, another unexpected event occurred. Han Li's body, still suspended in mid-air, suddenly froze, as if he had been petrified. He fell to the ground with a thud.

"No!" Jiao San exclaimed, her brow furrowed as she rushed forward.

"You mustn't forget our mission! The bigger picture is more important..." Huo San chased after her, trying to stop her.

Jiao San's footsteps halted, and she gazed at Han Li from a distance.

The yellow mud that had fallen on Han Li's body had transformed into a layer of mud, encasing him in a shell that resembled a life-sized ceramic statue. However, this shell was different from an ordinary statue, as it was imbued with a powerful earth attribute law force, like a strong binding spell that sealed him within.

At first, Han Li's body seemed to struggle slightly, but as the mud shell's color deepened, his movements ceased.

As the mud shell dried and hardened, a small, mud-covered toad emerged from the mud pit, its body glowing with a yellow light. The toad transformed into a yellow-robed woman, who sneered at Han Li's statue-like form.

"Hehe, a mere Tai Yi boundary cultivator like you thinks you can stir up trouble? You're no match for me!" She glanced at Han Li's statue, her eyes filled with mockery.
