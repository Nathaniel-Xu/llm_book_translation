"Time is of the essence, let's enter the tower!"

Lei Yu Ce's voice was low and urgent, and his body swayed slightly as he moved to the entrance of the tower.

The others followed closely behind him.

Without the True Immortal realm cultivators, there were now fewer than five hundred people, and Han Li blended in with the crowd, following at a relatively safe distance.

At the same time, his eyes occasionally swept towards another direction, where two cultivators who seemed unremarkable were standing. The man had thick eyebrows, and the woman had a round face and cherry lips.

They were the ones Han Li had suspected of being the "Lan siblings".

Although he still couldn't confirm their true identities, he felt that even if they weren't the Lan siblings, they were still worth paying attention to.

Since the Taishu Fu secret realm had opened, the Golden Source Immortal Palace still didn't have a leader, but Han Li didn't think the Heavenly Court would really sit idly by. Since no one from the Heavenly Court had appeared yet, it was even more reason to be vigilant.

Lei Yu Ce stood at the base of the tower, his eyes scanning the surroundings before confirming that it was safe. He then raised his hand and pressed it against the stone door.

Before he could even use his energy to push the door open, the stone door emitted a low rumbling sound and automatically swung open, revealing a dark entrance. The light inside was dim, but there were faint flashes of firelight.

Lei Yu Ce was slightly surprised, but he quickly regained his composure and didn't rush in. Instead, he stood at the entrance and examined it carefully.

The others followed his lead, holding their breath as they gazed into the entrance. They also tried to send out their divine sense to investigate, but to no avail.

The tower's interior had a formless restrictive energy that could block all divine sense.

"This place is indeed a bit strange," Wen Zhong said with a chuckle. "Everyone should be careful. If anyone doesn't want to go in, it's still not too late."

However, since they had come this far, no one was willing to give up. Everyone's eyes turned back to Lei Yu Ce.

"Let's go!"

Lei Yu Ce said, taking a step forward into the tower.

The others followed, led by the Tongtian Sword Sect and the Tian Shui Sect.

As they entered the tower, they saw that the walls were adorned with fire lanterns, burning a type of oil that emitted a faint, pungent smell. The air was dimly lit, but there was no sign of smoke.

The tower's interior was empty, except for a massive, ten-meter-tall statue of a double-headed figure standing in front of them.

The statue was strange, with a smiling face on one side and a ferocious, evil face on the other. Its body was adorned with intricate carvings and lock-like armor, and it had two golden wings on its back. One hand held a golden ruyi, and the other held a massive axe, each pointing towards a different direction.

Below the ruyi and axe, two dark passageways led deeper into the tower. The light from the lanterns couldn't illuminate the inside of the passageways, making it impossible to see what lay within.

"Look, there are words on the ruyi and axe!" someone exclaimed.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he saw that the ruyi and axe each had a line of vertical text. He murmured, "Choose the path without regret, different roads lead to the same destination."

Lei Yu Ce also spoke up, repeating the words. He turned to ask, "What does this mean? What's the choice we're supposed to make?"

"It seems that choosing different paths will lead to different encounters," Jing Liu said, pausing for a moment. "Perhaps one path is treacherous, and the other is... even more treacherous."

"Dividing into two groups is actually a good idea," Su Zhenzi said, her eyes fixed on the statue. "Our Tian Shui Sect and your Tongtian Sword Sect can each lead a group, taking a different path."

Lei Yu Ce's eyes flashed, and he said, "Su Xianzi, this is the core of the immortal palace, and there are bound to be dangers inside. I think it's better if we don't split up."

Jing Liu hesitated, then transmitted a message to Su Zhenzi. "I know you don't want to travel with him, but what he said is true. If the statue says 'different roads lead to the same destination', then doesn't it mean that both paths are the same?"

Su Zhenzi's expression turned cold, and she replied, "Jing Shixiong, when did you become so naive? Just because the statue says so doesn't mean it's true. Maybe the Taishu Xianzi set up a trap, creating a dead end for intruders."

Jing Liu was taken aback, and he transmitted a message back. "You're right, but how do we choose which path to take? Do you see any clues?"

Su Zhenzi replied, "Both passageways have restrictions, and our divine sense can't penetrate them. We can only find out what's inside after we enter."

Lei Yu Ce asked again, "Su Xianzi, what do you think we should do?"

Su Zhenzi's expression was cold, and she said, "We can't just focus on our own sects. If we travel together, what about the other cultivators? Should we let them explore one of the passageways on their own?"

Lei Yu Ce hesitated, unsure of what to do.
Jin Liang smiled and said, "Lai Dao's good intentions, I'll take it for my junior sister. However, what my junior sister said is also reasonable. Since we've been made the leaders of the same path, we should take on the responsibility of leading."

Lei Yu Ce listened and said, "In that case, please let Su Xianzi choose a path first."

Tian Guan was on the left, and evil spirits were on the right... I'll choose the right path." Su Zhen Cai didn't hesitate and said.

"Good! Then our Tong Tian Sword Sect will take the left path. Ling Xiao Men, Qing Su Gu, Lie Guang Cheng, Mo Xiang Lou, and Wang You Ge's fellow practitioners, follow Su Xianzi to explore, and the rest will follow me." Lei Yu Ce said loudly.

The people behind him were also pondering the meaning of the statue, and they were hesitant about which path to take. However, since the leader of the alliance had spoken, and there were two major sects leading the way, no one had any objections.

Before long, the hundreds of people split into two groups and headed towards the two different paths indicated by the statue.

As they parted ways, Lei Yu Ce reminded Su Zhen Cai to be careful, but the latter didn't respond and led her group away.

Among the people from Wang You Ge, Lanyi and her brother were hidden in the crowd, their faces calm, but they were secretly transmitting sound.

"Little sister, this Lei Yu Ce is quite majestic, his boundary is comparable to Su Zhen Cai's, why is he always so cold and distant?" Lanyi asked in a transmission.

"What's strange about that? Whether it's a mortal or an immortal, as long as it's a man, isn't it all the same? The more unattainable, the more willing to pay with their heart, the colder Su Xianzi is, the more Lei Yu Ce will be willing to seek and be devoted." Lanyi smiled and replied.

"There's such a principle... it's like a clever move to entice and then let go." Lanyi's brother seemed to understand and nodded.

"How is that? Brother, you seem to have a taste for this." Lanyi's tone changed, and she asked.

"Ah... let's focus on the task at hand. What's to come is uncertain, so stick close to me." Lanyi's brother changed the subject.

At the end of the group, Han Li passed by the giant axe and looked up to see the words "Fallen Axe, Severing Long Life" written on the axe handle. He couldn't help but furrow his brow.

Almost at the same time, a young girl in black robes on the other path also looked up and saw the words "Like or Dislike" written on the Ruyi.

Both groups had entered the passageway for hundreds of meters when a loud "boom" sound suddenly came from behind.

It was the giant axe and Ruyi in the hands of the two-headed statue, which had fallen down and blocked the two paths, cutting off their return route.

The two groups heard the sound and stopped, and Wen Zhong and Jin Liang returned to investigate before returning to the group, saying that the retreat route was blocked and they had to press on.

The crowd was initially noisy, but since they had come to explore the treasure, they soon quieted down and continued on their way.

Han Li, who was at the back of the group, listened to the sound and a thoughtful expression flashed across his face.

As they continued on their way, the group led by Tian Shui Zong walked along the passageway for over ten miles, and the stone walls on either side were filled with intricate carvings of various symbols. However, they were too chaotic and disorganized, and Han Li couldn't make sense of them.

As they walked further in, the passageway began to narrow, from several hundred meters wide to several dozen meters wide.

Initially, the crowd was cautious, expecting sudden changes or mechanisms, but as they walked, the passageway seemed to be getting narrower, and there were no other changes, not even a single mechanism.

However, the more they walked, the more uneasy they felt, and the atmosphere became tense.

As they reached the end of the passageway, a gigantic golden gate appeared before them, with two statues of gods holding spears on either side, their faces stern and imposing.

The crowd's attention was drawn to the statues, but only a few people noticed the door nails on the gate.

"Yin and Yang, ten returns nine exits... it seems to be a Yin-Yang lock array." Jin Liang, who was at the front, pointed to the gate and said.

Han Li listened and couldn't help but sneer.

The door nails on the gate did have a Yin-Yang pattern, with some protruding outward and others inward, forming a complex pattern. However, it wasn't referring to Yin-Yang, but rather the stars.

The protruding nails represented the Taiyang Palace, and the inward-facing nails represented the Taiyin Palace. Therefore, the true name of this mechanism was the Star Palace Confrontation Array, and the Yin-Yang lock array was just a superficial name.

"Brother, since you recognize it, can you unlock it?" Su Zhen Cai asked.

"I can try." Jin Liang nodded after a moment of thought.

He turned to the crowd and said loudly, "Everyone, please be quiet, I have something to announce."

The passageway fell silent, and all eyes were on him.
