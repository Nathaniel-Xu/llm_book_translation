At this moment, in a certain place in the Jinyuan Immortal Realm, a dark green flying boat streaked across the sky, heading towards the front with incredible speed.

The flying boat was vaguely shaped like a dragon, as if a dark green dragon was soaring through the sky. Its speed was so fast that it was almost impossible to comprehend, and it covered a distance of tens of thousands of miles in the blink of an eye. Cultivators with lower cultivation levels couldn't even detect the flying boat's trail.

Inside the flying boat sat two figures, Han Li and Lan Yan, but they had changed their appearances.

This dark green flying boat was one of the treasures Han Li had obtained from Xi Zhan's storage magical instrument. When Xi Zhan self-destructed his demonic dan, his body was reduced to ashes, but Han Li managed to snatch the storage magical instrument at the critical moment.

This flying boat was a wood and wind dual-attribute magical instrument, and its rank was not low. It had already reached the sixth-rank magical instrument level, and not only was its flying speed extremely fast, but it also possessed strong concealment properties, surpassing any flying boat Han Li had previously owned.

Lan Yan stood at the front, controlling the flying boat's progress.

Han Li had set up a restriction within Lan Yan's body, allowing him to sense her every move, so he wasn't afraid of her causing any trouble.

He sat at the rear of the flying boat, crossed his legs, and cultivated, with golden light flashing around him. The power of the time laws surged within him.

After more than three years of rest and recuperation, Han Li's internal power of the time laws had recovered to a small extent, which made him feel somewhat at ease.

He held a few jade slips in his hand, and his divine sense was probing within them.

After a long time, Han Li withdrew his divine sense, and his expression turned somewhat solemn.

These jade slips were the materials he had collected from the Wheel of Reincarnation, related to the Jinyuan Immortal Realm and the Jiuyuan Observatory.

He had collected a lot of information about the Jinyuan Immortal Realm, but the Jiuyuan Observatory was extremely strict in its management, and very little information had been leaked out. He had tried his best to find more, but only managed to gather some scattered and useless information.

"Lan Yan, don't bother controlling the flying boat for now. I have something to ask you," Han Li said, looking at Lan Yan in front of him.

"I don't know what Han Li wants to ask," Lan Yan replied, stopping her control of the flying boat and walking over to Han Li.

Along the way, Lan Yan had been extremely obedient, not saying anything she shouldn't say, and not doing anything she shouldn't do. She had been following Han Li's orders faithfully.

"I want to know some information about the Jiuyuan Observatory," Han Li asked directly.

"Please ask, Han Li. I will definitely tell you everything I know," Lan Yan replied, her beautiful eyes flashing.

"Your answer is quite straightforward, Lan Yan. As far as I know, the Jiuyuan Observatory's rules are extremely strict, and leaking the sect's secrets is a serious offense. Aren't you afraid?" Han Li raised an eyebrow.

"Your strength is far beyond mine, Han Li. Even if I refused to answer, you would still be able to find out through other means. So, I might as well cooperate with you. I only hope that you can keep it a secret that I told you this information," Lan Yan replied in a low voice.

"You and your senior brother are quite similar, Lan Yan. Don't worry, as long as you answer my questions honestly, I won't trouble you," Han Li said, nodding.

Lan Yan's expression flashed with a hint of sadness when Han Li mentioned Lan Yuanzi, but it quickly disappeared, and she nodded her head in gratitude.

"According to rumors, the Jiuyuan Observatory has a Dao Ancestor sitting in power. How many Dao Ancestors are there?" Han Li asked.

"Dao Ancestors are extremely rare. Even though our Jiuyuan Observatory is a major sect in the True Immortal Realm, we only have one Dao Ancestor, who is the founder of our sect," Lan Yan replied.

"What about the number of Da Luo Realm cultivators?" Han Li asked, nodding.

"My cultivation level is not low, but I'm not a core disciple of the Jiuyuan Observatory. I'm just a scattered cultivator who joined later and was assigned to be a Shadow Guard, executing secret missions. My position in the sect is not high, and I don't know much. However, as far as I know, there are fifteen Da Luo Realm cultivators in the Jiuyuan Observatory, including the sect master, two deputy sect masters, four great envoys, and eight great elders. However, the Jiuyuan Observatory has many secrets, so there might be other Da Luo Realm cultivators," Lan Yan said.

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise when he heard this.

The Jiuyuan Observatory actually had so many Da Luo Realm cultivators! No wonder Jiao San had told him to increase his strength before rescuing his friend. With his current strength, rushing into the Jiuyuan Observatory would be like throwing an egg against a rock.

"What about the strength of the cultivators who were sent to capture me? What is their position in the sect?" Han Li asked, thinking for a moment.

"Miao Fa Xian Zun is one of the four great envoys of the Jiuyuan Observatory. He has already severed one of his corpses and has reached the middle stage of the Da Luo Realm," Lan Yan replied.

"Middle stage of the Da Luo Realm..." Han Li's pupils constricted.
After entering the Great Luo realm, every advancement in realm would bring about a drastic change in power, and with his current multitude of methods, facing a Great Luo realm early-stage cultivator, as long as the opponent wasn't too powerful, he could hold his own using his mastery of the time law combined with various methods. However, facing a Great Luo realm mid-stage cultivator was a completely different story.

He immediately asked Lan Yan some questions, and Lan Yan answered in detail, allowing Han Li to gain a preliminary understanding of the Nine Yuan Sect.

The more he understood, the more Han Li's heart chilled.

The Nine Yuan Sect's power was far beyond his expectations, and it was not comparable to the previous few immortal palaces. It was a truly massive entity, and rescuing Jin Tong from it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, with just his own strength.

However, no matter how difficult it was, he had never thought of retreating. He was determined to rescue Jin Tong.

Han Li finished asking his questions and sent Lan Yan to continue controlling the flying boat. He then sat down cross-legged and began to cultivate the "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique", trying his best to recover the time law.

...

In the unknown distance, in the Zhongtu immortal realm, the Heavenly Court.

Countless towering immortal mountains stood upright, stretching to the horizon, with countless immortal pavilions on top of them. The mountains were connected by rainbow-colored bridges, and colorful auspicious clouds floated in the air. The palaces floated in mid-air, surrounded by immortal aura, and cranes flew about.

The various radiant lights emanating from the immortal mountains and pavilions were so bright that they seemed to push away the light from the sky, making it seem like this was the gathering place of all the light in the world, without a single shadow.

In a certain part of the Heavenly Court, a thick white cloud mist filled the air, constantly changing shape. Sometimes it condensed into giant dragons that fought each other, and sometimes it transformed into thousands of white horses that galloped by. It was as if it was a boundless white ocean, with waves crashing against the shore.

Above the white cloud mist, a massive palace stood like a city.

The palace was entirely white, with countless giant talismans inscribed on its walls, and some talismans seemed to be floating and dancing in the air. The palace was surrounded by many white-armored soldiers, each holding a weapon, and their bodies seemed to be made of white cloud mist.

Each soldier's aura was extremely powerful, rivaling that of a ordinary Taiyi cultivator. The weapons they held were of the highest quality, emitting a faint law fluctuation.

On the palace gate, which was hundreds of feet high, a golden plaque hung with the four characters "White Cloud Dao Palace" inscribed on it. The characters seemed to be floating and dancing, as if they might fly off the plaque at any moment.

Inside the palace, on the high platform, a white figure sat, but despite being close, its face and body were blurry and unclear, giving off an extremely ethereal feeling. It was as if its true body was in the depths of the void, and only a projection was visible.

A power that was almost comparable to the Heavenly Dao emanated from the white figure, filling the entire palace. Time and space seemed to be under its control.

At this moment, a person stood on the palace platform, a virtual body formed from golden flames. It was Qimozi.

"...I activated the Years God Lamp and used the residual soul mark left by the Years God to destroy the Stone Empty Ink, and the Years Tower collapsed. I heard that the Tongtian Sword Sect then detonated the entire Years God immortal realm space. Those people should not have been able to escape. However, Han Li, Liu Ziyin, and others are extremely powerful, and with the help of Stone Empty Ink, a Great Luo peak cultivator, they might have found a way to escape. I hope that you will send someone to the Jinyuan immortal realm to confirm their fate, in preparation for future events." Qimozi said respectfully to the white figure.

"I have received the report from the Tongtian Sword Sect, but they couldn't clarify some of the details. It seems that the situation was as you described. However, according to what you said, it was just a coincidence that you got involved in the Years God immortal realm?" A distant voice came from the white figure, without any emotion.

"Yes, the Heavenly Vessel was an item that the Supreme Lord ordered to be retrieved. I was chasing after Han Li to retrieve the vessel when I coincidentally encountered the Years God immortal realm. However, why did the Years God immortal realm appear in the small Jinyuan immortal realm, and why were there so many prisoners inside? I don't understand. Wasn't the Years God..."

The white figure suddenly interrupted Qimozi, "Don't ask about the Years God's affairs."

"Yes, I was wrong to ask," Qimozi said hastily, his heart trembling.

"With your current strength, why couldn't you retrieve the Heavenly Vessel?" the white figure asked again.

"Han Li, although he is still in the Taiyi realm, has already mastered the 'Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique', which can counter my 'Time-Cutting Flame Collection'. Moreover, he has also comprehended the 'Five Elements Phantom World' divine ability. At that time, the Years God immortal realm's Wheel of Rebirth and the Barbarian Realm's powers were also involved. I was unable to retrieve the Heavenly Vessel and was even destroyed by them. Please, Supreme Lord, punish me for my failure!" Qimozi's eyes flashed with a hint of pain as he said this.

"Was it really because the opponent's strength was too great, or did you have ulterior motives and miss the opportunity? As far as I know, you have been searching for the 'Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique' for a long time and even sent your disciples to retrieve it."

The white figure's words were like a cold wind, and the temperature in the palace dropped suddenly.

"I was wrong to hide the truth! I did indeed want to obtain the 'Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique' from Han Li. However, I would never dare to prioritize my own interests over the Supreme Lord's affairs. This time, I truly failed because the opponent's strength was too great. Please, Supreme Lord, investigate and punish me!" Qimozi's face turned pale, and he knelt down, his voice trembling with fear.

The white figure's finger tapped gently on the armrest, and the silence in the palace seemed to grow thicker.

A massive pressure filled the palace, like a giant invisible beast.

Qimozi's face turned even paler, and his virtual body began to tremble.
