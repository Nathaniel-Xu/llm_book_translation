Dao Yin Zhenren slowly swallowed a golden pill, roughly stopping his injuries, and gazed at Wen Zhong.

Unexpectedly, the originally short-tempered and evil-hating him, now had no blame in his eyes, only pity.

At this moment, his figure suddenly blurred and disappeared from the original location, reappearing behind Wen Zhong.

Wen Zhong sensed it, his five fingers turned into claws, and he suddenly reached out to grab Dao Yin Zhenren's heart.

Dao Yin Zhenren's hand emerged, pressing down on Wen Zhong's arm, and pulling it down.

Wen Zhong felt a thousand pounds of pressure on his arm, and his entire body fell forward, landing on the ground.

Dao Yin Zhenren took advantage of the situation, bending down and lifting his other hand, pointing at Wen Zhong's right ear, and a crystal light like a steel needle pierced into it.

Wen Zhong, who was still struggling and roaring, suddenly froze, and then fainted.

Lei Yu Ce saw this scene, and his face relaxed, finally calming down.

But immediately, his face changed again, looking shocked at the broken altar's edge.

A black smoke suddenly appeared, swirling like a whirlwind, forming a black storm vortex, and a strong aura fluctuation was emanating from it.

Even Han Li, with his strong spiritual sense, couldn't determine when the smoke appeared.

The smoke swirled faster and faster, absorbing the surrounding air, and the black light inside grew stronger.

"Whoosh..."

With a gust of wind, the smoke finally condensed, and the vortex stopped.

A man with a slightly hunched back emerged from the dense black light.

Han Li's gaze condensed, carefully examining the man, and saw that his skin was as black as ink, his eyes were peculiar, with a purple glow in his left eye, and a green glow in his right eye, but it was hazy, like a veil.

The man's facial features were sharp, with high cheekbones, a sharp nose, and thin lips, making him look like a handsome middle-aged man, but his gray hair was disheveled, and his beard was thick and unkempt, making him look like an old man.

After appearing, the man immediately shrunk, hugging his knees, and sat down, muttering to himself, unclear and unrecognizable.

Just as everyone was confused, the man's back suddenly lit up with a black light, and a black vortex appeared.

Han Li and the others saw this, and their faces changed, their eyes widening in shock.

A black crystal thread emerged from their foreheads, twisting and flying towards the man's vortex.

Han Li's crystal thread flew out, and he tried to capture it, but it passed through his palm without feeling.

At the same time, the cultivators waiting outside the tower, saw their own crystal threads flying out, and they were shocked.

The threads flew towards the tower, and disappeared into the vortex.

The cultivators followed the threads, and saw them disappear, their faces filled with confusion.

But soon, many people began to leave the camp, dispersing in all directions.

In the tower, the remaining cultivators and monsters also had their crystal threads fly out, disappearing into the void.

All the threads, no matter where they came from, had the same destination, the black vortex on the man's back.

Han Li watched the threads flying into the man's body, and felt a strange sensation.

When the threads left his body, he felt a sudden lightness, as if something had been taken away.

But strangely, Han Li didn't know when the thread appeared in his spiritual sea.

His cultivation technique couldn't detect it.

In fact, everyone present had the same feeling, a sense of unease.

Before the threads left, they hadn't noticed anything, but after they left, they all felt a change in their mental state.
Just a moment ago, everyone was still trying to figure out what was going on.

The crowd was still in shock when the middle-aged man's black vortex disappeared, and he stood up from the ground, yawning and stretching his waist.

His aura had surged to an unimaginable level, and his cultivation had reached the peak of the Great Luo Realm. Every move he made seemed to affect the void, causing ripples to spread out.

However, after he stopped yawning and retracted his arm, his aura gradually subsided, and there was no longer any unusual phenomenon around him. He looked like a ordinary, tattered madman.

But when he turned to face the crowd, Daoyin True Person's expression changed, and he exclaimed in shock:

"It's the Great Black Heaven Old Demon!"

Lei Yuce and the others heard this and their faces turned pale.

"Who are you..." 

The middle-aged man, who was called the Great Black Heaven Old Demon by Daoyin True Person, scratched his head and said, but before he could finish, a golden fire pillar descended from the sky and struck him, sending him tumbling to the ground.

The fire pillar was surrounded by a thousand-fold gravity, causing the ground to crack and shatter. The sound of "crackling" echoed through the air.

Han Li looked over and saw that the Years of Life Lamp was wrapped in a crimson blood thread, and Daoyin True Person had used his own blood to activate the lamp, causing it to burst with energy and send the Great Black Heaven Old Demon tumbling into the ground.

The sound of "rumbling" continued for a while before gradually subsiding.

The attention of everyone in the hall was focused on the large pit in the ground, where a hot wave was rising, and the Great Black Heaven Old Demon's aura was suddenly no longer detectable.

Just as everyone was puzzled, a sighing sound came from the pit.

A figure emerged from the pit, its body moving in an extremely strange posture, and it floated in mid-air before suddenly appearing in front of Daoyin True Person.

Daoyin True Person was already on high alert, and he quickly threw out a spell.

A loud "whooshing" sound was heard!

The Years of Life Lamp shook violently, and the golden lotus petals on the lamp emitted a brilliant light. A wave of golden flames shot out, gathering in mid-air to form a rain of fire flowers that flew towards the Great Black Heaven Old Demon.

The demon did not dodge or avoid the flames, but instead charged forward, his fists glowing with a dense, black light. He swung his fists, and countless black fist shadows flew out.

The sound of "rumbling" echoed through the air as the fist shadows and flames collided. The originally intense flames were easily scattered by the demon.

However, after the flames dispersed, a new wave of colorful light emerged, and the Five Elements Void Array was activated once again, enveloping the Great Black Heaven Old Demon.

"Get out of the way..."

The Great Black Heaven Old Demon's voice was hoarse, and his tone was filled with impatience. He charged into the colorful light, his body shattering into a cloud of black smoke.

But before Daoyin True Person could relax, the black smoke had already condensed into a hand, which slapped Daoyin True Person's chest.

A loud "boom" was heard.

The remaining black smoke surged forward, and Daoyin True Person let out a pained cry as he was sent flying backward.

The black smoke continued to condense, and the Great Black Heaven Old Demon's body reappeared.

Daoyin True Person was already heavily injured, and this latest attack had left him on the brink of collapse. He spat out a few mouthfuls of blood and fell to the ground, unconscious.

Han Li and the others were shocked by this scene.

This Great Black Heaven Old Demon was not only unafraid of the Years of Life Lamp's flames but also seemed to be immune to the Five Elements Void Array's attacks.

Qimozu furrowed his brow, thinking to himself that he was no match for this demon.

After injuring Daoyin True Person, the Great Black Heaven Old Demon did not immediately pursue him. Instead, he looked at the Years of Life Lamp, which had suppressed him for so many years, and scratched his head, seemingly lost in thought.

Lei Yuce saw this and wanted to rescue Daoyin True Person, but he was afraid of provoking the Great Black Heaven Old Demon. He was covered in cold sweat, but he did not dare to make a move, fearing that he would enrage the demon.
