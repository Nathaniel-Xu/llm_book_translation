Han Li faced the incoming Judge's long tongue, and the time law within his body rotated, causing his body to flash rapidly, narrowly avoiding the attack.

In the brief moment, he noticed that the red lightning symbols on the Judge's tongue had disappeared.

"Roar..."

Just then, a loud bellowing sound came from the Wailing Soul's mouth, and its back arched violently, the sharp spikes on its back flashing with intense white light, constantly striking the descending blood-colored light wall, shattering it into fragments.

However, amidst the shattered blood-colored crystal light, a large amount of golden light suddenly appeared, followed by a loud thunderous sound.

"Boom boom boom"

Dozens of Qingtian Cloud Swords, wrapped in golden lightning, suddenly fell from the blood light, interconnected, forming a golden lightning condensed array, which descended and repressed the Wailing Soul, which had just escaped.

The golden lightning was like boiling water, overflowing and rolling on the Wailing Soul's back, shaking the heavens.

The divine lightning on the Qingtian Cloud Swords had a natural suppressing effect on yin-evil objects, and the Wailing Soul was no exception. After the golden lightning rolled over, the Wailing Soul's back was a mess of blood and flesh.

Han Li saw this scene and his eyes widened in anger. He clenched his fist and summoned his flying sword.

The Qingtian Cloud Swords trembled violently, struggling to fly back to Han Li's side, but they were unable to move due to the blood light surrounding them.

Just as the flying swords were about to be crushed by the Judge's giant foot, Han Li let out a loud roar, and his tongue pierced the air, shooting a blast of energy at the Qingtian Cloud Swords.

"Whoosh whoosh" A loud, piercing sound echoed through the air.

The dozens of Qingtian Cloud Swords, which had been controlled by the Judge, suddenly trembled and broke free from their control, flying back to Han Li.

Without the divine lightning's suppression, the Wailing Soul's back relaxed, and its body shrunk back into its human form, dodging the Judge's giant foot and returning to Han Li's side.

"This guy's ghostly arts are indeed different from others... His yin-evil aura seems to have cultivated a kind of returning-to-true-nature, centralizing energy... It's possible that he's turning from yin to yang, from evil to good... My suppressing ability is not as strong as before." The Wailing Soul panted heavily for a moment, not forgetting to report this to Han Li.

"Are you okay? I didn't let you out earlier because I was worried about this. It seems that this guy's ability to rank among the four great sacred envoys is not without reason." Han Li's brow furrowed in concern.

"This Judge is still not the main enemy, we've been fighting for half a day and still haven't met the real master. It's a bit embarrassing." The Wailing Soul shook its head, indicating that it was unharmed.

"Who says we haven't?" Han Li raised an eyebrow, countering.

The Wailing Soul looked at Han Li with a puzzled expression.

"Do you mean that the Judge is the real master?" Lan Yan asked, seeming to understand.

Before Han Li could respond, the Judge in the sky let out a loud roar, and its foot came crashing down again, accompanied by its long tongue, which drew a circular arc in the air, blocking their retreat.

"Lan Yan, block that long tongue for a moment." Han Li shouted.

Lan Yan nodded, and a blue, water-patterned bag appeared in his hand.

Han Li recognized it as the same bag that Lan Yan and his sister had obtained in the Years Tower.

Lan Yan lightly hummed, and the bag's water-patterned design began to glow intensely, emitting a sound like rushing water.

Suddenly, the bag's mouth opened, and eight blue water dragons, each dozens of feet long, burst out, charging towards the Judge's long tongue.

As they approached, a loud "boom boom boom" sound echoed through the air.

The water dragons' bodies glowed with lightning, and countless blue water lightning bolts shot out, constantly striking the Judge's long tongue, causing it to shudder and recoil.

Han Li saw this scene and his eyes flashed with understanding. He remembered that during the formation of the Five Elements Array, the five artifacts, including the white fire bead, the golden sword, and the blue bag, had all been recalled by the array.

After the array's collapse, the Firebird had taken back the white fire bead, and Lan Yan had apparently also retrieved the blue bag.

Compared to before, Lan Yan's cultivation had clearly increased, and his control over the artifact had become more refined.

Although he still couldn't unleash its full power, blocking the Judge's attack was sufficient.

The Judge's long tongue was battered by the water dragons' lightning, and it began to recoil, attempting to retreat back into the Judge's mouth.

Lan Yan wouldn't let up, holding the blue bag with one hand and raising the other.

The eight water dragons wrapped around the Judge's tongue, climbing up together, and charged towards the Judge.

On the other side, the Judge's giant foot was about to crush them, bearing down with a force that seemed to weigh a thousand jun.
Han Li's mouth burst forth with a furious roar, his body's Heavenly Executioner's prison-sealing technique went into a frenzy, his true spirit's blood veins simultaneously activated, and his body suddenly expanded to a hundred feet, transforming into a three-headed, six-armed demonic form.

With a mighty stomp of his foot, his body didn't dodge or evade, instead charging towards the giant boot, his two massive ape-like arms wrapped in layers of white energy, striking towards the boot with a loud crash.

A deafening boom resounded!

A circle of violent energy burst forth from the sky, Han Li's body plummeting downwards, crashing into the ground.

Meanwhile, in the air, the giant boot that had stomped down was repelled by a single punch, sending the giant Judge's body stumbling backwards, toppling over.

At the same time, the eight water dragons controlled by Lan Yan simultaneously launched a fierce attack, their long tongues shooting towards the Judge's head.

"Zzt!"

A violent electric current crackled to life, the eight water dragons simultaneously exploding, sending the Judge's crown flying off.

Before the Judge could regain his footing, a layer of golden light enveloped him, transforming into a ball of starlight that rapidly expanded in all directions.

"Whoa!"

A mountain range descended from the sky, crashing down towards the Judge's head, a golden river flowing through it suddenly twisted and turned, like a golden belt, wrapping itself around his body in an instant.

The Judge, who had been so majestic and powerful just moments before, was now completely frozen in place, his body surrounded by a halo of golden light, his movements becoming sluggish.

"Get back, don't come any closer!" Han Li bellowed.

Lan Yan and Qi Hu heard his words and didn't hesitate, rapidly retreating backwards.

Han Li's body was surrounded by a halo of golden light, his hands forming a sword seal, and with a sudden movement, he unleashed a powerful strike.

Thirty-six bamboo swords shot out from his body, forming a phalanx-like formation, their sword tips pointing towards the sky, emitting a gentle hum, as if breathing.

As the swords reached their destinations, a strange spiritual energy fluctuation emanated from them, as if the surrounding air and the swords had become connected, forming a small, self-contained world.

As the sword array solidified, the air around it began to change, a thin layer of white mist rising, with occasional flashes of golden lightning, resembling a cloud of golden thunder.

"This is... the Heaven-Piercing Sword Array!" Lan Yan's eyes widened in shock.

Years ago, when she and her brother had mistakenly entered the Tower of the Years, she had seen the Heaven-Piercing Sword Array set up within the tower, although the one Han Li had set up was slightly different, the atmosphere it exuded was identical.

In fact, the sword array Han Li had set up seemed to possess an even more oppressive and majestic energy, making her feel a sense of suffocation, and she involuntarily retreated further away, feeling a bit more at ease.

At this moment, the Judge, who had been momentarily disrupted, finally regained his footing, his expression still wooden, but a hint of anger visible in his eyes.

His body glowed with a fierce red light, mingling with the golden light that bound him, and with a wave of his hand, the giant red pen he held began to move through the air.

However, due to the influence of the time law, his movements seemed slightly sluggish, and as the pen moved, ancient, crimson characters began to appear in the air, forming a mysterious, archaic text.

With each character's appearance, the air would shudder violently, as if thunder was booming, and the blood-red space around him would echo with a chilling, mournful cry.

It was as if the Judge's writing was summoning a storm, and the text was a harbinger of doom!

As the Judge continued to write, the text grew longer, and the pressure it exerted grew stronger, the cries of the ghosts and the thunderous booms becoming almost deafening, leaving Lan Yan's heart racing and her face pale.

Qi Hu, although not as affected, still felt a sense of unease, and she could sense a powerful, soul-shaking energy emanating from the text.

Just as the text was about to be completed, the sword array Han Li had set up began to change.

A loud, crackling sound filled the air!

The thirty-six bamboo swords surrounding Han Li began to shine with golden light, their surfaces erupting with electricity, transforming into thirty-six sturdy, golden lightning pillars that shot towards the sky.

A series of powerful, lightning-wreathed sword auras burst forth from the swords, filling the air with a deafening, thunderous roar, as if the very fabric of space was being torn apart.

The next moment, the air around the Judge began to distort, and the golden lightning pillars, accompanied by the powerful lightning, surged forth, layer upon layer, striking towards him with incredible force.

(To all my fellow cultivators, I'm afraid I can only post one chapter today, as I'm currently attending a meeting outside...)
