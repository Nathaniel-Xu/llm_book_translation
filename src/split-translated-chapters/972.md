Han Li's gaze flickered as he looked around, his expression contemplative.

Although he had found the Naike Great Formation's formation diagram in the rear hall, he still didn't know why this formation was here, or where the blood-colored light gate's vital energy came from.

Looking at E Mo, he was probably somewhat aware of something.

Han Li raised his head to look at the sky, his thoughts racing nonstop.

E Mo and Sha Xin had left without hesitation, it seemed that the sacred remains were definitely not here, and were probably hidden in a deeper part of the vast wilderness.

However, in order to pursue Zi Ling, and also to be able to leave this Accumulated Scales Realm, no matter the danger, he couldn't retreat.

Han Li exhaled a long breath, as if he had spouted out all his worries, and his expression returned to calm.

His hands were empty, and a brilliant white light surged on his body, with densely packed, fine spots of mysterious energies appearing all over him, a total of four hundred and seventy-five.

Just now, although Zhuan Ge had interfered, he still managed to complete the first three tiers of the Heavenly Massacre Imperial Prison Technique with the help of the Naike Great Formation's power before the formation collapsed.

Moreover, his body's Polarity Seal Bottle had absorbed nearly half of the Naike Great Formation's power, which could be drawn out later to break through other meridians.

With his current physical strength, although he couldn't be a match for E Mo and Sha Xin, apart from those two, no one among the Xuan Castle and Kuicheng's people could be his match.

Also, with his current speed, even if he encountered E Mo and Sha Xin, he should still have a bit of hope to escape.

Han Li quickly retracted the white light on his body and jumped back down to the ground.

His gaze shifted, looking towards the other side of the blood pool.

Chenyang and Xuan Yuan were still standing there, unmoving.

He pressed a seal and pointed, and their heads flashed with a crystal light, several crystal chains shot out.

Chenyang's bodies moved, and they immediately recovered.

They looked around and saw that the grand hall was in an even more disastrous state than before, and apart from Han Li, there was no one else around. Their expressions changed.

"Are you alright, Dao friend...?" Chenyang looked at Han Li, a hint of awkwardness flashing on his face, and spoke in a stutter.

"The Kuicheng people have all left, you two can chase after them if you want," Han Li said indifferently, and didn't bother with them.

His body flickered, turning into a wisp of cyan smoke, which shot out of the large hole in the wall.

Once outside, Han Li swept his gaze around, and his eyebrows furrowed.

In this Vast Wilderness' secret realm, his spiritual sense had little effect, so he could only carefully investigate the remaining fluctuations in the sky and earth to determine where Sha Xin's group had gone.

However, the time interval was too long, and the remaining marks in the void were extremely sparse, so he could only roughly determine a direction, and his body leaped forward, chasing after that direction.

At this moment, his body seemed to be filled with an inexhaustible amount of power, and he was still somewhat unaccustomed to the immense strength in his hands and feet, which often involuntarily burst out with a humming sound.

In a few flashes, his shadow had already disappeared into the distance.

Along the way, he still saw vast expanses of ruined buildings, crumbling walls, and scars everywhere.

Han Li's thoughts were on the black-robed woman called "Little Zi", and he didn't have the time to investigate these places, so he relentlessly pursued her.

Three days later.

Han Li arrived at a desolate garden, where winding corridors encircled, and were dotted with giant, varied boulders, covering a vast area.

As he followed the garden corridor, he suddenly heard the sound of clashing blades coming from the left front, mixed in with some familiar, shrill cries.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he suppressed the fluctuations of his stellar powers, not jumping up, but carefully approaching.

Exiting the garden, he proceeded forward for a few dozen miles, and after passing through a dense area of ruins, he arrived at the edge of an enormous, several-tens-of-thousands-of-meters-wide, deep crater.

He hid behind a crumbling green rock wall, looking down.

Only to see that the deep crater was filled with thunderous noises.

A bone-armored, white-robed woman, holding a white bone whip and a white bone spear, was moving up and down in the crater, her wrist twisting and turning as the whip danced wildly, striking a black-armored man wielding a battle knife.

Where the whip landed, brilliant white lights flashed, accompanied by the sound of thunder exploding, causing the void to shake.

"Is that her?" Han Li muttered.

The white-robed woman was none other than Kotensen, who was fighting a black-armored man.

On his body, he wore a suit of purple magic armor, its purple light radiating strongly, using the armor to withstand Kotensen's long whip, and resisting its attacks with his battle knife in hand, pressing in on Kotensen.

Kotensen had three blood holes on her abdomen, and her lower garments were stained with blood, resembling plum blossoms blooming in the snow. It was clear that she had already clearly fallen into a disadvantageous position, and it was only a matter of time before she was defeated.
Han Li's gaze shifted, and he noticed a woman's corpse lying not far from the two of them. Her figure was petite and slender, with a bullet wound in her chest. It was the gentlewoman who had been following Shi Zhanfeng earlier.

A clanging sound!

Gu Qianxun's whip wrapped itself around Shi Zhanfeng's long knife, its tip striking towards his face like a snake spitting venom.

Shi Zhanfeng retreated a step, his long knife violently jerking upwards, causing the whip to tense up.

"Break for me!" he roared, his mouth filled with fury. The starlight on his long knife flashed brightly, and a powerful, overwhelming force erupted.

A series of explosive sounds rang out, and the white whip shattered inch by inch, exploding in all directions.

Gu Qianxun was impacted by the unleashed energy, her abdominal wound worsening, and she stumbled backward.

Shi Zhanfeng had already rushed forward, his knife swooping down towards her with great force.

Gu Qianxun's face turned pale, her hand holding onto her bone spear as she blocked the attack. The force was immense, and the black stone floor cracked, Gu Qianxun's legs sinking into it below the knees. She coughed up more blood, her face deathly pale, and her body trembled.

Shi Zhanfeng knocked the bone spear out of her hand, his knife pressed against her neck, his expression ruthless. "Who instructed you to launch a sneak attack on me?"

Gu Qianxun's gaze was somewhat dazed, and she glanced at the corpse in the distance, feeling a pang of regret.

If it weren't for this woman, who had sacrificed herself to block that one attack, Gu Qianxun would have had the opportunity to kill Shi Zhanfeng.

"Why ask questions? Kill me if you want to," Gu Qianxun said slowly, her voice weak.

"There's no need to waste time with you here; I still have to return to the Qianji Temple. Since you're eager to die, I'll grant you that wish." Shi Zhanfeng sneered, raising his knife to strike.

Just then, a piercing sound cut through the air.

A fireball shot towards Shi Zhanfeng's knife, the force behind it unimaginable. It struck the knife with a loud clang, sending Shi Zhanfeng stumbling backward.

Shi Zhanfeng glanced at the knife mark on his blade and discovered that it was a piece of melted stone, slowly flowing down the length of the knife.

He turned to look at Han Li, who was standing in the distance, three or four stones the size of walnuts in his hand, catching and tossing them in a slow and deliberate motion as he walked towards them.

"Is that...?" Shi Zhanfeng's expression changed, and he exclaimed in surprise.

"Li Dao...friend..." Gu Qianxun's expression was complex, and she muttered under her breath.

"Great Temple Master, you're unharmed, I presume?" Han Li said, a hint of a smile on his lips.

Shi Zhanfeng watched Han Li approach, his eyes narrowing slightly as a strange feeling arose within him. The person before him seemed different from the Han Li he knew.

"Are you here to intervene in my private feud with her?" Shi Zhanfeng asked, his brow furrowed.

"I don't know if you have a private feud with her, but I have some matters to discuss with her. If you'll excuse us, Great Temple Master," Han Li replied, his footsteps uninterrupted.

"Let's resolve our business first, and then you can talk to her," Shi Zhanfeng sneered, his wrist twisting as he swung his knife towards Gu Qianxun's head once more.

Han Li's eyes flashed, and his palm glowed with a brilliant white light. He rubbed his fingers together, and the ordinary stone in his hand turned red-hot.

He jerked his wrist, and a soft crackling sound filled the air, followed by a long, piercing whine.

Four red-hot stones shot out from his hand, becoming four intertwining arcs of fire that flew towards Shi Zhanfeng. Two of the stones struck his war knife, while the other two targeted his dantian and heart.

Shi Zhanfeng's face paled, and he swiftly raised his knife to defend himself.

The two stones aimed at his knife missed their mark, but the other two struck it with a deafening crash, sending Shi Zhanfeng flying backward, his legs scraping against the ground and creating deep grooves.

Once he regained his balance, Shi Zhanfeng glanced at the two visible cracks on his knife and scowled.

"It seems Li Dao has had another breakthrough in this great market. I suppose I'll give you face this time."

Shi Zhanfeng's voice had barely faded when his white bone knife snapped in two with a loud crack.

He tossed the hilt aside, his expression calm, and smiled faintly. "Until next time, farewell."

With that, he turned and leaped into the distance, disappearing from sight.

Han Li let him go without interference, turning to approach Gu Qianxun.

Gu Qianxun's eyes had been fixed on him, and she forced a weak smile.
