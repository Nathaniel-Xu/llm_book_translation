Qi Mozi saw this scene, but he didn't panic, instead, he revealed a hint of cold smile.

A brilliant golden light burst forth from his body, enveloping the surrounding area, forming a golden spiritual domain that covered him and Xiong Shan.

This spiritual domain was incredibly dense, and from the outside, it was impossible to see what was happening inside. Only faint glows of treasures could be seen, as if Qi Mozi had taken out a protective treasure.

Lan Shi's siblings were skilled in the Water Law, and they were confident in their defensive abilities. They wouldn't have chosen to act alone if they weren't confident in withstanding the Five Elements Array.

But when they felt the power of the five-colored light balls, their faces changed, and they quickly opened their spiritual domains, intertwining them with each other.

A series of blue law crystals shot out from their bodies, entwining with each other, and merging into a blue vortex.

Next to the vortex, two domain spirits appeared, both with human upper bodies and snake lower bodies. They held two trident-like water spears, surrounded by blue light.

The two domain spirits rapidly moved around Lan Shi, their water spears dancing, releasing countless blue water bombs that swirled around them.

On the other side, Han Li and the others had already set up their defensive formations.

Hu San was the first to act, opening his spiritual domain and taking out the Heaven Fox Blood Knife.

He spat out a mouthful of pure blood, which merged with the knife, causing it to emit a dazzling blood glow. The knife's size increased by a hundred times, transforming into a massive blood-colored blade.

Hu San quickly formed a blood-colored knife array, covering the three of them.

At the same time, Jiao San's body glowed with a dark red light, and she opened her spiritual domain.

Four dark red crystal lights shot out from her body, landing on the four sides of the spiritual domain, forming four dark red pagodas.

The pagodas were inscribed with the characters for east, south, west, and north, emitting a massive amount of dark red light that intertwined with each other, forming a dark red light shield that protected the three of them.

At this moment, a massive golden light burst forth from Han Li's body, forming a time spiritual domain that enveloped the three of them.

A green light flashed, and the Xuan Tian Gourd appeared above Han Li's head.

The gourd emitted a gentle tremor, and 36 green bamboo swords shot out, surrounding the three of them and forming a defensive sword array.

Just as everyone had set up their defenses, countless five-colored light balls descended upon them.

The light balls, which had been relatively stable, exploded as soon as they touched the defensive formations, releasing a massive amount of energy.

The entire hall was filled with a blinding five-colored light, covering everyone's spiritual domains, divine abilities, and treasures.

The golden light shield surrounding the hall remained unmoving, as if it was a powerful seal.

Han Li and the others were also engulfed in the five-colored light, their defenses struggling to withstand the attack.

Hu San's blood-colored knife array was the first to be broken, shattering like paper.

The Heaven Fox Blood Knife reappeared, its blood glow dispersing, and it returned to its original size, emitting a mournful cry as it flew back into Hu San's arms.

Hu San's spiritual domain was also broken, and he stumbled backward, spitting out a mouthful of blood.

The five-colored light balls continued to surge forward, attacking Jiao San's dark red spiritual domain.

Jiao San saw Hu San's defenses being easily torn apart, and her eyes widened in shock. She let out a loud cry, and her dark red spiritual domain flashed brightly.

A series of dark red law crystals appeared, splitting into six, and forming six massive black holes that rapidly rotated.

The black holes seemed to connect to the depths of the underworld, and they emitted a massive devouring force that consumed many of the five-colored light balls.

The six black holes rotated, and the five-colored light balls were absorbed, their power neutralized.

However, the sheer number of five-colored light balls was too much, and the six black holes were unable to keep up. The spiritual domain shattered, and the black holes disappeared.

The five-colored light balls continued to attack, hitting the four dark red pagodas that formed the dark red light shield.

The pagodas glowed brightly, emitting a massive amount of law energy that rivaled Han Li's green bamboo swords.

The dark red light shield flashed rapidly, but it managed to withstand the attack.

However, the five-colored light balls' attack was too strong, and the dark red light shield only lasted for a few breaths before it shattered.

Jiao San's face turned pale, and she spat out a mouthful of blood, her aura weakening.

The five-colored light balls continued to attack, engulfing the four pagodas and the treasures within.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and he formed a hand seal, releasing over 200 time law crystals that flew out of his body, swirling within the time spiritual domain.

The time spiritual domain, which had already been close to solidifying, became even more condensed.
At the same time, a golden light flashed behind Han Li, and the True Speech Treasure Wheel emerged, spinning rapidly as it released countless golden ripples that merged with the Time Spirit Domain.

Boom!

The surging five-colored essence beams crashed into the Time Spirit Domain, immediately being enveloped by the power of the Time Laws, and instantly becoming motionless.

However, the energy of the five-colored essence beams was too great, causing the Time Spirit Domain and the True Speech Treasure Wheel to tremble violently. The subsequent waves of five-colored essence beams continued to crash into the Time Spirit Domain, causing its tremors to intensify, and it seemed on the verge of shattering.

Han Li had encountered this situation before in the Tongtian Sword Array, but the power of the Wuhang Void Array was far greater, and it had almost broken through his True Speech Treasure Wheel in an instant.

Han Li, though shocked, remained calm and pinched his fingers together once more.

His body was surrounded by a burst of golden light as the Disconnected Time Flame, the Eastern Yi Divine Tree, the Light Shadow Purification Bottle, and the Fantasy Hourglass, four law objects, simultaneously emerged and radiated dazzling golden light, merging with the Time Spirit Domain.

The Time Spirit Domain, which was on the verge of collapse, suddenly stabilized, completely sealing off all the five-colored essence beams that had entered.

Han Li pinched his fingers again, and the thirty-six Qingtong Bee Cloud Swords that formed the sword array around him began to rotate.

Instantly, countless sharp sword energies spun and sliced through the domain, shredding more than half of the five-colored essence beams.

At the same time, the emerald green aura surrounding the Xuantian Gourd above his head suddenly brightened, and a emerald green aura shot out from the gourd's mouth, sweeping towards the remaining five-colored essence beams in the domain.

These five-colored essence beams, which had been sealed off by Han Li's Time Divine Ability, were immediately enveloped by the emerald green aura and sucked into the Xuantian Gourd.

In an instant, the Time Spirit Domain was cleared of all five-colored essence beams.

The subsequent five-colored essence beams that continued to crash in were also sealed off and devoured.

The five-colored essence beams in the hall surged violently for a moment before finally dispersing.

The people in the hall reappeared, each with a different situation.

The Blue Clan siblings, Blue Yan and Blue Yuan, were near the entrance of the hall. Blue Yan's body was covered in blood, and her left hand, left foot, and half of her body were missing. She sat on the ground, staring blankly at a blue jade flower in her right hand.

Blue Yan's shoulders trembled slightly, and tears streamed down her face.

Blue Yuan was nowhere to be seen, leaving behind only two broken immortal artifacts.

The four-domain demon array formed by the Eagle Nose Demon and the others had also collapsed, and two of the demons, the Copper Lion Demon and the Blood Hand Demon, were nowhere to be seen, leaving behind only a few broken demon artifacts.

The Eagle Nose Demon, the White Bone Demon, and the Turtle Shell Demon were all severely injured, their faces filled with fear.

Next to them, a bright golden light flashed, and two figures appeared: Qi Mozi and Xiong Shan.

The two of them were unharmed, their clothes intact.

Inside the five-colored light screen, Dao Yin's face turned even paler, and Lei Yu's group was also affected, their auras greatly diminished.

Han Li withdrew his gaze from the surrounding crowd, pinched his fingers together, and put away the True Speech Treasure Wheel and the other objects.

Jiao San and Huo San stumbled, but managed to catch their breath.

Dao Yin, seeing that there were still many people alive in the hall, seemed surprised, and his eyes flashed with killing intent once more. He pinched his fingers together, pointing at the five-colored disk in front of him.

"Han Daoist, Liu Daoist, if we continue to passively take hits, we'll all die here. I have a plan to turn the situation around, but I need your help."

Jiao San saw Dao Yin's actions and immediately exchanged a message with Han Li and Huo San.

"You're talking about releasing the demon head from the altar?" Han Li's eyes flashed, and he immediately guessed Jiao San's meaning.

"What? Release that demon head? That person might be a Dao Ancestor, and it's a demon from the demon tribe. What if it attacks us after breaking free?" Huo San exclaimed.

"The current situation doesn't allow us to think too much. Besides, I have at least 70% confidence that I can prevent it from attacking us," Jiao San said.

Han Li heard this and felt a sudden surge of excitement.

For some reason, he felt that releasing the demon head was the best option, and even when he arrived at this place, he had this impulse, but it was suppressed.

After all, if they continued to passively take hits, the situation would only get worse.

The Wuhang Void Array's attack had been barely manageable, but as one of the top ten ancient arrays, it must have other attack methods.

If everyone in the hall was killed, Han Li wouldn't be confident in facing the Wuhang Void Array and the Tongtian Sword Sect alone.

As for the consequences of releasing the demon head, he didn't want to think about it.
