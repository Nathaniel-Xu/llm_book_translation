The Jingyan Firebird's eyes, filled with a hint of pain, gazed at Han Li, but a thread of joy flickered within them.

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise at this sight.

At this moment, a strand of white flames emerged from the Jingyan Firebird's body, sweeping across it from head to toe in a flash.

The seven-colored flames on the Jingyan Firebird's body vanished instantly, and the power of the Qicai Fire Dan Sand was completely refined and merged into the Firebird's body.

Moreover, the fire energy within the Jingyan Firebird's body was also cleansed and refined, leaving only the essence behind.

The Jingyan Firebird's body smoothed out, and its silver flames rippled, as it suddenly shrunk by nearly half. However, the flames emanating from its body grew stronger by several times, and a hint of fire law fluctuations emerged from its body.

This fire law was not the same as the law of the white fire bead, but a higher level of fire law.

Han Li sensed the Jingyan Firebird's transformation and felt a stir in his heart.

The Jingyan Firebird had been consuming various flames for years, constantly increasing its strength, but it had yet to truly give birth to law energy. Unexpectedly, after obtaining the power of the white fire bead, it had refined its internal fire energy and finally begun to give birth to law energy, and it was an extremely high-level fire law.

The Jingyan Firebird let out a joyful cry, its wings unfolding as it shot out, its body transformed into a massive silver firebird, hundreds of feet in size, circling and dancing in the air.

The Jingyan Firebird's transformation was vastly different from its previous form, its body longer and more majestic, with a flame crown on its head and nine flame feathers on its back, exuding a sense of nobility.

A terrifying wave of heat emanated from the silver giant bird's body, several times stronger than before, and comparable to the flames released by the white fire bead. The surrounding air trembled violently, as if it was about to be ignited.

The Jingyan Firebird soared through the air, its cries growing louder, its eyes filled with excitement, as it suddenly flapped its wings.

Its wings burst forth with silver light, and a stream of silver flames shot out, covering the surrounding mountains and peaks, like a meteor shower.

The surrounding mountains were instantly pierced by the silver flames, and the giant mountain was also struck, creating a deep, bottomless hole.

A series of deafening explosions followed, as the silver flames erupted and spread, connecting with each other, forming a massive silver sea of flames, dozens of miles in size.

A wave of extreme heat emanated from the silver sea, causing everything within its range to melt rapidly, and the surrounding mountains were reduced to wisps of smoke, disappearing into nothingness.

The giant mountain was also affected, its surface melting, revealing a massive gap.

However, the giant mountain was too massive, and the gap was insignificant compared to its entirety. The mountain body didn't even budge.

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise, his eyes flashing with excitement, as he realized that the Jingyan Firebird's strength had surpassed his expectations.

But he immediately furrowed his brow, thinking that this commotion was too close to the Huoyuan Palace, and if it attracted the attention of the Qiemozi and others, it would be disastrous.

He immediately transmitted a mental message to the Jingyan Firebird, ordering it to stop.

However, the Jingyan Firebird seemed to have gotten carried away, ignoring Han Li's message, and instead, it turned its gaze towards the giant mountain, its eyes narrowing, as if unsatisfied with its previous attack.

It let out a high-pitched cry, its body bursting forth with silver flames, as it shot out the white fire bead, striking the giant mountain.

The white fire bead's body glowed brightly, rapidly expanding.

Originally only three inches in diameter, it instantly grew to three feet, then thirty feet, three hundred feet, and finally, three thousand feet in diameter!

The surface of the giant bead was surrounded by a scorching white flame, making it impossible to look directly at it, as if the sun had appeared in the sky.

The surrounding area, over a thousand miles in radius, turned a scorching white, and the temperature increased to a terrifying level, causing all the mist to evaporate, and the mountains to begin melting rapidly.

A wave of destructive energy emanated from the giant bead, causing the surrounding air to distort, and the space to tear apart, revealing countless spatial rifts.

Han Li was about to intervene, but the surrounding air rippled, and a wave of spatial rifts emerged, cutting towards his body.

He furrowed his brow, his mouth uttering a low growl, as the True Word Treasure Wheel appeared behind him, releasing a wave of golden ripples that spread across the surrounding area.

The spatial rifts within the hundred-foot radius were momentarily halted, but the power contained within them was too great, causing the golden ripples to tremble violently, as if struggling to contain the rifts.
Han Li hastily activated the True Speech Treasure Wheel, stabilizing the golden ripples that had appeared earlier. He looked at the Blazing Flame Bird and the White Giant Pearl in shock.

He had just activated the pearl, and it had only released a small flame. Compared to the White Giant Pearl before him, it was insignificant.

Not only that, but the Blazing Flame Bird and the Blue-Colored Bag had also been activated, releasing a powerful aura. However, compared to the White Giant Pearl, it was still far inferior.

The White Giant Pearl didn't stop, instead, it flew forward, accelerating rapidly, and crashed into the Heavenly Pillar Mountain.

A deafening sound echoed through the air!

The Heavenly Pillar Mountain, which had been unmoving, began to shake violently, emitting a low rumbling sound that lasted for a long time. Countless rocks of various sizes fell from the sky.

The White Giant Pearl directly embedded itself into the mountain wall, its surface spewing out flames that burned and melted the layers of the mountain wall. It seemed to be trying to penetrate the mountain.

However, at this moment, a brilliant golden light spread out, enveloping the White Giant Pearl.

A temporal law force swirled within the golden light, slowing down the White Giant Pearl's speed by ten times.

Han Li's figure flashed, and he appeared near the mountain wall. He waved his hand, and over 200 time law crystals flew out, merging with the golden light.

The golden light condensed into a massive golden hand, which entered the mountain wall and grasped the White Giant Pearl.

The White Giant Pearl's flames rolled and burned, scorching the golden hand, but it remained motionless.

"That's enough, stop causing trouble!" Han Li coldly gazed at the Blazing Flame Bird and ordered.

The Blazing Flame Bird's excitement quickly dissipated, replaced by a timid expression. Its massive body shrunk, transforming into the Blazing Flame Child.

The White Giant Pearl also shrunk rapidly, returning to its original size, and flew back to the Blazing Flame Child's side.

The silver flames surrounding the area also disappeared.

The Blazing Flame Child's silver flames had dimmed significantly, and the fire law that had just been born had been consumed by half. It was almost imperceptible.

However, the Blazing Flame Child didn't seem to mind, flying to Han Li's side and lowering its head in shame. It glanced at Han Li, then quickly looked away.

"Alright, don't be so reckless in the future," Han Li said with a smile, patting the Blazing Flame Child's head. He then put away the time law crystals.

The Blazing Flame Child let out a joyful cry, sitting on Han Li's shoulder, and absorbed the White Giant Pearl into its body.

As the pearl entered its body, the silver flames on its body surged, and a strand of fire-attribute energy from the void merged into the Blazing Flame Child's body.

Han Li sensed this and looked surprised.

The Blazing Flame Child had previously only been able to recover its energy by consuming existing flames, such as those from the earth. Now, with the White Giant Pearl's assistance, it could directly absorb fire-attribute energy from the void.

Han Li realized that the White Giant Pearl had more uses than just attacking.

However, even its attack power was already sufficient.

The White Giant Pearl's attack had been earth-shaking, and even Han Li wasn't confident he could withstand it. If the pearl hadn't collided with the Heavenly Pillar Mountain, dissipating most of its energy, he wouldn't have been able to capture it.

Moreover, based on the Blazing Flame Child's energy changes, it seemed that it could activate the White Giant Pearl to launch two more attacks like the previous one.

With the Blazing Flame Child as a trump card, Han Li's strength had increased significantly, and he had a higher chance of winning against Qimozi.

Han Li secretly let out a breath, suppressing his excitement, and transformed into a golden light, flying upwards. The Time Tower was no longer peaceful, and it was possible that released demons were roaming around. The Blazing Flame Child had caused a huge commotion, and it was no longer safe to stay.

As the Blazing Flame Child put away the White Giant Pearl, the void around them began to fog up again. Han Li's figure flashed, and he disappeared into the fog.

Just as Han Li had left, two figures flew in from below, arriving at the location where Han Li and the Blazing Flame Child had been. The two figures were Qimozi and Xiongshan.

Qimozi looked at the damaged mountain wall, then at the void, her brow furrowed, and her expression changed.

"It seems that a fierce battle took place here, and the opponents were not weak," Xiongshan said, looking around.

"There's still a residual temporal law energy here, and one of the people involved is likely Han Li. The other person is cultivating the fire law and used the Li Huo Tian Zhu to fight Han Li," Qimozi said after a moment of contemplation.
