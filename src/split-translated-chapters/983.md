Han Li struggled to stand up, staggering forward, raising his hand to pull out the Green Bamboo Bee Cloud Sword that had pierced into E Wu's dantian, his brows tightly furrowed as he swept the sword horizontally, cutting off half of E Wu's head.

At this moment, he also felt a sense of emptiness, and the True Word Treasure Wheel and the Green Bamboo Bee Cloud Sword both flashed with light and returned to his body on their own.

Han Li was covered in blood, his body in tatters, but he looked at the distant Purple Spirit with a smile on the corner of his mouth, his legs went soft, and he collapsed to the ground.

Madame Six Flowers, Bone Qiuxun, and Shi Chuankong all witnessed this scene with shocked expressions.

"E City Lord... E Wu... just like that... died?" Bone Qiuxun murmured to herself.

Madame Six Flowers did not speak, but silently nodded her head.

After the shock, Shi Chuankong couldn't help but let out a long breath and collapsed to the ground.

Han Li barely managed to sit cross-legged, took a deep breath, and closed his eyes.

At this moment, the golden elixir in his body quickly shrank and disappeared, and the immortal spiritual power in his body once again rapidly became stagnant.

He took the opportunity while the immortal spiritual power in his body could still circulate to hurriedly take out some healing elixirs from the Flowing Branch Space.

His healing elixirs had almost been exhausted, and how could the elixirs in Jilei Empty Realm compare to the elixirs outside?

After taking out enough elixirs, Han Li's eyes flashed, as if remembering something, and he reached into his arms.

A black light flashed in his hand, and he pulled out a black statue, which was the statue he had obtained from Zhaogu True Man that day.

Just as he finished doing all this, the golden elixir in Han Li's body completely disappeared, and the immortal spiritual power in his body once again became completely still.

He did not pay attention to this matter, took an elixir and swallowed it, and his injuries quickly healed.

"Fierce Dao friend, are you alright? I didn't expect you to have such strength, even E Wu is no match for you." Shi Chuankong came over and asked.

"It's okay." Han Li waved his hand indifferently, stood up and came to the side of Purple Spirit, carefully examining her condition.

Seeing that she was not seriously injured, he finally breathed a sigh of relief, then turned around and came to E Wu's corpse, his divine sense scanning over it, but his brows furrowed.

E Wu's body was empty, with nothing on it.

"How could this be?" Han Li was greatly surprised.

Storage magic treasures could not be used in Jilei Empty Realm, so everyone carried a lot of items on their bodies, such as elixirs and weapons, which were absolutely indispensable. How could E Wu's body be empty? Could it be that he lost them during the intense battle earlier?

His gaze turned and fell on a bone-white ring on E Wu's left hand.

The ring seemed to be made of some kind of bones, emitting a faint white light, and it did not look like an ordinary object.

Han Li pondered for a moment and took the ring off.

"Not bad eyesight. That is the Starry Sky Ring that I refined for E Wu using the bones of a Starry Sky Beast as the base, supplemented by starry sky restrictions and space restrictions, which can be used with the power of the stars." Madame Six Flowers' voice came over.

Upon hearing this, Han Li glanced at Madame Six Flowers, silently urging the star power in his body, pouring it into the bone ring, while also probing it with his divine sense.

The bone ring floated up with a layer of white light, resisting his divine sense.

Han Li's star power from the Mysterious Orifice crashed into the white light, and soon a soft "crack" sound was heard, the white light shattered, and his divine sense entered the bone ring.

The space inside the ring was not large, only about two or three meters in size, much smaller than any ordinary storage magic treasure outside, but since immortal spiritual power could not be used in Jilei Empty Realm, such a storage magic treasure was extremely precious.

Inside the storage space were piles of various items, elixirs, weapons, beast cores, and some books and classics.

Han Li's divine sense scanned over these items, quickly searching, and soon his eyes lit up, falling on a corner of the storage space, where there were two statues.

He was very familiar with these two statues, which were similar to the two Heavenly Tyrant Prison Skill statues in his hand, and it was clear that they were the remaining two.

Han Li was secretly pleased, but did not take them out to avoid attracting attention.

He withdrew his divine sense and put the storage bone ring on his own hand, then put the two statues and the elixirs on his body into it.

At this moment, a splash of blood shot out from the nearby blood lake, and a beam of blood light quickly wrapped around E Wu's body, pulling it into the lake and disappearing.

Han Li's eyebrows raised, he turned around and glanced at the crystal coffin, his face showing a hint of contemplation.

At this moment, Sha Xin on the side slowly regained consciousness.

Although her body was severely damaged, she still managed to stand up.

As Sha Xin regained consciousness, Purple Spirit, who was on the side, frowned and opened her eyes.

Seeing this, Han Li was overjoyed and was about to quickly walk over, but then his gaze shifted and he stopped in his tracks.
"Yao Kui!" Sha Xin looked around and quickly saw Yao Kui's corpse, revealing a shocked expression.

"City Lord Sha Xin, don't worry. Yao Kui has already been killed by Fellow Daoist Li." Madam Liuhua smiled and spoke.

Hearing this, Sha Xin's face relaxed. He looked at Han Li with a hint of astonishment in his eyes, about to say something.

"Alright, Yao Kui is dead, and there's nothing more for you here. Everyone else leave; Fellow Daoist Li, stay behind." A majestic voice came from the crystal coffin, still sounding like Crab Daoist.

At this moment, the blood lake water was still rushing towards the crystal coffin. The flesh and skin on the saint's corpse inside had already grown completely, turning into a naked male body.

He looked like a middle-aged man with a full head of white hair and a square face. Although his eyes were tightly closed, they still emitted an imposing aura.

"This appearance..." Han Li looked at the male body in the crystal coffin, his eyes flashing slightly.

At this moment, the man in the coffin bore some resemblance to the Crab Daoist from years ago, but not completely.

"Master, you have finally been resurrected, that's great!" Seeing this, Sha Xin revealed an ecstatic expression. Regardless of his injuries, he knelt before the crystal coffin and excitedly spoke.

"I have not yet fully recovered and need some time to recuperate. With Fellow Daoist Li guarding me, it will be enough." Crab Daoist continued.

"Ah, although Fellow Daoist Li helped us kill the villain Yao Kui, he is still an outsider. It's better for me to guard you, City Lord." Sha Xin glanced at Han Li and said softly.

"Fellow Daoist Li and I have known each other for many years, you don't need to worry. Moreover, I now have another important task to assign to you..." Crab Daoist's voice lowered halfway through, evidently switching to voice transmission.

Sha Xin's expression changed, then he nodded heavily and said to Han Li, "I'll leave this place to you, Fellow Daoist Li." He immediately led Ziling towards the exit.

"Wait, City Lord Sha Xin. Ziling is my friend. Please remove the restrictions in her soul and let her return to her true self." Han Li suddenly called out to Sha Xin.

Hearing this, Ziling's body trembled, revealing a complex expression.

"My memory, I almost forgot. When Ziling first entered Puppet City, I was worried she was a spy sent by Profound City, so I sealed her memory. Please don't blame me, Fellow Daoist Li. I will now release the seal." Sha Xin apologized to Han Li, then walked over to Ziling.

Her hands quickly formed a seal, then suddenly stretched out two fingers, pointing at Ziling's forehead while muttering.

Golden light emanated from her hands and entered Ziling's forehead.

Ziling's forehead immediately revealed golden patterns, forming a seal-like technique. Her eyes became dazed as she softly sat down on the ground.

"Release!" Sha Xin shouted softly.

The golden patterns on Ziling's forehead flashed, then turned into specks of light and scattered.

Ziling groaned and fell into a coma, her body falling towards the ground.

In a flash, Han Li appeared next to Ziling and caught her.

"What happened to her?"

"Fellow Daoist Li, don't worry. Daoist Ziling is only temporarily unconscious and will awaken soon." Sha Xin smiled faintly.

After saying this, she bowed again to the crystal coffin, turned, and walked outside.

Madam Liuhua and Gu Qianxun followed behind her.

Shi Chuankong's gaze moved away from Crab Daoist and looked at Han Li, seeming to want to say something, but in the end did not. He walked outside.

The group quickly left the underground space and arrived above ground.

Sha Xin closed the passage entrance and did not leave. Instead, she sat down cross-legged nearby, white light emanating from her body as if she was cultivating to heal her injuries.

Madam Liuhua and the others did not leave immediately either, each going to a side.

Madam Liuhua's expression fluctuated, then she gritted her teeth and led Gu Qianxun to Sha Xin. She bowed deeply and said, "I, Liu Hua, along with my daughter Qianxun, greet City Lord Sha Xin."

"Daoist Liu Hua, how can I accept such a grand gesture from a young woman?" Sha Xin slowly opened her eyes and calmly spoke.

"City Lord Sha Xin is virtuous and prestigious. Now with the help of the great person in the crystal coffin, unifying the Accumulated Scales Region is only a matter of time. I was previously muddle-headed, aiding the villain Yao Kui against you. I hope you can forgive me. I am now willing to turn over a new leaf and join your Puppet City. I hope the City Lord can accept me." Madam Liuhua earnestly stated.

"My daughter is also willing to join Puppet City. I hope the City Lord will accept us." Gu Qianxun also bowed and spoke.

"Oh, you want to join my Puppet City? Hehe, as for Gu Qianxun, we won't discuss that yet. Daoist Liu Hua, you previously helped Yao Kui create countless star weapons, causing immeasurable damage to our Puppet City. Even if I could be magnanimous and accept you, the others in Puppet City probably couldn't tolerate you." Sha Xin glanced at Madam Liuhua and coldly spoke.

"I understand. In order to quell the rage of the Puppet City Daoists, I am willing to reveal to City Lord Sha Xin the troop deployments around Profound City, as well as the weaknesses in the city's defenses. Most of Profound City's defenses were arranged by myself and Yao Kui. Is this acceptable?" Madam Liuhua bitterly smiled and asked.

"Since Daoist Liu Hua is so sincere, I am not an unreasonable person. Very well! From today onwards, you two are members of my Puppet City." Sha Xin's eyes lit up and she spoke.

"Thank you, City Lord." Madam Liuhua's eyes sparkled with joy. She and Gu Qianxun bowed again.
