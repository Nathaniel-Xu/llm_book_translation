As Han Li's eyes seemed to glaze over, the silver-horned giant rhino's body shifted slightly.

Han Li's gaze snapped back into focus, and he lifted his foot, lightly stomping it down. The silver-horned giant rhino was immediately pressed back down into the earth.

"I said I wouldn't kill you, but you should also preserve your own life," Han Li said calmly.

The silver-horned giant rhino's body trembled, not daring to move again.

"What kind of species is the young beast that possesses the bloodline of the ancient True Spirit King, and what kind of divine abilities does it possess?" Han Li asked.

"I don't know," the silver-horned giant rhino replied without hesitation.

"Indeed, it's more convenient to just search your soul," Han Li said, his brow furrowing in anger.

"I really don't know," the silver-horned giant rhino explained. "The young beast is in a state of deep sleep, sealed away like a stone statue, with no aura or energy emanating from it. I couldn't possibly discern its species."

Han Li snorted, "If that's the case, how do you know it possesses the True Spirit King's bloodline?"

"The ancient True Spirit King's bloodline is different from that of the other barbarian tribes," the silver-horned giant rhino said. "It has a natural suppressive effect on the barbarian tribes, like a wolf pack recognizing its king. You're not one of us, so you wouldn't know."

Han Li was actually aware of this, just like the Heavenly Phoenix's power within him naturally suppressed many large demon beasts.

"Take me to see the young beast," Han Li said.

Since it possessed the True Spirit King's bloodline, its bloodline power was naturally not weak. Han Li's current cultivation was still lacking two True Spirit bloodlines to complete his Twelve Transformations. If he could obtain a powerful bloodline from this young beast, his Heavenly Suppressing Demon Imprisonment Technique would become even more refined, and he would have more confidence when heading to the Great Golden Source Realm.

"You said earlier that you would let us go after questioning us, but now you're going back on your word," the silver-horned giant rhino said, its anger rising again. "It's true that humans are untrustworthy."

"Who told you that I'm human?" Han Li's thoughts stirred, and he asked.

"You're not human? That's impossible..." the silver-horned giant rhino shook its massive head, saying.

Han Li's gaze condensed, and his True Spirit bloodline began to circulate. A silver light flashed around him, and threads of silver lightning erupted, transforming into a massive silver lightning phoenix.

At the same time, he withdrew all the Qingzhong Bee Cloud Swords into his body, revealing his massive physique to the silver-horned rhino and cloud-patterned tiger tribe members.

Han Li knew that if he maintained his human identity, he would never be able to get the silver-horned giant rhino to take him to see the young beast. He didn't want to truly slaughter the two tribes, so he had to resort to this plan.

As the silver-horned giant rhino and the others sensed Han Li's True Spirit aura, they were all shocked.

"You, you... how is this possible?" the silver-horned giant rhino asked, its voice filled with incredulity.

"My True Spirit bloodline isn't fake, is it?" Han Li said, his voice like thunder. "I don't have any malicious intentions towards the young beast you mentioned. You said it's in a state of deep sleep, perhaps I can help."

As he spoke, he spread his wings, flying into the sky. The wind howled as he flapped his wings.

"I'll take you to see it," the silver-horned giant rhino said, its massive body rising from the ground. It looked up at Han Li in the sky, its eyes filled with a deep contemplation.

After rescuing the cloud-patterned tiger tribe's leader and having a conversation, Han Li learned that the silver-horned giant rhino's leader was named Sangtu, and the cloud-patterned tiger tribe's leader was called Yunbao.

A fierce battle to the death had been interrupted by Han Li's sudden appearance.

Later, the two tribes' members tended to their wounded, returning to their respective tribes. Only seven or eight people remained, following Sangtu and Han Li to the young beast's hiding place.

The group traversed the plain where they had previously clashed, arriving at a small mountain nearby. Under Sangtu's guidance, they found a hidden cave entrance.

As they approached the entrance, a wave of heat and a pungent smell of sulfur wafted out.

"Is it inside?" Han Li asked, his brow furrowed.

As he spoke, his divine sense expanded, scanning the interior of the cave. However, he didn't discover any unusual aura.

"It's inside the cave," Sangtu said. "Our tribe usually enters the cave to collect black rocks to forge war axes. We wouldn't normally venture deep into the cave, but some of our tribe members accidentally fell in and discovered it."

"Lead the way," Han Li said, his brow still furrowed.

Sangtu nodded, taking the lead as they descended into the cave.

At this moment, Sangtu's appearance hadn't changed much, but his body was no longer as massive and intimidating as before. He was only about ten feet tall, slightly more robust than a normal person.

In reality, not only the silver-horned giant rhino tribe but also the cloud-patterned tiger tribe had different body sizes during times of war and peace. Now, they were all standing upright, their heads no longer displaying the intense, wild patterns.

Han Li followed closely behind, with the others entering the cave in turn.

As they entered, Han Li discovered that the cave was surprisingly spacious, with signs of excavation on the walls and ceiling. The passageway sloped downward, stretching for over a thousand feet.
As they finally reached the end of the slope, they saw that the road ahead gradually narrowed, and a circular opening about seven or eight meters in diameter appeared.

Behind the opening, there was a vast empty area, where the firelight cast eerie shadows, and a pungent smell and scorching heat waves constantly emanated.

"This is where our people fell and discovered the young beast in the lava lake," Santu said.

"Let's go take a look," Han Li nodded and said.

Santu didn't hesitate, and his figure flashed as he flew into the cave.

Han Li followed closely behind, and as he entered the cave, he saw a massive underground lava lake.

The lava in the lake didn't flow, and on its surface floated huge black solidified plates, which seemed to be black rocks formed by the cooling of the lava. Between the plates, there were still visible red streaks, which were the liquid lava below.

Han Li's gaze swept across the lake's surface, and soon he saw a black, stone-like object floating in the center of the lake. It looked like a black dog curled up into a ball. His mind stirred, and he flew towards it.

As he approached, he focused his gaze on the "stone" and suddenly felt a strange sensation.

Santu and the others' gazes fell upon this, and they all couldn't help but slightly lower their heads, clearly due to the natural suppression of their bloodline. This black dog-like stone was the young beast Han Li had mentioned.

Han Li looked at them and then focused his gaze back on the stone, concentrating his divine sense to carefully examine it for a long time. The puzzled expression on his face grew more intense.

"Something's not right," Santu said, arriving beside Han Li. "Last time we came, the lava lake was still very active, and there weren't so many black rocks solidified. The lake's surface even had waves of fire."

"Was the young beast this black last time you saw it?" Han Li pointed to the stone and asked.

"Although it was black, I remember it clearly wasn't as dark as this," Santu said, looking at the stone.

Han Li's figure descended, and his hand lightly touched the "stone". He felt a slight chill on his fingertips.

"This beast was attacked by the power of the Ice Attribute Law, and its injuries are severe. To survive, it had to completely seal itself and hide in this lava lake, absorbing the lake's heat to resist its injuries," Han Li said.

"So that's why the lake's fire power has decreased so drastically, and we see this scene before us..." Santu said, suddenly understanding.

"Alright, since we've found it, let's take it back," Han Li said, his brow furrowed.

"Impossible," Yun Bao suddenly interrupted, standing in front of them.

Han Li's gaze rose, and he looked at Yun Bao.

Yun Bao's eyes flashed with fear, but he still said, "If it's healing its wounds here, and we rashly take it away, wouldn't we be putting it in danger?"

"Your concern is not unfounded, but you can rest assured, I have a way to save it," Han Li said, nodding.

He then spread his palm, and a silver flame appeared, emitting a scorching power that far surpassed the lava lake's, making Santu and the others feel uncomfortable and retreat.

"Can you feel at ease now?" Han Li asked.

"I was overthinking..." Yun Bao apologized, his hand across his chest.

"Let's go, take it back to the Silver Horned Rhinoceros Tribe," Han Li said.

Santu was overjoyed, while Yun Bao's eyes twitched with concern.

Han Li noticed but didn't say anything. The grudge between the two tribes, built up over a long time, couldn't be easily dispelled. He understood Yun Bao's concern.

About half an hour later, they left the lava cave and headed towards the depths of the plain.

...

The Silver Horned Rhinoceros Tribe was located on the left side of a large river, with tall, tent-like buildings made of rocks and animal hides scattered along the riverbank. From a distance, it looked magnificent.

When Han Li and the others returned, the entire tribe, regardless of age or sex, came out of their tents to welcome their leader, and when they sensed the bloodline's suppressive power from the "stone" being carried, they all involuntarily lowered their heads.

However, when they saw Yun Bao and the others, their eyes turned red with killing intent.

If not for Santu's intervention, the situation would have become chaotic.

But it was understandable, as almost everyone had relatives or friends who had died at the hands of Yun Bao's people.

Santu led the group to his own tent, where he had several tribesmen place the black "stone" on his animal hide bed.

Han Li raised his hand, and a small, silver flame human appeared in his palm.

As soon as it appeared, the temperature in the tent rose dramatically, and scorching heat waves emanated from it, forcing Santu and the others to retreat.
