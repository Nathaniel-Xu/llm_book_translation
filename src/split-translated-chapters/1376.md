As the mysterious and profound chanting voice of Guo or Jin echoed through the air, a layer of golden ripples began to spread out from his body, like the waves of a surging tide, constantly expanding in all directions.

Regardless of whether it was the void or physical objects, nothing could block the transmission of these golden ripples, which continued to spread from the Yaochi victory realm, transmitting to the Tian Gong continent, and from the Tian Gong continent to the Zhongtu Xian domain.

The four Heavenly Gates of the Zhongtu Xian domain were like a gigantic horn, constantly amplifying the waves of energy, continuing to transmit them throughout the entire True Immortal Realm.

In an instant, the three types of Xian domains, five hundred medium-sized Xian domains, and three thousand small Xian domains were all bathed in the golden ripples. Ordinary mortals and ordinary cultivators were completely unaware of this, and even True Immortals and Golden Immortals were only slightly sensitive to it. Only those who had reached the Taiyi Jade Immortal realm or above could sense the subtle changes in the surroundings.

But even if they discovered it, what could they do?

Guo or Jin's hands continued to point at the void in front of him, with golden light flashing at his fingertips. The giant chessboard-like formation also lit up with points of light, and a wave of unfathomable law energy began to emanate from it.

"Opening the heavens and splitting the earth, this is a rare opportunity, and all of you can witness this spectacle, which is a once-in-a-lifetime experience," Guo or Jin laughed loudly.

As soon as his words fell, the entire formation lit up with dazzling light, transforming into a massive pillar of light that shot up into the sky, directly shattering the heavenly curtain and breaking through the Qingming heavenly winds of the three realms, entering the void outside.

At the same time, in the East Victory continent's branch venue, chaos erupted, and Qing Qiu True Person sensed an unusual fluctuation at the center of the continent. He quickly turned around and looked, only to see that his mountain abode's three-story library was emitting a massive golden light, which was charging into the high sky.

The golden light originated from his unassuming three-story library, which was also the continent's Tian Tian Tower.

At this moment, the Tian Tian Tower was entirely enveloped in golden light, and its foundation, which was only a few dozen feet in diameter, was connected to a massive formation that was tens of thousands of miles in diameter. Various talismans floated and flew into the air.

At the same time, the Tian Tian Towers of the West He, South Zhan, and North Ju continents also simultaneously revealed the same phenomenon, each with a pillar of light connecting to the heavens.

The chaotic battles in various locations came to a sudden halt.

Everyone felt a sense of unease and panic as they sensed the power of the heavens and the earth merging.

"What is this?" Qing Qiu True Person couldn't help but whisper.

He had been stationed in the Tian Tian Tower for over three million years, and although he had always been indifferent to the tower's grandeur, he had never discovered the massive formation hidden beneath it.

Before he could finish his surprise, Qing Qiu True Person suddenly discovered that the law energy within his body had suddenly surged, transforming into strands of crystal lines that shot out from his body, flying towards the pillar of light.

He looked around in horror, only to discover that he was not the only one. Almost everyone around him had law energy condensing into lines, flowing out of their bodies, and flying towards the pillar of light.

As the pillar of light grew thicker and more intense, the various strands of crystal lines wove together into a massive, colorful web of light in the sky.

"No..." someone finally woke up, letting out a despairing cry.

"Escape, quickly escape..." someone else shouted in terror.

...

In an instant, regardless of whether they were from the Heavenly Court or the Wheel of Rebirth, everyone put aside their hatred and animosity, frantically rushing towards the East Heavenly Gate to escape.

Many people directly went to the transmission array in the East Heavenly Gate, attempting to use the transmission array to leave the Zhongtu Xian domain.

However, when they arrived, they discovered that the fluctuations emitted by the Tian Tian Tower's pillar of light had already disrupted the operation of almost all law energies on the continent, including the spatial laws.

The transmission array was now nothing more than a useless ornament.

Considering this, everyone rushed towards the East Heavenly Gate, hoping to escape as quickly as possible. The longer they stayed, the more severe their law energy would be drained, and they might not even have the chance to escape.

"Great Sovereign, what do you plan to do?" Qing Qiu True Person asked, looking towards the Xian domain.

He could sense some of the changes occurring there.

"Never mind, I won't bother you...," Qing Qiu True Person sighed, his body flashing as he exited the East Heavenly Gate, which was already crowded with people.

As he left the gate, he didn't even glance back, directly transforming into a white streak of light and shooting towards the distance.

However, just as he did, another anomaly occurred.

The majestic Heavenly Gate suddenly shook violently, and the various decorations on the gate pillars and the central pavilion began to peel off, revealing the talismans engraved beneath.

The talismans lit up with golden light, and a strange wave of energy emanated from them.

The cultivators who had been about to enter the gate were swallowed by a massive whirlpool that suddenly appeared, instantly turning them into dust.

The whirlpool then erupted with golden light, shooting out a massive pillar of light that extended into the void, like a dead-end road, abruptly suspended in mid-air.
Qingqiu True Person had just flown away for a short while when he suddenly felt a strong attractive force emanating from behind him. His heart tightened, and he quickly used his divine ability to try and escape.

However, the law threads that flowed out from his body were attracted to the light pillar, which forcibly pulled him back, causing him to fall into the vortex within the Yingtian Gate once again.

If even the mighty Dao Ancestor was unable to escape, how could the others?

This situation was unfolding simultaneously in all four directions of the Tianmen, turning the entire Middle Realm into a slaughterhouse for cultivators. Any cultivator with law force was unable to escape.

...

In the Tian Palace Continent, the sky above the Yaochi Paradise was like a burning flame, evaporating all the clouds, revealing a pitch-black domain outside.

Within that domain, a hundred-mile-wide chaotic vortex was slowly condensing and expanding.

Below the vortex, Guo or Jin's eyes gleamed with excitement, his entire being radiating an aura of satisfaction. The situation in the Middle Realm was unfolding exactly as he had predicted.

Compared to the other locations, the situation in Yaochi Paradise was even more dire. Every cultivator on the ground had law force threads converging on the vortex above, and the speed was increasing.

Half of the cultivators had already been killed or injured in the initial battle, and now, with their law force being drained, another half had their bodies destroyed.

Guo or Jin's eyes finally flashed with a hint of satisfaction.

As long as more law force converged, the array's operation would accelerate, and soon not just the Middle Realm, but the entire True Immortal Realm, would suffer the same fate.

To change the heavens and earth, one needed the power and awareness to destroy the heavens and earth.

Just then, his eyebrows twitched, and he gazed at a region below.

There, Li Yuanji was holding his hands high, with a golden light emanating from his palms, pouring into a small, palm-sized bottle above his head.

The bottle was surrounded by a strange law force, with five-colored light emanating from the mouth of the bottle, forming a hundred-yard-wide, umbrella-like canopy that protected him from the array's effects.

With this protection, he was able to resist the array's influence, and his law force was not drained.

Behind him, over a dozen figures, including Meng Po and Yu Menghan, were also hiding under the five-colored light, their law force intact.

Initially, Meng Po and Yu Menghan had not been controlled by the Dao God Seal, and they had kept their distance from the battlefield. However, when the array was activated, they found themselves unable to escape, and they could only hide behind Li Yuanji.

Li Yuanji had already been overwhelmed, and he had not wanted to protect them. However, with the heavy casualties on both sides, he decided to form a temporary alliance with them.

Using his divine ability, he absorbed the residual power of the God Dao Seal from the bodies of Chi Rong and Chen Ruyan, and the three of them formed a temporary alliance.

"Li Yuanji, you were the last to join the Seven Lords, and your loyalty is the lowest. However, you are also the smartest. Unfortunately, your power is also a crucial part of this array. Come and contribute it to me..." Guo or Jin said with a loud voice.

"Guo or Jin, I had already discovered your unusual behavior, but I didn't expect you to go this far... If you want my power, come and take it yourself." Li Yuanji gritted his teeth and retorted.

Guo or Jin sneered, and without further ado, he used his hand to manipulate the law force, pointing at the wound in the vortex.

A loud rumbling sound came from the vortex, and a gray light suddenly burst out, striking the five-colored light screen that Li Yuanji had created.

The five-colored light screen trembled violently, and its brilliance began to fade rapidly.

Li Yuanji's expression changed, and he quickly said, "If you don't want to die, help me now, and work together to activate this small bottle. This may be our last chance."

He then used his divine voice to inform the others of the method to activate the bottle.

Chi Rong and Chen Ruyan didn't hesitate, and they immediately joined in to help.

Meng Po also used her divine power, transforming it into a misty white light that poured into the bottle, and Yu Menghan, despite his weak power, also joined in, following his master's actions.

The other cultivators, who had been freed from the God Dao Seal's control, also joined in, and their bodies began to glow with light as they guarded Li Yuanji and the small bottle.

Many other cultivators, who had not yet been drained of their law force, were also struggling to reach Li Yuanji's side, putting aside their differences and grievances.

As more and more people joined in, the small bottle's five-colored light finally brightened again, and they managed to temporarily resist the gray light's devouring power.
