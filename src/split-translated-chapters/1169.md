"Prefect Elder, this Han Li is Le Er's brother, how can you treat him so slowly? If others of the Savage Tribes find out, they will surely mock our Tian Huo Tribe's etiquette. You go down first, I will receive this Han Dao friend," the white-clothed man said to the gray-robed elder.

"Tribe Leader, Le Er's current situation... this person's sudden appearance in the Eight Desolate Mountains must be with ulterior motives, beware of him..." the gray-robed elder's expression changed, and he hastily said.

"I have my own plans, you go down first," the white-clothed man raised his hand to stop the gray-robed elder's words, and said.

"Yes." The gray-robed elder still had some resentment, glared at Han Li, and then walked out.

"Han Li, it's been a long time, I didn't expect your cultivation to progress so quickly, it's truly rare," the white-clothed man turned to face Han Li, looked him up and down, and smiled slightly.

"Tribe Leader Liu Qing is too kind, my little bit of strength is hardly worthy of your attention," Han Li cupped his hands and said.

"Oh, you know my name?" Liu Qing's face revealed a hint of surprise.

"I happened to hear it mentioned," Han Li had no intention of mentioning the Gray Boundary, and lightly said.

"Prefect Elder has a few descendants who were killed by human cultivators, so he has deep resentment towards human cultivators, and Le Er is currently busy cultivating a secret technique to prepare for the upcoming Blood Sacrifice Conference, which is a matter of great importance, so Prefect Elder is worried and anxious, hence his extreme behavior, please forgive him," Liu Qing didn't pursue the matter further, and nodded slightly.

"I wouldn't dare," Han Li shook his head.

"Prefect Elder's words may be a bit straightforward, but they are the truth. Han Li, Le Er is no longer the Le Er of the past, to be honest, she carries the Tian Huo Tribe's highest bloodline, and after this Blood Sacrifice Conference, she will soar to even greater heights. Han Dao friend, you may be Le Er's brother, but that's just a mundane matter from the past, and you're just a human cultivator, and you and Le Er will ultimately not be in the same world, do you understand?" Liu Qing's words suddenly turned, and he gazed at Han Li's eyes, slowly saying.

Han Li heard these words, and although his face remained calm, he felt a surge of anger in his heart.

Liu Qing and the gray-robed elder actually treated him as a beggar who saw Liu Le's prosperity and came to ask for benefits based on their past relationship.

To think that since he entered the cultivation world, he had never been looked down upon by anyone like this.

"Your current situation is not good, you clashed with the Qing Yuan Tribe at the city gate, and your identity is about to be exposed, it's only natural to come to Le Er for help, but Le Er needs to focus on her cultivation and can't be disturbed by external matters. So, I can grant you permission to stay in our Tian Huo Tribe until the Blood Sacrifice Conference. During this time, we will ensure your safety, but after the conference, please leave the Eight Desolate Mountains immediately. Of course, if you have any requests, feel free to ask, but you must promise not to entangle with Le Er again in the future..." Liu Qing saw Han Li's silence, and thought he was waiting for a better offer, so he continued.

"Tribe Leader's concerns are unnecessary, Han Li's cultivation may not be high, but he has never coveted others' things, and his safety doesn't require your concern, Han Li's visit to Le Er is purely a reunion of old friends. As for whether we'll meet again in the future, it's up to fate, farewell!" Han Li's temper was good, but he couldn't tolerate it anymore, and coldly interrupted Liu Qing's words, then turned to leave.

Liu Qing's eyebrows furrowed slightly, and a hint of anger flashed in his eyes, his sleeve fluttered as if he was about to do something, but the next moment he stopped, and suddenly looked outside.

Han Li, although walking out, still had his attention on his back, sensing Liu Qing's movement, and he also looked outside, his footsteps hesitating.

At this moment, two figures walked in from outside.

One of them was Li Qi, and the other was a middle-aged man wearing a snow-white long robe, with a face like jade, and sword-like eyebrows, truly handsome and extraordinary, it was the White Zhe True Spirit King.

"Your Majesty! Why did you come? Why didn't you notify me, so I could arrange for someone to welcome you?" Liu Qing quickly stepped forward, and respectfully said to the snow-robed middle-aged man.

"Your Majesty..." Han Li was taken aback, and quickly realized the snow-robed middle-aged man's identity, his face slightly pale.

He had come to the Tian Huo Tribe to investigate the True Spirit King's strength, to decide whether to follow Li Qi to meet him, but unexpectedly, the other party had arrived.

And Han Li looked at the snow-robed middle-aged man, who didn't exude a strong aura, but his heart felt a strange sense of fear.

This kind of situation, Han Li had only experienced with a few people, such as Yin Xiu, the awakened Crab Roadman, and the Demon Master.

"Tribe Leader, don't be too polite, I came this time for a personal matter, so we don't need to follow the usual formalities, and please don't tell anyone about my business here," White Zhe said calmly.

"Yes, I don't know what Your Majesty's business is, I'll immediately take care of it," Liu Qing's expression changed, and he quickly said.

"This matter has little to do with the Tian Huo Tribe, I came to see this Han Xiao friend," White Zhe looked at Han Li, and a hint of a smile appeared on his lips.

Liu Qing heard these words, and was slightly taken aback, looking at Han Li in surprise.

"I am Han Li, greetings to White Zhe," Han Li glanced at Li Qi, and then cupped his hands in a greeting to White Zhe.

On the way to the Eight Desolate Mountains, he had naturally inquired about the True Spirit King's name.
Han Li, I've informed Father King about the matter with Xiao Bai, and he immediately asked me to bring him to see you. Has this caused you any trouble?" Li Qi Ma saw Han Li's gaze and smiled slightly, briefly explaining the reason for their visit.

"Not at all, it's an honor to meet White Marsh, sir. I'm just a humble cultivator," Han Li said with a smile, though his heart was filled with bitterness.

"You've saved my son's life, and our tribe owes you a debt of gratitude. There's no need to be so formal. I've heard you possess the True Spirit bloodline, which has a deep connection to our tribe," White Marsh said with a smile.

"Although I'm a human cultivator with multiple True Spirit bloodlines, I obtained them all in the lower realm. Since ascending to the True Immortal Realm, I've never caused any harm to the tribes of the Barbarian Realm," Han Li said hesitantly.

"Don't worry, Han Li, Father King is already aware of your situation. The greatest enemy of our Barbarian Realm is the Heavenly Court, and you're currently being strictly pursued by them. As the saying goes, 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend.' Moreover, you've done a great service to our Barbarian Realm by returning Xiao Bai to the Eight Desolations Mountain, so you can rest assured," Li Qi Ma said with a smile.

Han Li heard this and saw White Marsh's smiling face, feeling a slight sense of relief.

Liu Qing, who had been listening to the conversation, was shocked and regretful of his previous attitude towards Han Li.

He was thinking about this when he respectfully led White Marsh and Li Qi Ma into the hall and invited White Marsh to take the main seat.

However, Han Li remained standing at the entrance of the hall.

"Han Li, why aren't you coming over to sit?" Li Qi Ma asked, puzzled.

"This is the territory of the Heavenly Fox Tribe, and I'm just a human cultivator. I don't dare to sit randomly, and I'm already lucky to not have been chased away," Han Li said with a sigh.

"What's going on?" Li Qi Ma looked at Liu Qing.

White Marsh also turned to Liu Qing.

"It's just a small matter, Han Li, I had some misunderstandings about you earlier, please forgive me," Liu Qing said hastily, his face flushing with embarrassment.

Han Li smiled coldly in his heart but didn't completely expose Liu Qing's mistake, as Liu Qing's strength far surpassed his own. He bowed his fist and didn't say anything.

"Tribe Leader Liu, I have some matters to discuss with this Han Li, please leave us for now," White Marsh suddenly said, as if this was his own home.

"Yes, sir." Liu Qing didn't show any dissatisfaction and respectfully replied, quickly leaving the hall.

The Heavenly Court had been constantly invading the Barbarian Realm under various pretexts, and the Barbarian tribes relied on White Marsh's leadership to barely hold their ground against the Heavenly Court. White Marsh had become the de facto ruler of the Barbarian Realm, with immense authority.

Liu Qing quickly left the hall and entered a nearby grand hall.

"Tribe Leader, have you dealt with that Han Li? A human cultivator dared to come to the Barbarian Realm and even caused trouble for our Heavenly Fox Tribe. Does he not know the meaning of death? How did you handle him?" The old man in gray robes asked, rushing to greet Liu Qing.

Liu Qing looked at the old man and felt a surge of anger, letting out a heavy hum.

He had been busy in the Heavenly Fox Hall and only heard about Han Li's arrival from his subordinates. He didn't know much about Han Li's situation.

Liu Qing had dismissed the old man earlier, and they had exchanged a brief mental message. He had asked the old man about Han Li's situation and was told that Han Li had simply followed two small Barbarian tribes to the Eight Desolations Mountain, without any special background. Liu Qing had decided to follow the old man's words and chase Han Li away from the Eight Desolations Mountain, not expecting the old man's information to be so inaccurate.

"What's wrong, Tribe Leader?" the old man asked, seeing Liu Qing's expression.

"You said Han Li was just a human cultivator who followed the Silver Horned Rhinoceros Tribe and the Cloud Patterned Tiger Tribe to the Eight Desolations Mountain, without any special background?" Liu Qing asked, his voice low and menacing.

"Yes, that's right. What background could a human cultivator possibly have in the Eight Desolations Mountain? Although he seems to know the young master," the old man replied, hesitating.

"Why didn't you tell me he knew the young master?" Liu Qing asked coldly.

"Well, even if he knows the young master, it's not a big deal. You know the young master's personality, Tribe Leader. He's naive and likes to make friends with people. The king has scolded him for this multiple times. That Han Li is probably just someone the young master met outside, nothing important," the old man said, trying to defend himself.

Liu Qing's face turned ugly, and he suddenly shouted, "You're lying!"

The old man was startled and didn't dare to say anything, standing to the side with his head bowed.
