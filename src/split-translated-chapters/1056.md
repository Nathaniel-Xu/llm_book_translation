At this moment, the ground suddenly flashed yellow, and a yellow figure emerged from the ground with a loud whoosh. It was the burly man with the beard.

His stone armor was now riddled with holes, but he was unharmed, only panting heavily, clearly having had a difficult time navigating the underground tunnels.

"This place is not suitable for a long stay, the ice wall I and Shi Dao set up to block the fire sprites outside won't last long, let's head deeper!" Su Zi gave Han Li a deep look before turning to head into the cave.

The others quickly followed, with Han Li close behind, his eyes fixed on the outside. A strange glint flickered in his eyes.

The sudden agitation of the fire sprites outside was certainly due to some reason, but Han Li's knowledge of them was limited, and he couldn't guess what it was.

The cave was filled with a strange restrictive power that limited the spread of divine sense, and the darkness made it impossible to see very far.

However, the fire sprite army outside could catch up at any moment, so the group didn't dare to linger, moving forward in silence, with Su Zi and Han Li leading the way, casting spells to defend against the small groups of fire sprites that appeared from time to time.

Fortunately, as they went deeper, the number of bug holes on the walls decreased, and the fire sprites became fewer, making it easier for the group to proceed.

After a while, they arrived at a massive cavern.

The fire sprites that had been chasing them stopped at the entrance, circling around but not daring to enter.

Seeing this, the group was initially shocked, then let out a collective sigh of relief.

Han Li glanced at the fire sprites outside, then quickly looked around the cavern.

The cavern was enormous, with an area of several thousand zhang. Half of it was a lake of red-hot magma, with bubbles of fiery red liquid constantly rising and falling, filling the air with a terrifying heat.

The magma emitted a fierce red glow, illuminating the entire cavern.

Above the lake, a red platform connected to another passageway, which was also pitch black, with faint dark red glows emanating from within.

The other half of the cavern was empty, with a series of sharp red stone pillars rising from the ground, like a forest of stone.

The group's eyes scanned the cavern, then simultaneously fixed on the stone pillars.

Because on the three largest pillars, three massive dark red beehives hung, each emitting a fiery glow, and a powerful time law fluctuation.

These three time law fluctuations were enormous, but not concentrated, instead scattered and chaotic, filling the cavern.

The red flames in the magma lake fluctuated with the time law fluctuations, rising and falling in a rhythmic pattern, causing the air to vibrate with a humming sound.

Han Li gazed at the three beehives from a distance, his pupils constricting.

If he wasn't mistaken, these three beehives were the birthplace of the fire sprites outside, and the reason they didn't dare approach was likely due to some sort of rule or restriction, treating this place as a sacred site.

This "sacred site" seemed peaceful, but was certainly not without defenses.

Moreover, the time law fluctuations emanating from the three beehives, combined with their long dormancy, had transformed them into a rare and precious time spirit object.

As Han Li observed the beehives, Su Zi, Jin Liu, and the others were also cautiously observing the surroundings, their eyes filled with a mix of greed and caution.

But there was no lack of people who were eager to take risks for treasure.

Three figures suddenly flew out, each targeting one of the beehives.

One was a gray-haired youth, another a black-robed woman, both from the scattered cultivator group, and the third was the burly man with the beard.

"Lu brother, Qi Dao friend, don't be rash!" The blond youth from the scattered cultivator group shouted, but it was too late.

The gray-haired youth and the black-robed woman had already flown to the beehives, each emitting a beam of light that enveloped the beehive, lifting it up.

The burly man with the beard also flew to the third beehive, landing about ten zhang away, his foot stomping on the ground.

The ground around the beehive flashed yellow, and a massive stone figure emerged, several zhang tall, its stone hand grasping the beehive and pulling it up.

Unexpectedly, the three beehives were lifted with ease, without any difficulty.

The three individuals were initially stunned, then overjoyed, their hands forming seals as they prepared to retrieve the beehives.

But just as they did, a sudden change occurred!

The dark red glow on the beehives suddenly intensified, and the time law fluctuations that had been scattered throughout the cavern suddenly converged on the beehives.

In an instant, a dark red vortex appeared around the beehives, enveloping the three individuals.

The three individuals were clearly prepared, but their movements slowed down, as if trapped in a swamp, their actions slowed by more than tenfold.
At this moment, the three people in the dark red light vortex seemed to be moving in slow motion, giving off an inexplicable sense of eeriness.

Just then, a flash of light appeared on the stone wall above, outlining a shape the size of a millstone.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he saw this, and Su Cai and the others also gasped in unison.

The object, which was the size of a millstone, was a giant firefly, its body structure and outer appearance similar to that of the fireflies outside, except for a flame-shaped pattern on its shell.

The firefly had blended into the surroundings so seamlessly that no one, including Han Li, had noticed it.

The giant firefly's mouth opened, and three streaks of red fire shot out, leaving behind a trail of residual images as they struck the three people with incredible speed.

The gray-haired youth and the black-robed woman were too slow to react, and their bodies were pierced by the red fire, turning them into two human torches that were engulfed in flames.

Their bodies melted away in an instant, leaving behind only ashes.

The burly man's strength was superior to that of the gray-haired youth, and he managed to conjure up a small spiritual domain, barely avoiding the flames that were rushing towards him.

However, the red fire was too fast, and he was unable to dodge it completely, his left arm being pierced by the flames.

A ball of red fire appeared on his arm, burning fiercely, and his arm was reduced to ashes.

The red flames continued to spread, threatening to engulf his entire body.

The burly man's face turned pale, and he retreated, his other hand forming a knife-like shape as he slashed at his shoulder.

But he was still within the dark red light vortex, and his movements were slowed down, making him a step too slow.

Just then, a golden sword shadow flashed towards him, striking his shoulder and severing his left arm.

The arm was immediately engulfed by the red flames, reducing it to ashes.

Han Li, who was hundreds of feet away, silently retracted his finger.

The burly man let out a sigh of relief, and his body glowed with a yellow light as he retreated, his speed increasing rapidly as he flew out of the dark red light vortex.

He turned to Han Li and nodded in gratitude before taking out a yellow and red pill and swallowing it.

In an instant, his severed arm began to heal, and a new arm grew out.

The giant firefly turned towards Han Li, its mouth opening in anger, and it fell from the ceiling, landing on the stone head that the burly man had summoned.

Its claws flashed with red light, and it swiped at the stone head, releasing a half-moon-shaped blade of light that was imbued with the power of time.

The stone head was easily sliced into several pieces, and its body crumbled, turning into a pile of rubble.

The three people who had been attacked earlier were now dead, and the giant firefly's gaze turned towards Han Li and the others.

Su Cai's eyes narrowed as she said, "This should be the Firefly King, capable of manipulating time itself, its power is unimaginably greater than that of ordinary fireflies!"

The Firefly King turned towards Su Cai, its eyes flashing with anger, and it transformed into a red shadow, charging towards her with incredible speed.

It swiped at Su Cai with its claws, releasing two half-moon-shaped blades of light that shot towards her and Han Li.

The blades were incredibly fast, and they appeared in front of the two in an instant.

Han Li's body flickered, and he disappeared from his original position, reappearing hundreds of feet away, leaving the Firefly King stunned.

Su Cai's cultivation was high, but she didn't have Han Li's speed, and she was forced to retreat, her footwork swift as she created some distance between herself and the Firefly King.

She raised her hand, and a blue water light appeared in front of her, transforming into a blue vortex that rotated rapidly, creating a whirlpool that affected the surrounding air.

The red blade of light struck the blue vortex, but it was only slowed down for a moment before breaking through, slicing through the vortex and continuing towards Su Cai.

However, the blade was also deflected by the vortex, and it grazed Su Cai's body, striking the ground and creating a black hole.

The others who had been watching the scene unfold turned pale, and they scattered in all directions, trying to get away from the Firefly King.

"We must work together and not give it any chance to breathe!" Su Cai's forehead was slick with sweat as she shouted.

The others, who were all highly skilled cultivators, knew that they had to act quickly, and they launched a barrage of attacks at the Firefly King.
