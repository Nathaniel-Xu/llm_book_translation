“Wan'er!”

Han Li called out softly, his body slightly leaning forward, his eyes filled with concern.

Nan Gong Wan's eyes still had a hint of confusion, as if she hadn't fully recovered.

Han Li saw this and raised his hand to press a few points, a beam of pure light shooting out and entering Nan Gong Wan's brow.

Nan Gong Wan's mind was suddenly filled with a cool sensation, her consciousness instantly restored.

She sat up abruptly, looking at Han Li in front of her, but her face was expressionless.

“Wan'er, what's wrong, it's me,” Han Li said, reaching out to grasp Nan Gong Wan's hand, but his heart sank, wondering if Jiao San had deceived him, and Nan Gong Wan hadn't recovered her memories from this life.

With a soft "pa" sound, Nan Gong Wan pushed Han Li's hand away.

“Who are you?” Nan Gong Wan's body moved, and she flew up from the bed, landing beside it, her face full of wariness.

“I'm Han Li, your husband,” Han Li said.

“How can you prove your identity?” Nan Gong Wan's gaze flickered, and she immediately returned to her icy demeanor.

Han Li heard this and felt a sense of relief, a smile spreading across his face.

Nan Gong Wan's memories seemed to have truly recovered.

“Wan'er, do you remember when we first met? It was during the Blood Trial, when you were practicing the Wheel of Rebirth, and you were picking herbs in the Blood Trial secret realm, pretending to be a Qi Refining disciple... that wasn't very glorious.” Han Li said with a smile.

Nan Gong Wan listened, her expression unchanged, but a hint of nostalgia flashed in her eyes, only to disappear.

“Later, we were trapped in a predicament, and fortunately, we worked together to defeat the ink dragon, and that's how we formed a bond... the second time we met was on the front lines of the battle against the demonic path, with outsiders present, you pretended not to recognize me...” Han Li paused, continuing to recount their shared experiences.

Although many years had passed, these memories remained vivid, as if they had happened just yesterday.

“...I later passed the Heavenly Tribulation, and we were separated, and I ascended to the True Immortal Realm, and that's how long we've been apart, I thought it would be impossible to reunite in this life.” Han Li's words trailed off as he finished recounting their experiences in the Spirit Realm.

Nan Gong Wan stood beside him, listening quietly, her eyes changing, but she remained calm.

“Wan'er, these are our shared memories, and aside from us, I believe no one else knows them.” Han Li said, his eyes locked onto Nan Gong Wan's, a hint of expectation in his gaze.

“I should have been in your hands, my cultivation is weak, and I couldn't see through your cultivation level, but it's definitely above mine, and searching my soul is a trivial matter, you know these things can't prove anything.” Nan Gong Wan shook her head.

“Wan'er, you're still so cautious, indeed, if I searched your soul, I could know these things, but what do you want me to do to prove my identity?” Han Li was taken aback for a moment, then chuckled, asking.

Nan Gong Wan's face revealed a thoughtful expression.

Han Li smiled, looking at Nan Gong Wan, his expression suddenly changing as he examined her eyes.

Nan Gong Wan's aura at this moment was only at the True Immortal Realm, and Han Li had been so caught up in their reunion that he hadn't noticed this earlier.

It seemed that her memories had recovered, but her cultivation, which had been boosted by the Six Paths Wheel of Rebirth, had disappeared.

“Wan'er, your past self was a Da Luo Realm cultivator, and now your cultivation has dropped to the True Immortal Realm, all because of the Six Paths Wheel of Rebirth. I've investigated, and it won't affect your future cultivation.” Han Li said, his brow furrowed.

“Six Paths Wheel of Rebirth... is that the mysterious artifact controlled by the Wheel of Rebirth's master? That person has a daughter, do you know her?” Nan Gong Wan's eyes sparkled as she asked.

“Wheel of Rebirth's master is called Jiao San, and her real name is Gan Jiuzhen, she's your daughter from your past life. What else do you want to ask, feel free to ask.” Han Li nodded, his expression calm.

“My daughter from my past life? What's going on... and you told me that the master looks... looks just like you?” Nan Gong Wan was taken aback, then asked without hesitation.

Han Li sighed inwardly, recounting the story of the Wheel of Rebirth's master and his own connection, as well as her attempt to use the Wheel of Rebirth to revive Nan Gong Wan's past self.

Nan Gong Wan's expression was initially tense, but after a moment of thought, she returned to her calm demeanor.

In the next moment, she asked a few more questions about the Underworld Realm, which Han Li answered accurately.

“Now you should believe me,” Han Li said, looking at Nan Gong Wan.

“Not necessarily, if you and they colluded to deceive me, it's not impossible.” Nan Gong Wan stubbornly shook her head.

Han Li felt a sense of helplessness, then suddenly thought of a solution.

He pressed a few points, and his body was surrounded by lightning, the 72 Qingtong Fengyun swords appearing, their lightning auras disappearing, revealing the true form of the swords.

“Wan'er, look, these Qingtong Fengyun swords are my original magic tool, you saw them before. Although I've refined them many times over the years, the natural aura of the Golden Bamboo remains.” Han Li said.

Nan Gong Wan stared blankly at the 72 golden swords, her lips moving slightly.

When she looked at Han Li again, her eyes finally changed.

“Also, I've refined this treasure many times, but the marks from back then are still visible.” Han Li said, holding up the Yuanhe Five Peaks.

When Nan Gong Wan's gaze fell on the Five Peaks, her body trembled slightly, her eyes flashing as she looked at Han Li again.

“Other magic tools, I've abandoned them over the years, but some of the cultivation methods and divine abilities I learned in the Spirit Realm, I can still use, such as the Chun Li Sword Array, the Qing Pan Sword Array, and the Nirvana Saint Body Transformation... I still remember which pose you dislike the most...” Han Li's mind was filled with ideas, and he began to recount various methods to prove his identity.

Before he finished speaking, a fragrant breeze swept in, and Nan Gong Wan threw herself into his arms, her arms tightly embracing him, as if using all her strength, her voice whispering:

“Enough, I believe you, you're really Han Li!”
Since regaining her memories in the Underworld, Nangong Wan's strength had greatly decreased, and she was completely unfamiliar with the situation in the True Immortal Realm. The people around her were all incredibly strong, each one surpassing her by a thousand times, making her feel like she was walking on thin ice.

Finally finding Han Li today, she felt a sense of relief wash over her as she caught the familiar scent on his body. Nangong Wan tightly grasped Han Li's arm, her heart filled with a sense of security.

Han Li also wrapped his arms around Nangong Wan's delicate and fragile body, his heart overflowing with love and concern.

Ever since Nangong Wan appeared in the True Immortal Realm, she had been awakened to her past life memories by the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation. Han Li's heart had been filled with anger and helplessness, but he had endured it all, silently leaving her side.

Sometimes, separation was necessary for future reunions.

After learning that Nangong Wan had been captured by the Heavenly Court, Han Li's heart had been filled with anxiety, like being burned by fire.

To gain enough power to rescue Nangong Wan, he had suppressed his emotions and finally achieved a breakthrough in his cultivation.

Until today, Nangong Wan had returned to his side, and the weight on his heart had finally been lifted.

Han Li's eyebrows suddenly twitched, and his emotions underwent a drastic change. His heart was in turmoil, and his divine sense was surging. The Spiritual Refining Technique was operating frantically, causing his mind to feel like it was being turned upside down.

He quickly closed his eyes, guarding his mind, and tried to calm his heart.

Suddenly, he discovered that his Nascent Soul had undergone a subtle yet extraordinary change. This change was almost imperceptible, but it had brought about a profound impact on his cultivation.

His Spiritual Refining Technique, from the first layer to the second, and then to the third, had all been cultivated with the growth of his divine sense. However, this powerful energy had not been fully integrated into his mind, and it seemed to be in a state of chaos.

Although he could unify this energy through the Spiritual Refining Technique, it would immediately return to its chaotic state once he stopped.

But in that moment, this energy seemed to have found a common foundation.

It was as if his fragmented soul had finally found its home, and his Nascent Soul had returned to his body.

He felt a sense of completeness and unity with his Nascent Soul, as if he had been reborn.

Moreover, Han Li was delighted to find that his seventh-layer Spiritual Refining Technique was nearing perfection.

Nangong Wan sensed the change in Han Li's emotions and gently left his embrace.

"What's wrong, husband?" she asked.

"Nothing, I just felt a sense of joy when I saw you recover," Han Li replied, smiling, and wrapped his arms around Nangong Wan's delicate body once more.

Nangong Wan also tightened her grip on Han Li's arms.

The two of them stood there, embracing each other, and after a long time, they finally let go, smiling at each other as if they had returned to their past.

"Husband, I'm sorry for doubting you earlier and making you prove yourself in various ways," Nangong Wan said, her face filled with regret.

"It's nothing, you're always cautious, and it's only natural," Han Li replied, smiling, and put away the Qingtian Bee Cloud Sword and the Yuhe Five Extremes Mountain.

"You've been in the True Immortal Realm for many years, what have you experienced? I've heard bits and pieces from Gan Jiuzhen and the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation, and it seems you've become quite renowned in the immortal realm," Nangong Wan asked, looking at Han Li.

"I haven't done anything remarkable, just been forced to flee from various people and experienced some things along the way," Han Li said, shaking his head.

"You've been cautious for half your life, but now that we're together again, do you still need to be so low-key?" Nangong Wan asked, her eyes sparkling with amusement. "Tell me, where do you rank in terms of strength among the immortals in the True Immortal Realm?"

"If I had to say, the strongest in the True Immortal Realm would be the Time Dao Ancestor, and the second strongest would be the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation... As for me, I'd say I'm around the top ten," Han Li replied, smiling.

"Ah, you're still the same Han Li who dominated the Spiritual Realm!" Nangong Wan exclaimed, her eyes shining with excitement. "Tell me everything, don't hide anything from me. I also have a gift for you."

Nangong Wan tossed a half-block of green jade pendant, which sparkled like water, with a slender figure etched onto its surface.

Han Li caught the pendant and was taken aback.

The figure on the pendant was none other than Ziling, and the pendant she had given him in the past had Nangong Wan's figure on it.

"Since we're both in the True Immortal Realm now, some things can be done," Nangong Wan said, smiling. "Don't worry about it, just tell me everything."

"Very well, I'll tell you," Han Li said, and began to recount his experiences in the True Immortal Realm, from his arrival in the North Cold Immortal Domain to his various adventures.

He glossed over some of the more unpleasant or shocking aspects of his journey, as well as his encounters with Ziling.

However, he did tell Nangong Wan about the Palm of Heaven Bottle, which had been his constant companion throughout his cultivation journey and his greatest reliance during his ascension to the True Immortal Realm.

Nangong Wan listened to Han Li's tale with wide eyes, her face filled with a mix of emotions. She was delighted by his bravery and worried about his safety, and her eyes sparkled with joy when she heard about his triumphs.

Han Li, who had long since abandoned his mortal heart, had always reserved a portion of his true self for Nangong Wan.

Only in her presence could he truly be himself.
