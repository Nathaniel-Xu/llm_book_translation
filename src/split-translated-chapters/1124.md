Han Li and the others had never seen such a spectacle before, a Da Luo realm cultivator chasing after a large golden beetle like a common street vendor.

Qu Xian tried to beg for mercy several times, but before he could even finish speaking, he was beaten senseless by the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor's sudden and merciless attacks.

The onlookers were stunned, and they hastily dodged to the side to avoid being caught in the crossfire.

Because the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor had previously forbidden them from leaving, they didn't dare to venture too far, lest they incur his wrath. They could only awkwardly dodge and weave, looking utterly ridiculous.

Just then, a white light flashed from afar, and a middle-aged man in a blue robe appeared, riding a Lichi horse.

Upon seeing this man, Han Li, Huo San, and Jiao San's faces lit up with joy.

However, Qi Mozi's expression turned grave, and his eyes flashed with a hint of unease.

"Black Heaven, please spare him," the blue-robed man said, waving his hand to send a gray-white light towards the golden beetle, which had been knocked flying once again.

But the golden beetle's momentum was too great, and it shattered the gray-white light, crashing into a nearby wall with a loud "thud". The wall, already damaged, collapsed entirely.

"Lyu Zi, you old fellow, what brings you here? Do you think you can interfere with my affairs?" the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor asked, his expression gleeful as he beat Qu Xian senseless.

"Ha ha, I came to congratulate you on your escape, Stone," Lyu Zi said, bowing. "My Benming Yuanpai is here, and now that the Years Lamp's seal has been broken, I've come to retrieve it."

Lyu Zi's gaze swept towards the five-colored altar inside the temple, but his expression faltered as he took in the devastation.

The five-colored altar was now nothing but a pile of rubble.

Lyu Zi's eyes turned towards the others, and his gaze landed on Qi Mozi. His expression turned grave, and he seemed to be searching for something.

His Lichi horse also scanned the area, its brow furrowed as it failed to detect the Benming Yuanpai's location.

"You'll have to wait your turn, Lyu Zi," the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor said. "I still have business to attend to. You can search for your treasure later. Don't interfere with my affairs for now."

Lyu Zi's mention of Lyu Qi's name sparked a realization in Han Li. He recalled that Lyu Zi's techniques were identical to Lyu Qi's, and that Lyu Qi had been the one to sever Lyu Zi's three corpses.

Han Li shook his head, focusing on the present situation. His eyes darted towards Huo San, and he mouthed a few words.

Huo San nodded almost imperceptibly.

The Black Heaven Demon Ancestor's beating of Qu Xian continued, until the golden beetle was battered and bruised, its body covered in fist-sized indentations and golden blood flowing from its seven orifices.

Lyu Zi intervened, begging the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor to spare Qu Xian's life.

The Black Heaven Demon Ancestor relented, and Lyu Zi took advantage of the opportunity to retrieve the golden beetle.

As Lyu Zi turned to leave, he caught sight of Huo San and his eyes widened in surprise.

"Stone, I didn't know you had plans to rescue your wife and son," Lyu Zi said, his eyes gleaming with interest. "How did you find their whereabouts?"

Qi Mozi's eyes narrowed, and he subtly withdrew his hand into his sleeve.
The old man pointed at Qí Mó Zǐ and said, "This friend told me that he would bring me to find Jīn Líng and the others."

Lǐu Zì Zài's eyebrows rose, and he exclaimed, "How could you trust this person, don't you know that he is the current master of the Heavenly Prison?"

Qí Mó Zǐ hastily defended himself, "I'm not a person from the Heavenly Court, I swear..."

Lǐu Zì Zài waved his hand, and a gray-white light flew out, transforming into a gray-white sphere. The sphere showed a scene of Qí Mó Zǐ previously collaborating with the White Bone Demon and the Copper Lion Demon, and the image of him taking out the Prison Master's token was clear. The sphere also transmitted the voices of the three people, without omitting a single word.

The old man's face turned cold as iron, and he glared at Qí Mó Zǐ. "You dare to deceive me?"

At that moment, a golden light burst forth from Qí Mó Zǐ's body, expanding rapidly and forming a golden domain. The domain was filled with flames-like spiritual light, and it was the Duan Shi Huo Jing, which enveloped everyone.

Everything within the Duan Shi Huo Jing suddenly froze, and everyone's bodies became immobile. However, Qí Mó Zǐ's body transformed into a golden light, and he flew out of the Taì Suì Temple ruins, shooting towards the distance.

The old man roared, "You think you can trap me with your Duan Shi Huo Jing?" His body emitted a massive amount of black light, which tore through the Duan Shi Huo Jing.

He reached out with his hand, and the sky outside the temple shook with a deafening roar. A massive black hand, covering half of the sky, reappeared, and it grasped towards Qí Mó Zǐ.

A massive force pressed down on Qí Mó Zǐ from all sides, reducing his speed. He was about to be caught by the black hand when he suddenly flashed with golden light, and his speed increased. The golden light enveloped the surrounding space, illuminating it like daylight.

The next moment, a massive golden light sphere, hundreds of feet in size, appeared. The sphere was covered in golden flames, resembling a golden sun, and it shot towards the black hand.

The two forces collided, causing a massive explosion. The black hand was blocked by the golden light sphere, and after a brief moment, it shattered and dissipated.

Qí Mó Zǐ's body fell from the light sphere, and he vomited blood from his seven orifices. He held onto the lotus-shaped candle tightly, and its spiritual light was much dimmer than before.

Qí Mó Zǐ muttered a few words, and his body stabilized. He turned around and continued to fly towards the distance.

However, the golden light sphere did not disappear. Instead, it expanded rapidly, and thin golden flames burst forth from it, piercing through the black hand and creating numerous small holes. The black hand, which was once so powerful, suddenly disintegrated.

The old man looked at the golden light sphere, his face filled with excitement, and he seemed to have forgotten about Qí Mó Zǐ.

The golden light sphere shrank, and a golden figure with a high crown appeared. Although its face was unclear, it radiated a powerful aura.

Léi Yù Cè and the others, who were hiding in the corner of the temple, saw the figure and were greatly encouraged.

"It's our ancestor!"

"All these years, our ancestor never truly left this tower that intimidates all demons and monsters!"

As they spoke, Léi Yù Cè and the others bowed towards the golden figure from afar.

The old man's face turned cold and serious, and he said, "I see, I was wondering why the candle's power was so great, even without anyone controlling it. It's because it contains a remnant of your spirit, Wén Tài Suì!"

The golden figure looked at the old man, its face solemn, and it did not speak.

The next moment, the black and gold lights on the two figures burst forth, and their massive auras collided in the air.

The already damaged Taì Suì Temple collapsed, but the ground remained intact, as if protected by the Five Elements Array.

Hán Lì and the others were blown away by the two massive auras and flew to a distant location, far away from the old man and the golden figure.
