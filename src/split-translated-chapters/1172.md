Han Li's gaze swept around, and he flew down to an empty space near the medicine garden, waving his hand to take out various materials and begin smelting them. Soon, he constructed a massive golden platform several hundred meters in size.

Next, he took out various materials and began to refine array instruments.

Han Li had long been planning to set up the Guang Yin Tian Xuan Great Array, so when he had sold his spiritual materials and treasures last time, he had deliberately kept the materials needed for the array.

Although the Guang Yin Tian Xuan Great Array was an ancient great array that required a vast amount of materials, Han Li had previously plundered the Tai Sui Immortal's mansion and obtained countless resources, enough to set up the array.

Just as Han Li was setting up the Guang Yin Tian Xuan Great Array, in the circular great hall at the peak of the Ba Huang Mountains.

Bai Ze stood in front of the dark red fire pit, staring at the cluster of golden flames, which reflected in his pupils and flickered lightly.

A figure walked in from outside, and it was Li Qi Ma.

"Father King, just now, news arrived from the mountain below that Han Li has agreed to stay." Li Qi Ma walked to Bai Ze's side and said softly.

"Good, you order them to satisfy all his requests, no matter what they are, and make sure he stays until the Blood Sacrifice Conference ends." Bai Ze turned around and said.

"Yes." Li Qi Ma's eyes flashed, and he replied.

"Alright, you go down and attend to your duties." Bai Ze waved his hand, and then turned back to face the dark red fire pit.

"Father King, Han Li is just a human cultivator, why do you want to keep him in the Ba Huang Mountains? If his identity is exposed, and the various tribes find out that we are harboring a human cultivator, won't that create trouble?" Li Qi Ma didn't leave immediately, hesitating for a moment before asking.

"Are you worried that I will harm your friend?" Bai Ze didn't turn around, but smiled slightly.

"Your Majesty, I don't dare, you have a broad heart, and you won't do such things." Li Qi Ma quickly bowed his head.

"You have a good heart, and you are loyal to your friends, which is one of the qualities a king should have. However, to become the True Spirit King, you need another quality, which is to know when to make sacrifices. As the True Spirit King, everything must be done for the benefit of the tribe, and friendships must be sacrificed if necessary." Bai Ze continued.

"Father King, you..." Li Qi Ma's face changed suddenly.

"You don't need to worry, it's not time for you to make sacrifices yet. Moreover, I am keeping Han Li in the Ba Huang Mountains not with malicious intent, but rather to give him an opportunity. It's just not the right time to tell you, so don't ask." Bai Ze patted Li Qi Ma's shoulder and smiled.

Li Qi Ma looked at Bai Ze's familiar figure, but suddenly felt a sense of unfamiliarity and distance, and couldn't see through his intentions.

"Alright, there's still much to prepare for the Blood Sacrifice Conference, you go down and attend to your duties." Bai Ze waved his hand.

"Yes, I'll take my leave." Li Qi Ma bowed and left.

...

Half a year passed quickly.

In the flower branch space, the golden platform was now densely covered with array patterns, and various array instruments were embedded within, forming an extremely complex great array, which was the Guang Yin Tian Xuan Great Array.

Han Li inserted the last Xian Yuan Stone into the array, and then stood up, pointing at the array with his finger.

The Guang Yin Tian Xuan Great Array suddenly emitted a fiery golden light, humming as it operated.

A massive golden light pillar shot up from the array, majestic and awe-inspiring, and the time force in the surrounding void began to change.

Han Li's face revealed a hint of joy, and after half a year of hard work, and using countless precious materials, he had finally set up the ancient great array.

Han Li then pointed at the array again, and a series of green lights shot out, falling onto the ground near the platform, which were array flags, and array disks, and in an instant, he had set up a green array.

He then waved his sleeve, and a green glow flashed, and a large pile of Xian Yuan Stones appeared within the green array.

The green array immediately began to hum, and a whirlwind-like green light shot out, carrying the Xian Yuan Stones into the Guang Yin Tian Xuan Great Array.

The Xian Yuan Stones were immediately absorbed, and transformed into pure yuan qi, which was injected into the array.

The golden light emitted by the Guang Yin Tian Xuan Great Array suddenly intensified, and the golden light pillar rose, becoming thicker and more dense, and golden symbols floated within, emitting a sharp whistling sound.

Han Li saw this, and nodded secretly, waving his hand to release a golden light, which enveloped an object and flew into the golden light pillar within the array, where it floated, and it was the Jun Tian Ri Gui.

He stared at the Jun Tian Ri Gui within the light pillar, his eyes flashing with anticipation.

The Jun Tian Ri Gui was enveloped by the golden light, and the golden symbols within the array swarmed towards it, merging with it.

The Jun Tian Ri Gui trembled slightly, as if awakening from a long slumber, and a faint golden light appeared on its surface, flickering weakly.

Han Li saw this, and his face lit up with joy, and his hands quickly pointed at the array, urging the Guang Yin Tian Xuan Great Array to operate.

The golden symbols within the array surged forward, gathering towards the Jun Tian Ri Gui.

But no matter how Han Li urged the Guang Yin Tian Xuan Great Array, or increased the amount of Xian Yuan Stones, the golden light on the Jun Tian Ri Gui's surface remained dim, and didn't move, displaying its power to change the flow of time.

"It's really not possible..." he sighed.

Without the power of the Time Laws, it was indeed impossible to activate the Jun Tian Ri Gui.
Han Li's eyes widened as he gazed at the golden light within the Temporal Heaven Array, which was dancing like a flame. Suddenly, a thought struck him.

"How could I have forgotten this treasure? Perhaps..." Han Li's hand moved swiftly, and a golden light flashed as he produced an object - the Ageless Divine Lamp.

The Ageless Divine Lamp's golden flame flickered, emitting intense temporal law fluctuations.

Han Li placed the Ageless Divine Lamp on the other side of the Temporal Heaven Array, murmuring incantations and manipulating the seals.

The golden flame surged, forming a massive fire pillar that merged with the Temporal Heaven Array.

Over the years, Han Li had continually refined the Ageless Divine Lamp, and his control over it had become increasingly adept.

The Temporal Heaven Array, however, was like a starving beast that had been fed a massive tonic. It suddenly brightened, its operational speed increasing several times over, and it began to devour the golden flame of the Ageless Divine Lamp.

The array's patterns flashed wildly, and golden light spheres shot out, containing countless golden runes that emitted intense temporal law fluctuations. These spheres flew towards the Heavens' Sundial, merging with it.

The Heavens' Sundial burst forth with a brilliant golden light, its golden pointer spinning rapidly.

Golden light waves emanated from the Heavens' Sundial, filling the Flower Branch Space.

The flow of time within the Flower Branch Space suddenly accelerated, increasing by over five hundred times. This was even faster than the time flow within the True Speech Sect's restricted area.

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise, and he burst into laughter.

He had only taken out the Ageless Divine Lamp to test its effects, but he had not expected the Temporal Heaven Array to be so powerful. It had actually managed to extract temporal law energy from the Ageless Divine Lamp, activating the Heavens' Sundial.

Furthermore, the effects of the Ageless Divine Lamp's energy were even more impressive than the True Speech Sect's Sumeru Golden Mountain.

After his initial excitement, Han Li quickly calmed down and began to chant incantations. He made a series of hand seals, and the Temporal Heaven Array's operational speed slowed significantly. The rate at which it devoured the Ageless Divine Lamp's flame decreased, and the speed at which the adjacent blue array consumed the Celestial Yuan Stones also slowed.

As a result, the Heavens' Sundial's pointer slowed down by ten times, and the flow of time within the Flower Branch Space became about fifty times faster than the outside world.

The Ageless Divine Lamp was a third-grade immortal artifact, containing a significant amount of temporal law energy. However, Han Li was unsure of the exact amount and decided to conserve it.

Moreover, the lamp's power was immense, and it was one of his most treasured possessions. He could not let the Temporal Heaven Array drain it completely.

The accelerated time flow within the Flower Branch Space was already sufficient.

Han Li then turned his attention to the adjacent blue array, where the Celestial Yuan Stones were being consumed at an alarming rate.

He had initially possessed seven million Celestial Yuan Stones, which would have lasted him a long time. However, with the Temporal Heaven Array's insatiable hunger, he was now worried that he would run out of stones.

Fortunately, based on the current rate of consumption, neither the Ageless Divine Lamp's energy nor the Celestial Yuan Stones seemed to be a pressing concern.

Han Li took a deep breath, dismissing his worries, and sat down cross-legged. He took out the Heaven-Defying Sword Chart and began to study it intently.

Time flew by, and two years passed in the blink of an eye. Within the Flower Branch Space, however, over a hundred years had elapsed.

The Heaven-Defying Sword Chart floated above Han Li's head, emitting a gentle, soothing glow that enveloped his body.

The chart displayed a multitude of sword silhouettes, varying in size and shape, which flashed and changed rapidly. Suddenly, Han Li's eyes snapped open, and two beams of light shot out from his eyes, merging with the Heaven-Defying Sword Chart.

The chart's sword silhouettes began to flash wildly, merging with each other at an incredible speed. In an instant, the countless sword silhouettes disappeared, leaving only thirty-six sword silhouettes that trembled gently.

Han Li's face revealed a hint of joy.

After a hundred years of study, he had finally grasped the essence of the Heaven-Defying Sword Chart.

Han Li took a deep breath, suppressing his excitement, and made a series of hand seals. A golden light flashed on his body, and thirty-six Azure Bamboo Cloud Swords shot out.

The swords seemed to be influenced by the Heaven-Defying Sword Chart, as their blades shone brightly, and massive golden lightning bolts erupted from them, shooting in all directions.

Han Li ignored the scattered sword energy and lightning bolts, focusing on the Heaven-Defying Sword Chart. He made another hand seal, and the thirty-six Azure Bamboo Cloud Swords flew towards the chart, merging with the thirty-six sword silhouettes.
