Inside the grand hall, both sides clashed and fought, the sound of the battle was astonishing, but if one were to compare the intensity of the fight, it would be the confrontation between the Rabbit Head Mask and the Pure Jun True Person that was the most intense.

The Pure Jun True Person's face was solemn, his body surrounded by a golden aura, his every movement creating countless sword shadows that flew out, his sharp and unmatched sword energy filled the entire grand hall.

The Rabbit Head Mask, on the other hand, was surrounded by a heavy black aura, creating various illusions that transformed and changed like a kaleidoscope, and at the same time, they flew towards the Pure Jun True Person, who was surrounded by sharp sword energy that cut through the illusions, only to have them disappear instantly.

Han Li's eyes sparkled as he watched this scene, he had seen this before in the Taishou Immortal's Manor.

"Shi Kongmo, you've actually joined the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall and are now an enemy of the Nine Yuan Sect, could it be that you want to trigger another war between the Nine Yuan Sect and the Devil Realm?" the Pure Jun True Person roared.

"Enemy? I'm looking for my wife and son, you're not bad, but compared to me, you're still far inferior, hurry up and get out of the way," the Rabbit Head Mask laughed loudly, his hands waving wildly.

The heavy black aura surrounding him suddenly intensified, forming a ten-meter radius spiritual domain that pressed down on the Pure Jun True Person.

The Pure Jun True Person's face revealed a look of surprise, and then he saw the spiritual domain flying towards him, his hands rapidly forming a seal, the sword shadows around him also intensifying, forming a golden spiritual domain, but only seven or eight meters in size.

The countless golden sword shadows in the golden spiritual domain flashed and collided with the spiritual domain.

A thunderous explosion shook the air, and the nearby space was shattered.

"Indeed, it's this old guy..." Han Li thought to himself.

Back then, the Jiao San took Shi Kongmo away, and who knows what they used to persuade him, but he was brought here.

"But, why did their spiritual domains only open up such a small range?" Han Li wondered.

The Rabbit Head Mask laughed loudly, his hands waving wildly, and the spiritual domain inside him suddenly appeared, with over a dozen substantial black claws floating inside, grasping towards the Pure Jun True Person, the claws wrapped in dark energy.

The Pure Jun True Person's face changed, and he rapidly formed a seal.

The golden sword shadows in his spiritual domain flew out, cutting towards the black claws, but the black claws were like illusions, passing through the golden sword shadows and flying towards the Pure Jun True Person, who was scratched and stumbled backward.

"Ah, so weak, it's really disappointing!" Shi Kongmo said, shaking his head.

" Sect Master!" Yang Junzi, Lei Jun True Person, saw this scene and his face changed, his hands slowing down.

"Jiao San!" Wu Yang's eyes lit up, his hands rapidly forming a seal, and he shouted loudly.

His body glowed with golden light, and a golden circular wheel appeared behind him, spinning rapidly, it was the True Word Wheel, which had already taken shape.

Wu Yang's body also floated a golden spiritual domain, with countless circular wheel shadows flashing.

Jiao San seemed to understand Wu Yang's intention, and her hands rapidly formed a seal, her body surging with layers of dark red light, instantly forming a dark red spiritual domain.

The two spiritual domains merged, and immediately lit up, vibrating like a resonance.

Jiao San's face was solemn, her hands rapidly forming a seal.

A loud explosion shook the air, and a dark red circular wheel, the size of a house, appeared from the spiritual domain, with six black holes, spinning rapidly, emitting a vast and terrifying aura.

Wu Yang flew over to Jiao San's side, his hands forming a seal.

The True Word Wheel behind him flew out, merging with the dark red circular wheel.

The dark red circular wheel suddenly grew larger, with golden talismanic patterns appearing on its surface, emitting a thread of time law, which resonated with the wheel of reincarnation law on the dark red circular wheel.

Outside the grand hall, Han Li saw this scene, and apart from feeling surprised, he also felt a subtle sense of loss.

Only his time law could previously resonate with Jiao San's wheel of reincarnation law, but now Wu Yang could also do it.

However, Han Li quickly threw away this thought, Wu Yang cultivated the True Word Wheel Scripture, and it was only natural that he could resonate with Jiao San's wheel of reincarnation law.

But the resonance of their laws was not very harmonious, and seemed to be not as smooth as when he and Jiao San worked together.

"Go!" Jiao San pushed her hand forward.

The dark red circular wheel rolled out, with a momentum that could move mountains, striking the golden altar.

A series of loud explosions shook the air, and the golden men in front were struck by the dark red circular wheel, immediately shattering like dry wood, unable to withstand the dark red circular wheel at all.

This series of events seemed complex, but in reality, it was all over in an instant.

Yang Junzi and Lei Jun True Person saw this scene, their faces changed, and they silently blamed themselves for being distracted, and their hands rapidly formed seals.
Actually, Yang Junzi and Lei Junzhen had already reached the late stage of the Daluo realm, and it was originally not possible for them to become distracted. However, Shi Kongmo's cultivation was based on heart magic, which could subtly influence people's minds.

Jiao San, Wu Yang, and the others knew about Shi Kongmo's divine ability and had already prepared defensive treasures on their bodies. Yang Junzi and Lei Junzhen were unaware of this and had no defenses, which was why they were affected and became distracted at the critical moment, giving Jiao San and Wu Yang an opportunity.

As the two of them cast their spells, the golden array around the altar suddenly lit up, and countless golden runes shot out from the ground, merging into the array.

The golden man inside the array suddenly had golden patterns appear on his body, and his body expanded significantly. The sword in his hand shone with golden light, and he swung it downwards.

A massive sword light and saber glow shot out, weaving together into a golden net that radiated a brilliant golden light, blocking the dark red circle.

A thunderous sound echoed through the air!

The dark red circle, like a falling star, crashed into the golden net, and the two colors of light clashed, creating a whirlwind of white, misty air. At the same time, a dark light flashed, and a spatial rift appeared, shooting out in all directions.

The sound of "hiss" filled the entire hall.

The dark red circle's light flickered, and it continued to rotate, like a giant grindstone.

The golden net shook violently, emitting a crisp sound like shattering porcelain, and it began to break apart.

Yang Junzi and Lei Junzhen hastily cast their spells, but despite having the advantage of terrain, they were no match for Jiao San and Wu Yang's synchronized spellcasting.

The dark red circle paused for a moment before continuing to roll forward, easily crushing the golden man and rushing towards the altar like a bolt of lightning.

Yang Junzi and Lei Junzhen tried to block it, but it was too late. However, their expressions did not show any panic.

A dark red shadow flashed by, and the giant circle reached the altar, striking it with tremendous force.

But at that moment, the air around the altar began to fluctuate, and a dark light emerged from the void, condensing into a ball-shaped black light shield that enveloped the altar.

The dark red circle struck the black light shield, emitting a loud "clang"!

The black light shield rippled, and the area that was hit slightly indented.

However, the dark red circle's attack had no further effect, and it remained motionless despite its continued rotation and impact.

"You, Wheel of Reincarnation, launched a massive assault on our Nine Yuan Sect's strongholds, drawing attention away, while secretly sending a master to infiltrate the Nine Yuan Palace. What a clever move! But you didn't expect the Xuan Yuan Dark Light Shield, did you? This restriction was set up by my ancestor, the Xuan Yuan Daozu. You think you can break through with just a few people? It's simply absurd!" Chun Junzhen retreated into the air, took out a blood-red pill, and swallowed it, healing his wounds instantly. He sneered, "You..."

Lei Junzhen smiled, and Yang Junzi's face also showed a smile. They raised their hands, about to do something.

Just then, a figure appeared in front of Lei Junzhen, and it was Lu Chuanfeng.

Without seeing him move, countless blue lights burst out from his body, each emitting an icy aura, like raindrops shooting towards Lei Junzhen.

A chill filled the air, making everyone's teeth chatter.

On the other side, Yang Junzi's figure flashed, and Wu Yang appeared, swinging his hands.

A golden palm shadow appeared above Yang Junzi's head, striking down like a tidal wave.

In the air, Shi Kongmo was also using his full strength to activate his spiritual domain, forcing Chun Junzhen to retreat repeatedly.

Just then, Jiao San's figure flashed, and he appeared near the altar, taking out an object and throwing it.

"That is..." Han Li's eyes widened.

Jiao San had thrown out the black iron plate he had obtained from the Suiyue Xianfu.

"Xuan Yuan Black Command! How did you get this?" Chun Junzhen's face turned pale, and his smile disappeared.

He moved to fly downwards, but it was too late.

"Haha, Cow Nose, you think you can switch opponents? Come, let's fight another three hundred rounds!" Shi Kongmo laughed, pointing his finger.

Chun Junzhen's figure flashed, and countless ghostly claws appeared, grabbing at him.

Chun Junzhen had to stop and cast a spell to defend himself.

Lu Chuanfeng and Wu Yang also went all out, entangling Lei Junzhen and Yang Junzi.

At this moment, Jiao San spat out a mouthful of blood essence, which transformed into a blood light that merged into the black iron plate. He then quickly formed a hand seal.

The iron plate ignited with a black flame, and it was drawn out by Jiao San's hand seal, transforming into a black fire sword that struck the Xuan Tian Dark Light Shield.

The shield, which had seemed impenetrable, suddenly became fragile, and a long, narrow opening appeared.

Jiao San's figure flashed, and he flew into the opening, his hand grasping at the void.

The altar's top flashed, and a dark red hand appeared, grasping the cloud that had transformed into a fire-red color.

Chun Junzhen and the others let out a furious roar, but they were powerless to stop it.

But just as they were about to succeed, a sudden change occurred!
