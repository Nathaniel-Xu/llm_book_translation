Dongfang Bai's eyebrows furrowed slightly as he listened to the old man's words, and with a subtle movement of his fingers, a golden light shot out from his palm, retrieving the jade slips and examining them one by one.

As he looked through the slips, his eyebrows became increasingly furrowed, and his expression grew more and more solemn.

"Are you certain? Do the jade slips really say the same thing?" Dongfang Bai asked after a moment, his voice heavy with concern.

"Reporting to the Palace Master, I have sent out all the spies under my command over the past hundred years, and although they are not particularly skilled, they have some ability to gather information. We started our investigation in the Northern Cold Immortal Domain, and what we found was surprising. It seems that this Han Li was once within the sight of the Northern Cold Immortal Palace when they were eliminating the Candle Dragon Sect's Bai Li." Lü Yun's voice was sharp and clear as he spoke.

"My son, Tao Yu, was killed by him during that time." Tao Ji's face was filled with pain as he spoke.

"It's likely that he obtained his time law from the Candle Dragon Sect's 'True Word Transformation Wheel Scripture'." Dongfang Bai said calmly, not paying attention to Tao Ji.

"That's right, in the messages that followed, the name 'Lü Fei Yu' appeared several times, but each time the information was vague, as if he was intentionally hiding his tracks. Apart from that, there was also a name 'Lü Han' that appeared, and some of its characteristics match Han Li's, it's likely another one of his aliases." Lü Yun nodded and continued.

"How is this possible? If we look at the information presented in the jade slips, Han Li has spent so many years, and his footprints are already all over the Northern Cold, Black Mountain, Black Earth, Barbarian, and Golden Source Immortal Domains. And from a temporal perspective, it seems that he has a connection to many of the major events that occurred in those regions." Dongfang Bai's expression was one of doubt.

"According to our investigation, the Candle Dragon Sect's destruction, the emergence of the Ming Han Immortal Palace, and the reopening of the True Word Sect's ruins, all of these events seem to be connected to him, and there is evidence to prove that he was involved. Moreover, the death of the Gongshu family's Gongshu Tian brothers also seems to be related to him." Lü Yun spoke slowly and calmly.

Dongfang Bai's expression grew more and more solemn as he listened, and after a moment of contemplation, he asked:

"What happened after the True Word Sect's ruins were reopened? Where did he go? Why did he suddenly appear in our Golden Source Immortal Domain?"

"Palace Master, please take a look at this." Lü Yun said, taking out another jade slip and handing it to Dongfang Bai.

"This is not the report of the Feng Qing Shui Dao Zu's journey to the Gray Boundary?" Dongfang Bai took the slip and quickly examined it, his eyes filled with doubt.

"It seems that many people who appeared in the True Word Sect's ruins also appeared in the Gray Boundary. So, I think that Han Li likely went there, and then somehow ended up in the Demon Realm, before returning to the Immortal Realm, which led to the events that followed." Lü Yun said, glancing at Tao Ji.

As he finished speaking, the hall fell silent, and everyone present fell into deep thought.

Tao Ji's face turned pale, and then he seemed to think of something, and his forehead began to sweat, his expression one of fear.

"This person has a close relationship with the Reincarnation Hall, and is able to move freely between the different realms, and yet he has not been injured, and his cultivation has been rapidly increasing. What do you think?" Dongfang Bai leaned forward, his eyes scanning the room, his expression serious.

"Without mentioning his current strength, just his speed of progress is alarming, and it's clear that his identity is not simple. To be able to connect with the Reincarnation Hall and the Demon Clan, his background is likely not simple." Hei Dao spoke up after a long silence.

Han Li, if he were present, would likely be laughing and crying at the same time, for he had never imagined that these people would come to such a conclusion after their analysis.

"So, does this mean that I have provoked an existence that I am not capable of dealing with?" Tao Ji's face was filled with regret after a moment of thought.

"Palace Master..." Lü Yun bowed slightly, speaking slowly.

Hei Dao did not speak, but it was clear that he was waiting for Dongfang Bai to make a decision.

Dongfang Bai stood up from the Golden Dragon Throne, his eyes fixed on the ground, his mind racing.

After a long moment of contemplation, he stopped pacing and looked at the others, saying:

"No matter what his cultivation is, or what his background is, as long as it is related to that thing, I want you to pursue it to the end. Once you find his trail, do not act rashly, report back to me, and I will make the necessary arrangements."

"What if we encounter conflict?" Lü Yun asked.

"If we encounter conflict, do not retreat, you can first try not to kill him... naturally, try to capture him alive, and once you understand the situation, bring him back to the Nine Yuan Tower to be dealt with." Dongfang Bai said.

"Understood..." Lü Yun and the others replied, their voices hesitant.

"Remember, this matter is only to be discussed among you, if anyone leaks the information to the Heavenly Court's inspectors, do not blame me for not being able to protect you." Dongfang Bai's expression was stern, his voice cold.

"Yes!" This time, the three of them replied quickly, without hesitation.

After they left, Dongfang Bai paced back and forth in the hall, his mind filled with a growing sense of unease.
He was also the first to encounter someone like Han Li, who was so peculiar that despite his incredible strength and background, he was still able to keep a low profile and hide his tracks so well.

Moreover, the snakes and grass, the hidden dangers, were all still unknown to him, and what was revealed to him was only a small part of Han Li's true nature.

A person like this, who had not been truly noticed by the Heavenly Court, was truly terrifying.

...

The Middle Earth Immortal Domain.

A vast, unknown void space, with floating blood-red clouds.

The sky was shrouded in a thick, bloody aura, and in the distance, one could see a series of black buildings with curved, twisted architecture, protruding from the blood-red clouds.

The blood clouds seemed to be layered, with the highest layer being the thickest.

At the bottom of the blood clouds, a white stone archway stood tall, with two large, blood-red characters carved into it: "Xian Prison".

A faint, clear sound echoed through the air, as a large, black temple stood nearby, its eaves curved like a flying bird.

On the temple's roof, a pair of cow-sized, eight-sided bells hung, swaying gently in the wind, producing a clear, ringing sound.

The sound of the bells caused a faint, golden glow to emanate from the void, dispelling some of the heavy, bloody aura.

At the temple's entrance, two black-armored warriors stood guard, their faces pale, their teeth sharp, and their eyes filled with bloodshot veins.

They were guarding the temple, whose entrance was locked, with a large, horizontal plaque hanging above the door, inscribed with the words "Cai Dian" in golden characters.

Inside the temple, two rows of crimson pillars stood tall, with iron plaques hanging from them, inscribed with characters that started with the words "Xing Qi".

For example, "Xing Qi Xing, Punish the Treacherous", "Xing Qi Mie Hun, Punish the Wicked", "Xing Qi Dian Tian Deng, Punish the Unlawful".

The temple's interior was dimly lit, with a large, dark-red fire burning in a brazier, casting flickering shadows on the walls.

At the far end of the temple, a large, black iron desk stood, with a tall, imposing figure standing behind it, its back to the door.

The figure's appearance was strange, with long arms and legs, and wide, flat hands and feet, resembling a fan.

One of its hands rested on the desk, while the other held a jade slip, its upper body glowing with a fiery red color, as if it had been burned.

On its head, a fiery red hair grew, with flames erupting from it from time to time.

Han Li would have recognized this person, as one of the five disciples who served beside Miro, the old ancestor, and also the one who had betrayed him, Qi Mozi.

"Ah, heat, heat, did you understand the efforts I made back then?" Qi Mozi sighed, putting down the jade slip, and murmuring to himself.

"It seems that your most beloved disciple is still him..." A voice echoed from a nearby brazier, where a flaming face rose up, commenting.

"Originally, I only hoped that he would stay away from this vortex, but in the end, he still got pulled in. Although I never had a good impression of him, he went to the True Words Gate this time, ultimately for my sake. Who would have thought that both of them would die in the Gray Boundary?" Qi Mozi sighed.

"What's the point of dying? It's not like you were able to retrieve the 'Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique'! Dying without achieving anything, that's just foolish..." The flaming face in the brazier retorted.

"No! After investigating, I discovered that they didn't leave empty-handed. Chi Rong sent back a message before entering the Gray Boundary, mentioning a person... a very strange person. He might be the one who gained the most from the True Words Gate's exploration, and the complete 'Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique' might be in his hands." Qi Mozi replied calmly.

"Who is that person? Where is he now?" The flaming face asked eagerly.

"That person's name is Han Li, and he has appeared in the Golden Source Immortal Domain in the past hundred years." Qi Mozi's eyes flickered, as he spoke.

"Ha ha... it seems that it's time for me to take action! Staying in this Xian Prison for too long, I've grown a bit bored. Let's make a deal, if I help you capture this person, you'll let me burn the rivers and boil the seas once? Don't worry, I've already chosen a place, a small, unremarkable location in the lower realm, it won't cause you any trouble." The flaming face rose up, hovering near the ceiling, and let out a strange, high-pitched laugh.
