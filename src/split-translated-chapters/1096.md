Qimozi spoke again, "I happened to overhear your conversation, you want to rescue the other three of the Cangshan Five Kings, but you're worried about releasing the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor. I have a way to help you rescue your brothers while dealing with the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor."

Bai Gu Yao Demon's body trembled at these words.

Tong Shi Yao Demon's expression changed, looking at Qimozi with a hint of curiosity.

"Of course, if the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor is released, I won't be able to escape with my life, so I wouldn't dare to boast about it," Qimozi said with a smile.

Tong Shi Yao Demon didn't speak, but looked at Bai Gu Yao Demon, clearly wanting him to make a decision.

"Sir, what method do you have to deal with the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor? Please explain," Bai Gu Yao Demon said with a serious expression, his eyes gleaming with sharpness.

Qimozi smiled slightly, speaking a few words in a low tone.

Bai Gu Yao Demon and Tong Shi Yao Demon's expressions changed, their eyes widening in surprise.

"It's actually like that, in that case, we have a good chance of dealing with the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor," Bai Gu Yao Demon said after a moment of consideration, nodding slowly.

Tong Shi Yao Demon also nodded thoughtfully.

"You can rest assured, since it concerns my life, I won't speak empty words," Qimozi said with a smile.

"Good, since Qimozi has a way to deal with the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor, we can join forces, but Qimozi must have some requests, please speak clearly," Bai Gu Yao Demon said firmly.

"Ha ha, since Bai Gu Yao is quick to speak, I won't beat around the bush. After rescuing your other brothers, I need your help to obtain the Suiyue God Lamp, and then help me kill Han Li," Qimozi said with a laugh, his eyes cold and devoid of any warmth.

"Kill Han Li? No problem, I've already had a grudge against him, but after killing him, his treasures will belong to us," Tong Shi Yao Demon said, his eyes lighting up.

"Han Li's immortal materials and other things can be given to you, but I want to take the cultivation manual from him, and all the written records will belong to me," Qimozi said, waving his hand.

"Alright, I only want his immortal tools, the rest can be yours," Tong Shi Yao Demon said, only caring about Han Li's green gourd and his set of lightning-attribute flying swords.

"Bai Gu Yao, what do you think?" Qimozi asked.

"Alright, I'll agree to this for my brothers, but Han Li's methods are unusual, we five brothers will only be able to assist from the sidelines, the actual fight will have to be done by you," Bai Gu Yao said, his eyes flashing.

"No problem," Qimozi said, nodding without hesitation, which slightly surprised Bai Gu Yao.

However, both parties had reached a consensus, and Bai Gu Yao didn't ask any further questions.

The main matters were settled, and both parties discussed the details, quickly coming to an agreement, and then set off immediately.

The three figures disappeared into the distance, and soon, three more figures appeared near a mountain wall, namely Qu Lin, Li Qi Ma, and the middle-aged man in blue robes.

"Unexpectedly, the new Heavenly Prison's master has also arrived, the situation is becoming more complicated," the middle-aged man in blue robes muttered.

"Qimozi, although he's the Heavenly Prison's master, his goal isn't to reinforce the seal, but to steal the Tai Sui God Lamp. His appearance might be beneficial to us," Qu Lin said, her eyes flashing with a golden light.

"It's not necessarily the case, Qimozi's appearance has increased the chances of the seal breaking, but his cultivation is deep, and he's already reached the Great Luo Realm, and he's cultivating the time law, not to mention Fox Three, even we three aren't his match, if he takes action to steal our life-bound treasures, Fox Three and the others might not be able to stop him... and our life-bound treasures are linked to the Tai Sui God Lamp, if we get close to it, our treasures will be attacked by the Tai Sui flames, so we can only rely on Fox Three and Han Li to take our treasures, if they fail, and our treasures fall into Qimozi's hands, we'll be doomed to serve him for eternity," the middle-aged man in blue robes said, shaking his head.

Qu Lin and Li Qi Ma hadn't thought of it that deeply, and after hearing the middle-aged man's analysis, they realized the severity of the situation, their expressions changing.

"What do you think we should do, Brother Liu? Should we take action to stop Qimozi before he reaches the Tai Sui Temple, and give Han Li and the others some time?" Qu Lin asked urgently.

"If Qimozi hadn't allied with Bai Gu Yao and Tong Shi Yao, we three might have had a chance to stop him, but now it's too late," the middle-aged man in blue robes sighed.

Qu Lin and Li Qi Ma's expressions turned solemn.

"Is there really no way?" Li Qi Ma asked.

"There is a way, but it involves taking some risks," the middle-aged man in blue robes said, taking out a small, human-sized doll.

The doll looked like a woman, with a beautiful face, wearing a flowing long dress, her eyes shining with a soft light, and her body occasionally twitching, as if trying to escape from the middle-aged man's hand, like a living creature.

The doll's body was half-white and half-black, with the white half having a gentle expression, and the black half having a cold and sinister look, with a hint of malevolence in her eyes, making one feel a chill.
Liqima saw the girl puppet, and his face slightly changed, then immediately returned to normal, as if he had seen this object before.

"This is..." Qu Lin was seeing this object for the first time, and his face showed surprise.

"This is a puppet I made using special materials, called 'Good and Evil Two Hearts'. If we want to retrieve our original life cards, this is the only way," said the middle-aged man in the blue robe, looking at the puppet with a complex expression in his eyes, before speaking seriously.

"How do we do it?" Qu Lin's spirit was shaken, and he immediately asked.

The middle-aged man in the blue robe waved his hand, opening a gray-white barrier that surrounded the three of them.

A moment later, the gray-white barrier flashed and disappeared, and the three of them flew out, heading in the same direction.

...

Han Li and the others flew forward, but because their divine sense couldn't probe too far, they didn't dare to fly too fast.

After a while, the group had traveled for over an hour, and suddenly stopped, their eyes shining as they looked forward.

In front of them, on a relatively flat area of a mountain peak, there was a white jade plaza, over a hundred acres in size. The ground was covered with long, white jade stones, and white mist rose from the stones, forming a shallow cloud sea on the plaza, which looked beautiful and magnificent, like a scene in the clouds.

Around the white jade plaza, tall trees were planted, with leaves and trunks that were all white, emitting a soft, white glow, looking incredibly beautiful.

After searching the plaza, the group confirmed that there were no traps or restrictions, and they landed on the plaza. However, they didn't go to admire the scenery or the white trees, but instead gathered at the front of the plaza.

There were three small stairways leading out of the plaza, each extending in a different direction.

Next to each stairway stood a white jade stone tablet, with the names "Fire Elemental Palace", "Dry Earth Temple", and "Wood Spirit Mausoleum" written on them.

After experiencing what had happened before, the group immediately understood what these places were.

Fox Three, Jiao Three, and the others' eyes lit up, each looking at one of the stairways, with a eager-to-try expression.

Just then, three beams of light flew in, landing on the three stairways, blocking their path. They were Wen Zhong, Lei Yu Ce, and Su Qian Xi.

"Now that two of the array eyes have been broken, if the other three are also broken, the Black Sky Demon God will definitely appear. At that time, we will all die without a burial place. I have spoken my piece, and you must be careful!" Lei Yu Ce said, his voice serious.

But before he finished speaking, Fox Three and Jiao Three had already flown up, heading towards the middle stairway, which led to the Dry Earth Temple, as if they hadn't heard Lei Yu Ce's words.

"Two friends, please stop, or else I will have to offend you!" Lei Yu Ce said, his voice stern, as he raised his hand.

Swish!

Dozens of golden flying swords flew out of his sleeve, blocking Fox Three and Jiao Three.

Han Li saw this, and his pupils slightly contracted.

These flying swords were over 60 in number, each emitting a strong golden law aura, and they were all at the level of 8th-grade spirit tools. A few of the flying swords emitted an especially bright golden light, reaching the level of 7th-grade spirit tools.

The dozens of powerful sword auras converged, causing the air within a hundred yards to vibrate violently, making a humming sound like a drumbeat.

Fox Three and Jiao Three didn't pay attention to the flying swords, and didn't stop their movement.

Lei Yu Ce's face turned red with anger, and he clenched his fist, making a sword seal.

The 60-odd flying swords suddenly increased in brightness, spinning around each other, forming a golden sword array. This was the same sword array he had used before, the Heaven-Piercing Sword Array.

But before the sword array could fully form, a dazzling, dark red light burst out of Jiao Three's body, engulfing the golden sword array.

The golden sword array's light suddenly stopped, and then began to dissipate rapidly, as if it was about to collapse.

At the same time, Fox Three's palm flashed with a blood light, and the Celestial Fox Blood Knife appeared in his hand, flying out in a swift slash.

"Snap!" A sound like a crack of thunder echoed through the air.

A dazzling, blood-red light burst out, instantly filling the air, making it seem like all colors had disappeared, leaving only this sticky, red light.

...
