Han Li let out a low shout, and his body radiated a five-colored glow. He flipped and rolled on the spot, and a loud, clear cry echoed out.

A massive, hundred-zhang-long five-colored phoenix emerged, which was Han Li's Tian Feng transformation. It flapped its wings and flew forward, moving with great care.

Han Li wasn't concerned about the void turbulence, but the spatial fragments were extremely sharp and even the Great Luo existence was wary of them.

Han Li had just fought a battle with Qi Mozi, and his internal time law power had been depleted. He didn't dare to make a hard collision, so he activated his Tian Feng to control the spatial divine ability, carefully avoiding the spatial fragments.

At this moment, a loud rumbling sound came from behind, and the golden light halo swept forward once again.

Han Li's heart was shocked, and his body suddenly radiated a surge of black light. The Tian Feng transformation was engulfed by the endless black light, transforming into a three-headed, six-armed Tian Sha giant.

The three heads were no longer true dragons, giant apes, or other powerful true spirits, but had transformed into a Qing Luan, a Lei Peng, and a Tian Feng.

Han Li's body moved, and his surface radiated a cyan airflow, silver lightning, and five-colored light. The three different spirit lights simultaneously erupted from his body, shooting towards the rear.

With a swift movement, the giant transformed into a phantom and flew forward, its speed shocking and exceeding that of Li Qi's full-speed flight.

Han Li could only desperately avoid the spatial fragments in front of him, but he was still hit by some of them.

The sound of explosions echoed out, and blood splattered from his body.

Fortunately, the giant's body was extremely sturdy, and the True Extreme membrane protected him. Han Li didn't suffer too much damage.

He fled desperately, managing to create some distance between himself and the golden light halo, allowing him to breathe a sigh of relief.

The golden light halo rolled forward, chasing after him, but its speed began to slow down, seemingly exhausting its power.

Han Li saw this and his face lit up with joy.

But at this moment, a muffled, earth-shaking sound came from behind!

The golden light halo suddenly burst open, transforming into countless golden light waves that surged forward, their speed exceeding that of before.

Han Li was instantly caught up in the golden light waves, and his heart was filled with shock.

He activated the Tian Sha Zhen Yu Gong, increasing the True Extreme membrane's thickness, and simultaneously released over a dozen defensive immortal artifacts that transformed into layers of light to protect his body.

But the next moment, Han Li realized he had overreacted, as the golden light waves didn't have much destructive power. They simply pushed him forward, and the scenery in front of him became blurry.

The spatial fragments around him were also pushed forward, so they didn't cause much harm to Han Li.

The golden light waves pushed him forward for a distance before quickly dissipating.

Han Li's body stabilized, and he let out a sigh of relief.

He looked forward, and a hint of joy flashed across his face. The three-colored spirit lights on his body flashed, and he was about to shoot forward like an arrow.

But he hesitated, his gaze sweeping towards a nearby location, and after a moment's hesitation, he flew forward.

A few breaths later, Han Li arrived at a location with void turbulence.

In the midst of the void turbulence, a blue figure struggled, and it was none other than Lan Yan.

Her body was covered in injuries, and her left arm had been severed at the shoulder. Her hair was disheveled, and her face was pale, looking extremely pitiful.

Moreover, Lan Yan's protective spirit light had grown extremely dim, seemingly having exhausted her immortal energy. She could barely move forward, only able to weakly resist the void turbulence's impact.

At this moment, the void turbulence in front of her fluctuated, and a door-sized spatial fragment shot out, flying towards Lan Yan.

Lan Yan's face changed, and her body's blue light faintly lit up as she tried to dodge to the side.

However, her current state was extremely poor, and despite her best efforts, she only managed to move slightly to the side, still within the spatial fragment's attack range.

Just as Lan Yan was about to be struck by the spatial fragment, a black light flashed, and Lan Yan's figure suddenly disappeared.

The spatial fragment flew past, striking nothing.

A few hundred zhang away, a black figure emerged, and it was Han Li's giant transformation, holding Lan Yan in one hand.

"Are you Fellow Daoist Han?" Lan Yan looked at Han Li with a shocked expression, her voice filled with hesitation.

Han Li nodded calmly, his other hand forming a seal as he released a green light that merged into Lan Yan's body.

Lan Yan's body suddenly radiated a green glow, and her injuries began to heal rapidly. Her protective spirit light also brightened.

Her face relaxed, and she flew out of Han Li's hand, taking out a medicinal pill and ingesting it. Her pale face regained some color.

"Thank you, Fellow Daoist Han, for saving my life," Lan Yan said with a complex expression.

Han Li replied calmly, "It was just a small act of kindness. Since you've recovered somewhat, you should continue on your own from here."

Han Li wasn't a heartless person, and he had some admiration for Lan Yan. Seeing her on the verge of collapse, he had helped her.

Moreover, Han Li had been influenced by the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor's heart magic, causing him to do some dark deeds. He was still wary of his own heart, and it was better to act with a clear conscience.

Han Li continued to fly forward, and Lan Yan watched him go, a hint of gratitude in her eyes.
Han Li wouldn't let Lan Yan follow him, but he had already helped him, which was enough.

Lan Yan looked in the direction Han Li had flown, gritted his teeth, and a blue glow burst forth from his body, shattering the surrounding chaotic void and propelling him forward.

Han Li flew swiftly, covering a great distance in a short time, and soon arrived at a region ahead.

The chaotic void was incredibly vast here, with an abundance of spatial fragments scattered throughout. A massive white scar, dozens of miles long, hung suspended in the air, and the spatial fragments were flying out from it. Through the scar, one could vaguely see the outside landscape.

Han Li's heart leapt with joy, and he formed a hand seal, causing his body to be enveloped in a dark, ink-like glow. The dark energy churned violently, accompanied by a series of deafening roars and the sound of bones cracking, but it soon subsided, and the dark energy re-entered his body, revealing his transformed form.

Han Li's massive demon form had transformed once more, with three heads that had become a true dragon, a giant ape, and a Kun Peng. His body was now even more robust and majestic, and his previous injuries had completely healed.

At the same time, over 900 dark, glowing apertures burst forth from his body, shining in harmony with the dark energy.

A massive energy wave erupted from his body, causing the surrounding chaotic void to violently fluctuate, and clearing out a large area.

The giant demon didn't immediately fly towards the white scar, as the spatial fragments nearby were too numerous. Instead, his body was enveloped in a dark glow, and six fists burst forth with intense black energy, striking the white scar with countless fist silhouettes.

The sound of explosions echoed through the air!

Each fist silhouette struck a spatial fragment, causing it to shatter and release a massive, rolling black glow, accompanied by a deafening roar.

The spatial fragments were instantly shaken, and they flew out in all directions.

Han Li's eyes widened with excitement as he witnessed this scene.

Having seen the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor's exquisite control over dark energy, he began to experiment with his own control, using the small techniques he had learned from the Golden Spirit Domain's self-destruction. It seemed to be effective.

Han Li flew forward slowly, his six fists continuously striking out.

The spatial fragments near the white scar were constantly being shaken, and he soon arrived at the scar.

Han Li's six fists burst forth with black energy once more, and he combined them into a single, massive fist silhouette that struck the white scar.

A deafening roar echoed through the air!

The massive fist silhouette shattered, releasing a gigantic black glow that rolled out, clearing out the surrounding spatial fragments.

The giant demon then let out a mighty roar, and his six fists struck the white scar once more.

Another deafening roar echoed through the air!

The white scar violently shook, and the area where the fists struck shattered, revealing a massive hole.

Han Li's face lit up with joy, and he formed a hand seal, causing his body to shrink back to its normal size. He then flew out of the hole.

Outside the hole was a vast, misty valley, with a grey, ominous sky. This was the location of the Years Tower.

The tower stood tall, but its top layer had been destroyed, and a chaotic, swirling vortex had formed, like a tornado.

The cultivators from the various factions had vanished, and only a few who had escaped were lingering nearby, observing the scene from a distance, seemingly fearful of the tower's current state.

Han Li took in the surroundings, his heart slightly at ease.

But then, his brow suddenly furrowed, and he turned to look behind him.

A massive spatial hole was floating in the air, with countless chaotic voids swirling within. A blue figure burst forth from the hole, landing near Han Li. It was Lan Yan.

Her body was covered in new injuries, and her blue glow had dimmed significantly. She panted heavily, exhausted.

She took out two blue talismans, formed a hand seal, and activated them, causing the talismans to fuse into her body. Her panting stopped, and her complexion improved.

"I didn't have time to thank you earlier, but I must thank you, Han Daoist, for not holding a grudge and saving me. I will definitely repay this debt in the future," Lan Yan said, her face serious.

"It's nothing, Lan Daoist. Don't worry about it," Han Li replied, his voice calm.

Lan Yan shook her head, "It may be nothing to you, but it's a great debt to me."

Han Li didn't say anything else, and instead, he took out a medicinal pill and swallowed it, looking around for the figures of Jiao San and others.

Lan Yan gazed at Han Li deeply, then flew away, landing in the distance, and closed her eyes to meditate.

Han Li didn't pay attention to Lan Yan, his divine sense spreading out to search for the figures of Jiao San and others, his brow furrowed in concern.

But he couldn't find any traces of them.
