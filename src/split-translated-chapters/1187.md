"What does the Heavenly Court want to use our abilities for, and what do they want to predict?" Xiao Bai frowned and asked.

"Gu or Jin seems to have realized something about the abnormal Heavenly Dao, and wants to use my power to help him see his own future... But this behavior is against the Heavenly Dao, and I won't help him. Besides, I've never liked the Heavenly Court's way of doing things, so I won't assist them... In the future, you'll inherit this power too, but be careful, because the price is too high." Mo Yu pondered for a moment before speaking slowly.

"Father, why did only Yuan Gang Uncle take action in the entire Barbarian Domain? White Ze isn't also your close friend, so why didn't he lend a hand?" Xiao Bai nodded, and after a moment of silence, continued asking.

"Don't blame him, I didn't let him take action. If other True Spirit Kings were also involved, it would have sparked a war between the Barbarian Domain and the Immortal Realm. At that time, it wouldn't just be a matter of a few mountains and rivers being destroyed, but half of the Immortal Realm and the Barbarian Domain would be drenched in blood. We've finally brought peace to the Barbarian Domain, and I won't let it be ruined." Mo Yu sighed and spoke.

Xiao Bai fell silent once again upon hearing this.

"I'm glad I can tell you all this in person. The name Xiao Bai is quite good, so from now on, you can call yourself Mo Xiao Bai..." Mo Yu's face showed a hint of a smile as he spoke slowly.

"Uh, I'm still me, still Xiao Bai..."

...

Time passed, and over a hundred years went by.

In the courtyard of the Asura Blood Gate, the eight stone pillars emitted a faint glow, and the bloody aura in the surrounding void also became much weaker.

Several people were scattered in the center of the courtyard, forming small groups and whispering to each other. Their expressions were different, and their faces showed varying emotions.

The largest group consisted of the Heavenly Fox Tribe, including Liu Qing, Huo San, and Liu Le'er, who stood alongside Yuan Shan Bai and Pi Xi Xiao Bai. Liu Zi and Shan Shi were nowhere to be seen.

At this moment, Xiao Bai had transformed from his previous white dog appearance and had become a young boy with rosy lips and white teeth, looking quite handsome. On his forehead, a golden vertical line had appeared, resembling a closed vertical eye.

Yuan Shan Bai, on the other hand, had undergone a drastic change, with his simian features becoming less pronounced. His two protruding beast teeth had transformed into tiger teeth, making him look even more adorable.

Liu Le'er's transformation was the most striking, with a golden flower-like pattern appearing on her forehead. Her body had become more slender and elegant, exuding an aura that was not seductive but captivating.

Nearby, Qing Tian and the young master of the Zhu Wu Tribe stood together, their bodies becoming more robust and tall.

Qing Tian's sharp horns had disappeared, and his appearance had become more similar to that of a True Spirit King, Zhu Yan.

The young master of the Zhu Wu Tribe had fully transformed into a human, but his aura had increased significantly, making him look more powerful.

These individuals, who had inherited the True Spirit Kings' bloodline, would experience a rapid increase in power in the short term. However, the greater benefit was that their future path would be smoother, and their cultivation speed would surpass that of others.

The last group consisted of only Li Qi Ma, who leaned against a stone pillar, gazing at the giant gate in the distance.

"Why hasn't he come out yet?" he thought to himself.

"Time is almost up, and the Asura Blood Gate is about to close. I think Han Li is probably dead inside." Qing Tian spoke with a smile, addressing the young master of the Zhu Wu Tribe.

"Hehe, that human is arrogant, thinking he can challenge the True Spirit Kings. He's just a joke, and his death is well-deserved." The young master of the Zhu Wu Tribe chuckled, intentionally provoking Xiao Bai.

"You're talking nonsense, he won't die!" Xiao Bai retorted angrily.

"We'll see about that. In half an hour, the three giant gates will disappear, and the Asura Blood Gate will close. By then, he'll be dead, haha..." Qing Tian sneered, taking pleasure in Han Li's misfortune.

"It's a pity, really..." The young master of the Zhu Wu Tribe smiled, but his words were laced with regret.

After all, they had just inherited the True Spirit Kings' bloodline and had experienced a significant increase in power. They had wanted to use this opportunity to humiliate Han Li and avenge their past grievances. But now, with Han Li's impending death, they would no longer have the chance.

Xiao Bai's anger surged, and he was about to charge at Qing Tian and the young master of the Zhu Wu Tribe.

Yuan Shan Bai, who had recently become friends with Xiao Bai, followed closely behind, his brow furrowed in concern.

"Let them talk, when Brother Han Li comes out, they'll know how painful it is to have their faces slapped." Liu Le'er intervened, calmly speaking.

She was the only one who firmly believed that Han Li would return safely.

The reason was that during their time in the lower realm, Han Li had given her the greatest sense of security. She would always believe in him from the bottom of her heart.

This was a conviction that, no matter how low the probability, she would always hold onto.

Liu Qing sighed silently, watching the scene unfold.

After this series of events, his opinion of Han Li had completely changed. Although he still didn't think Han Li could compare to Liu Le'er, he was willing to consider him a powerful ally of the Heavenly Fox Tribe.

But all of this was predicated on Han Li being able to walk out of the gate alive. Unfortunately, entering the eight True Spirit Kings' inheritance was not an easy task.

Huo San remained silent, his face expressionless, but his heart was filled with concern.
Time flowed by, bit by bit, and although it had only been half an hour, the crowd felt it was an eternity. As the final moment approached, Liu Le'er wished time would slow down even more.

The three crimson copper gates in front of the golden flames had long since gone out, but the doors still refused to open.

"Haha, are you still waiting? He's definitely dead..." Qing Dian laughed loudly.

"Let's go, no need to wait anymore." Zhu Wu tribe's young master shouted, turning to leave.

In his opinion, the excitement here was over, and that guy who made him jealous was clearly finished.

However, just as he turned around, a loud creaking sound came from behind, and the middle gate of the crimson copper gates suddenly opened.

Zhu Wu's young master's body stiffened, and he turned his head back to look. He saw a blood-red mist mixed with the aura of the primordial chaos pouring out of the gate, and a tall figure emerged from within.

The figure's height was almost equal to the gate, and its body was covered in scales that shone with a reddish-black light. Six massive arms propped up the heavy gate, and three giant heads grew from its shoulders.

The two heads on the sides were like an ape and a tiger, which were the heads of Zhu Yan and Chu Mu. The head in the middle was like a true dragon, but slightly different, and it was the head of a Black Tortoise.

This person was none other than Han Li.

At this moment, his Heaven-Sealing Prison Gates technique had reached its peak, and he had fully mastered the three-headed, six-armed form. The aura emanating from his body was incredibly powerful, and it was terrifying.

Right now, he was even more like a Primordial Spirit than the surrounding barbaric spirits.

"How is this possible..." Qing Dian muttered to himself.

Zhu Wu's young master was left speechless, his eyes wide with shock.

Their previous thoughts of using their inherited bloodline to overpower Han Li had vanished in an instant.

"Is this really a human?" Liu Qing exclaimed.

Li Chi Ma's eyes narrowed, and he didn't say a word, but his heart was shocked to the core.

"Brother..." Liu Le'er called out excitedly.

Xiao Bai and Yuan Shan Bai rushed forward, one after the other.

Han Li's body quickly shrunk back to its normal size, and the reddish-black light on his upper body began to fade. The numerous acupoints on his body, which had been opened up, emitted a powerful aura.

"This... this is over a thousand acupoints! His physical body has been strengthened to such an extent?" Huo San exclaimed, his eyes wide with amazement.

After a dozen breaths, the light on Han Li's body finally faded, and the aura began to recede. Everything returned to normal.

Han Li let out a soft sigh and pulled out a blue robe to put on.

As he walked out, he suddenly stopped and looked back at the third gate.

When he looked at it, the scene around him changed instantly, and he felt as though he had entered a different barbaric world. He didn't see any barbaric beasts, but he sensed a pure and untainted aura.

It was the true aura of the barbaric world, an aura that was unbound and without rules. It was as though the world had returned to its primordial state.

Before he could investigate further, a terrifying force suddenly emerged from the gate, as though it would devour him and tear him apart.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat, and he quickly looked away, his forehead covered in cold sweat.

When he looked back at the crowd, he realized that time had seemed to stand still, and no one had noticed anything.

Han Li's heart was filled with shock, and he didn't dare look at the third gate again. He quickly walked towards the crowd.

"What took you so long?" Xiao Bai complained.

"Sorry, I made you worry." Han Li smiled and said.

As soon as he finished speaking, the entire space began to shake violently, and the three crimson copper gates behind him began to sink into the ground, disappearing from sight.

The square with the eight stone pillars began to fade away, disappearing bit by bit.

"Let's go, we'll talk later." Han Li said, grabbing Xiao Bai and Yuan Shan Bai, and rushing towards the Shura Blood Gate.
