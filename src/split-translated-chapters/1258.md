Han Li's eyes widened as he saw the old man's sudden movement. Before he could even finish speaking, the old man had already reached out and grabbed at his chest.

A golden thread appeared out of thin air, wrapping around Han Li's chest and pulling out the small, emerald-green bottle that he had been keeping hidden. The bottle was then pulled into the old man's hand.

Han Li's body trembled, and his mind was shaken to its core.

Besides himself, no one knew what the bottle meant to him.

From his first encounter with the Seven Mysteries Gate, to his subsequent adventures across the Three Realms, his journey as a cultivator had been marked by the bottle's presence. It could be said that without the bottle, there would be no Han Li today. Even back then, he might not have been able to escape the clutches of the infamous Mo Daifu.

But now, facing the old man, Han Li felt like a child standing before a mountain, unable to even muster the slightest resistance.

Although he had cultivated both body and spirit, and had grasped the Time Laws, allowing him to hold his own against opponents a small realm above him, he was no match for the old man, who was a full major realm above him. The old man was a Dao Ancestor, a top-tier expert in the True Immortal Realm, and even the powerful figures in the Heavenly Court would have to show him deference.

All Han Li could do was stare at the old man, and the small bottle in his hand.

The old man's face was as calm as a still pond, his hand grasping the small bottle as he gently stroked the leaf patterns on its surface. It was as if he had been reunited with a long-lost treasured item, and was reluctant to let it go.

After a moment, the old man's expression changed, but only for an instant before returning to normal.

Han Li noticed the subtle change in the old man's expression, and his heart stirred with a faint sense of unease. He wondered if the old man was communicating with the bottle spirit within the bottle.

After another moment, the old man sighed and looked at Han Li once more.

With a mere flick of his wrist, the old man dispelled the restrictive bindings that had been holding Han Li in place.

Han Li felt a surge of relief, but he dared not move, instead watching the old man with a mixture of fear and trepidation.

But then, the old man did something that left Han Li stunned.

He raised his hand, and with a gentle toss, returned the small bottle to Han Li.

Han Li was taken aback, and his instincts kicked in as he caught the bottle. He looked at the old man with a mixture of confusion and suspicion.

"This bottle will only become more troublesome in the future," the old man said, his voice calm and measured. "Perhaps losing it in the past was not a misfortune, and gaining it back today is not a blessing. We of the Nine Yuan Observatory cannot accept this treasure, so if you wish to keep it, then keep it..."

Han Li's face contorted in confusion, but he did not hesitate, instead carefully putting the bottle back around his neck and hiding it beneath his robes.

Han Li was left feeling bewildered, his mind reeling with questions. But he knew better than to ask, and instead said, "From your words, I take it that you do not intend to kill me?"

"Today, you may leave the Nine Yuan Observatory unharmed, and for a time, you will not be pursued by our cultivators. However, you are still a remnant of the Wheel of Reincarnation, and a name on the Heavenly Court's list of those to be executed. If you set foot in the Golden Source Realm again, you will be walking into a death trap," the old man said, his eyes glinting with a hint of warning.

Han Li knew that he should not press the issue, but he couldn't help asking, "May I ask, why are you showing me mercy?"

The old man's expression turned wistful, and he said, "Some things are destined by the workings of fate, and even the passage of time cannot change them. Since the Heavenly Dao has brought you before me, it is only fitting that I repay the debt of gratitude that I owe you, and settle this matter once and for all."

Han Li's confusion deepened, and he asked, "You mean to say that you owe me a debt of gratitude?"

As far as Han Li knew, he had no prior connection with the old man, and their realms were as different as heaven and earth. How could he possibly have done something to earn the old man's gratitude?

"You are not yet at a level where you can understand the workings of fate," the old man said, his voice tinged with a hint of sadness. "Suffice it to say that I have repaid the debt, and the connection between us has been severed."

Han Li's mind was reeling, but he asked, "You mean to say that in a past life, someone did something to earn your gratitude, and now that person's soul has reincarnated into me?"

The old man's expression turned strange, and he seemed taken aback by Han Li's question.

"Release the Devouring Gold Immortal," he said, his voice abrupt. "I have something to say to her."

Han Li was taken aback by the sudden change in topic, but he hesitated for only a moment before complying with the old man's request.

After all, the old man had promised not to harm him, and it was unlikely that he would harm the Devouring Gold Immortal either. Han Li decided to play along and see what the old man had in mind.
A golden light burst forth, and a slender, golden-haired girl suddenly appeared beside Han Li.

"Uncle, what's going on up ahead... Ah, old man, how did you...?" she exclaimed, her eyes flashing with surprise.

"It's been a while, and you've grown so much," the old man said with a smile, seemingly also surprised.

"Uncle, this is the old man I was telling you about, the one who's been kind to me," Jintong said, looking at Han Li with a smile.

"Jintong, don't be rude, he's the elder of the Ninth Heaven Sect," Han Li hastily reminded him, fearing that Jintong's words might stir up trouble.

"Jintong, I think we have a good affinity, and I'm willing to break the rules to take you in as a disciple, a closed-door disciple, are you willing to stay at the Ninth Heaven Sect?" the old man said, seemingly unconcerned.

Han Li's expression changed once again as he listened to the old man's words, and he realized what the old man's intention was.

Just as he was about to warn Jintong, he heard her say nonchalantly:

"No! I've just escaped from that broken place, Ghost Valley, and I don't plan on staying in this broken place again."

"This time it's different, it's not being a prisoner, but being my closed-door disciple, with a generation and rank equal to Chunjun, what do you think?" the old man asked again, his expression unchanged.

Han Li's eyes widened as he listened to the old man's words, and he looked at Jintong with a hesitant gaze.

"I still won't stay, although I think you're all right, and we get along well, but I already have a master, and I don't plan on following anyone else," Jintong said without hesitation.

"Very well, I won't force you. This golden pellet is a gift, a token of my appreciation," the old man said, taking out a golden pellet the size of a dragon's eye and tossing it to Jintong.

"Thank you, you're a good person, I won't be polite," Jintong said with a smile, accepting the pellet.

Han Li felt a sense of speechlessness as he listened to Jintong's words, wondering who else in the True Immortal Realm would dare to speak to the elder of the Ninth Heaven Sect in such a manner. If the master of the Hundred Refinement Mountain knew, he would probably be furious.

"Alright, you can leave now," the old man said with a smile, glancing at Han Li before waving his hand.

A metal disk flew out and landed on the ground, emitting a dazzling silver light.

As the light faded, a spatial ripple spread out, and a silver light gate appeared above the disk.

Beyond the gate lay a vast, blue sea.

"Let's go," Han Li said, beckoning Jintong to follow him as he walked towards the gate.

As they reached the entrance, Han Li felt a sudden jolt, and his mind flashed back to a distant memory. He turned back to ask:

"Senior, may I ask, what is your name?"

"My name? It's been a long time since anyone has called me that... My name is Li Yuanjiu," the old man replied after a moment of hesitation.

Han Li felt as though he had been struck by lightning, and his body froze in place.

But before he could react, the old man waved his sleeve, and a whirlwind swept Han Li and Jintong into the gate.

As they emerged on the other side, Han Li heard the old man's warning:

"Leave quickly, and don't set foot in the Ninth Heaven Sect's territory again. Take care of yourself."

The silver light gate closed behind them, and Han Li found himself standing on the blue sea.

"Uncle, what now? Where do we go?" Jintong asked, looking around.

But Han Li didn't respond, still in a daze. Jintong turned to him, concerned, and saw that Han Li was still in a state of shock.

In reality, Han Li's mind was filled with the name "Li Yuanjiu".

He remembered that, when he had accidentally entered the body of an old Daoist named Lingyunzi, he had met a disciple named Li Yuanjiu. Han Li had even transmitted the "Brahma True Demon Technique" and the "Supporting Heaven Demon Technique" to him.

Han Li wondered if Li Yuanjiu's mention of "karmic debt" was related to this. But then he thought it unlikely, as Li Yuanjiu's cultivation level at the time wouldn't have allowed him to discover the soul transfer.

Just then, Han Li recalled that Li Yuanjiu had mentioned two words: "wheel of reincarnation".
