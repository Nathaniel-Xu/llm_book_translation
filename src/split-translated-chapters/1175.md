Time trickled by, and soon the sun had reached its peak.

The dark red barrier that enveloped the mountain peak had softened the sunlight, but the crowd that had been watching from below had already begun to feel a sense of despair.

Above them, only a hundred dark red stone steps remained, and ascending them would bring them to the summit. However, these steps seemed to have become an insurmountable barrier, blocking the path for almost everyone.

Just then, a cry of despair echoed from the mountain path.

A Heaven Fox tribe member, who had been resting for a while, finally gathered the courage to charge up the first step.

As soon as his foot landed on the step, a massive force swept in from all directions, instantly crushing him, and a series of cracking sounds echoed from his body, as if his bones were being shattered.

Liu Qing saw this and furrowed her brow, taking a step forward into the red mountain path. She grasped the Heaven Fox tribe member and pulled him back with all her might.

"The path ahead is not for anyone to tread," Liu Qing said, holding the unconscious Heaven Fox tribe member. "For those with weak bloodline powers, this is the end of the road."

The crowd's faces turned pale as they listened to her words.

They knew that if they could reach the summit, they would be rewarded with a great opportunity. However, the summit was now within sight, yet seemed so far away.

Han Li, accompanied by Xiao Bai, finally arrived at the hundred-step stone staircase and stopped.

As he reached this point, he felt as though a massive stone was pressing down on his chest, making it hard to breathe. His true spirit bloodline was stirring, helping him to alleviate the pressure.

When he saw Xiao Bai, who was drenched and trembling like a dead dog, he didn't feel any mockery, but rather a sense of admiration.

Soon, the Mountain Ape tribe arrived, but only a few members remained, including the elderly tribe leader and Xiao Bai.

As they approached, they stopped and looked at Xiao Bai, who was still trembling on the ground. Yuan Shanbai smiled and gave Xiao Bai a thumbs-up, expressing his admiration.

Xiao Bai struggled to stand up, shaking off the fatigue.

Liu Qing turned around and looked at the group, her eyes scanning Han Li's face with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.

Han Li was used to this kind of attention.

He even noticed that the elderly Mountain Ape tribe leader was secretly glancing at him, and Han Li couldn't help but feel a sense of wry amusement.

At the same time, Han Li wondered why he was able to withstand the pressure, and whether it was related to the Mountain Ape's bloodline within him.

After all, this was one of the eight ancient True Spirit Kings.

Just then, the Heaven Fox tribe began to move forward, but only seven members, including Liu Qing and Liu Le'er, continued on, while the rest sat down at the base of the stairs.

As the seven members stepped onto the final hundred steps, a brilliant white light burst forth from their bodies, and a series of thick, white fox tails extended from their backs. The light was most intense around Liu Le'er, who had the fewest tails, only six, but her body shone with the brightest light.

From Han Li's observations, he noticed that Liu Le'er's aura was the most pure and thick, even surpassing Liu Qing's.

Seeing that Liu Le'er was unharmed despite the intense pressure, Han Li felt a sense of relief.

"Let's go," Han Li said to Xiao Bai.

Xiao Bai struggled to stand up, his tongue lolling out of his mouth, and nodded.

They turned around and looked at the two Mountain Ape tribe members, who were still resting, and stepped onto the final hundred steps.

Han Li had prepared himself for this, but when his foot landed on the step, he still felt an overwhelming force, causing him to stumble.

He propped himself up with his hands and pressed his body against the stairs, taking a long time to recover.

Xiao Bai, on the other hand, was in a similar state, his four limbs trembling as he struggled to stand up, his mouth emitting a series of muffled whimpers.

Han Li turned to Xiao Bai and forced a smile, his body glowing with a dark light as he transformed into a three-headed, six-armed demon.

With his six arms, he supported Xiao Bai and shielded him from the pressure, slowly crawling up the stairs like a spider.
Xiao Bai was under Han Li's protection, and although he was still subjected to the crushing pressure of the surrounding space, he finally had a chance to catch his breath. He struggled to his feet and began to climb up, one step at a time.

After climbing up a dozen or so levels, Xiao Bai felt that he had adapted somewhat, and he used his spiritual connection to Han Li to try to climb on his own.

Han Li hesitated for a moment before deciding to respect Xiao Bai's opinion, and he moved to the side to let Xiao Bai continue climbing.

Without Han Li's protection, the pressure from above bore down on Xiao Bai once again, causing his limbs to tremble and almost making him collapse.

However, after struggling for a moment, Xiao Bai finally managed to steady himself and began to climb up again.

As he climbed higher, the pressure from the space grew exponentially, and even Han Li felt like he was about to collapse. Xiao Bai's situation was even more dire.

Just as Xiao Bai was about to reach the top of the stairs, his mouth and nose began to bleed, and he stumbled and fell.

Han Li watched in concern as Xiao Bai's eyes turned glassy, and he felt a surge of anxiety.

Just then, a sudden change occurred!

A Tian Huo tribe member who was just one step away from the top of the stairs suddenly collapsed under the pressure, falling backwards and tumbling down the stairs towards Xiao Bai.

The Tian Huo tribe member's body was not large, but the force of the fall was immense, and it was like a mountain peak crashing down on Xiao Bai.

Xiao Bai's strength was already at its limit, and he was unable to dodge the falling body. He felt like he was going to collapse under the pressure.

In the nick of time, a dark shadow flashed in front of him, and the falling body seemed to collide with something before rolling away.

At the same time, Han Li's voice echoed in Xiao Bai's ear: "Just a little further, hold on!"

Xiao Bai's eyes snapped open, and he looked around, wondering where Han Li had gone.

When he turned to look back, he saw Han Li tumbling down the stairs with the Tian Huo tribe member.

Xiao Bai's heart swelled with gratitude, and he gritted his teeth, letting out a fierce roar.

At the same time, his eyes flashed with a golden light, and his body seemed to gain a surge of strength.

With renewed energy, Xiao Bai climbed up the stairs, his four limbs moving in tandem as he ascended to the top.

"I made it, I made it..." Xiao Bai exclaimed, but before he could even celebrate, he felt a wave of exhaustion wash over him, and he collapsed to the ground, unconscious.

Liu Le'er, who had already reached the top, rushed over to Xiao Bai's side, but a white-robed man with a handsome face appeared, saying: "He's fine, he just temporarily activated the sealed bloodline power. He'll recover after a short rest."

Liu Le'er looked up to see that it was the True Spirit King, Bai Ze, and she was surprised.

"You go rest, I'll take care of him," Bai Ze said.

Liu Le'er hesitated for a moment before nodding and leaving.

Bai Ze picked up Xiao Bai and fed him a dark red pill, then looked down at the mountain below, a hint of a smile on his face.

"As a human, it's not easy to do what you did..."

Meanwhile, Han Li was still struggling to climb up the mountain, his six arms grasping at the stone stairs as he tried to stabilize himself.

However, he was unable to resist the pressure, and he tumbled down the stairs, his body rolling and crashing against the stone.

Just as he was about to fall again, a massive hand reached out from below and caught him, pulling him back to safety.

Han Li vomited up a mouthful of blood as he struggled to his feet, and he saw that it was the long-browed elder of the Ban Shan tribe who had saved him.

"Thank you, elder," Han Li said, bowing his head in gratitude.

The elder just smiled and nodded, then continued climbing up the mountain with a small ape by his side.

Han Li watched them go, then sat down to rest and recover. After a short while, he stood up again, looking up at the peak.

Climbing the mountain again after being injured was even more difficult than before.

Han Li closed his eyes, focusing his spiritual energy as he began to climb once more.
