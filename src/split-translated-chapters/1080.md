Han Li, a full-powered strike from a Da Luo-level Devouring Gold Immortal is not something to be taken lightly! I know you have skills, but you shouldn't be so reckless," Jiao San transmitted to Han Li.

"Han Li, he only said not to dodge or avoid, but didn't say you couldn't use magical treasures or artifacts. I can lend you the Tian Huo Blood Knife to take his punch, and it should give you an advantage," Huo San also transmitted.

"Thank you for your kindness, I have my own plan," Han Li smiled and replied.

Jiao San and Huo San heard this and exchanged puzzled glances, but didn't try to persuade him further.

"If you have any defensive robes or the like, wear as many as you can, just don't dodge or avoid. My punch won't leave any room for you," the young man sneered, showing off his white teeth.

"No need," Han Li shook his head and said.

After that, he looked at Jiao San and the others, and transmitted a warning to them to temporarily retreat.

The group heard this and quickly retreated to a distance of over ten li, watching from afar.

"What's Han Li planning? Can he really take down this Devouring Gold Immortal's full-powered strike?" Huo San wondered.

"I don't know, but based on my understanding of him, he's never one to fight a battle without confidence. Since he's already agreed, let's just wait and see," Jiao San shook his head and said.

Xiong Shan didn't say anything, but instead seemed to be the most at ease among the three. He even felt that this Da Luo-level Devouring Gold Immortal was likely to be outsmarted by Han Li.

After the group retreated, Han Li lightly beckoned with his finger, and a spherical light screen expanded outward, covering an area of over a thousand zhang.

"Time Domain... You think you can use time laws to block my attack?" the young man raised an eyebrow and said.

"You can make your move," Han Li said calmly, without responding.

After that, he took a step back and assumed a defensive stance, his internal spiritual energy surging like a flood. The "Tian Sha Zhen Yu Gong" and "Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue" had already begun to circulate.

"This is interesting..." The young man saw this and raised an eyebrow, his expression full of interest.

Just as he finished speaking, a massive golden light burst forth from his body, his clothes fluttering wildly, and his sleeves rippling with energy.

Under his feet, a series of golden light circles expanded and contracted, like ripples on a lake, spreading out for hundreds of li.

"Rustling, rustling..."

The desert sand was blown back by the force of the attack, the golden sand grains jumping and dancing like they were celebrating.

Jiao San and the others felt the force of the attack and turned pale, their eyes filled with doubt as they looked at Han Li.

Han Li was closest to the young man, and naturally felt the most intense shock. However, his face remained calm, and he only accelerated his spiritual energy circulation.

"Are you ready?" the young man asked, his eyebrow raised, as he took a step back and began to gather his energy.

Han Li didn't respond, but a massive golden light burst forth from his body.

Behind him, a golden treasure wheel emerged, its surface glowing with a brilliant light, and flew out to merge with the surrounding Time Domain. The treasure wheel flew upward, shining like a full moon, and released a gentle, soothing light that illuminated the surroundings.

Following that, a layer of golden sand grains spread across the ground, merging with the desert sand, and it was almost impossible to distinguish between the two. However, the light flowing across the sand grains caused the surrounding terrain to change, and a mountain range emerged.

Next, the Dong Yi Divine Tree sprouted, growing into a lush forest, filling the mountains and valleys.

The River of Time seemed to flow down from the heavens, transforming into a winding river that flowed through the mountains and valleys.

A golden torch scattered countless golden sparks, which flew backward into the air, like a dense starry sky, filling the night sky.

"This is..."

The young man's eyes widened in surprise at the sight.

However, he didn't understand the mysteries of the "Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue", and only felt a sense of wonder, without realizing that his own state was undergoing a strange transformation.

"Hah, what's the point of creating these bizarre illusions? They're useless against me!" the young man sneered, despite feeling that the flow of time was slowing down, and his movements were becoming more restricted.

Just as he finished speaking, the golden light surrounding him reached its peak, and his body was filled with a massive, pent-up energy.

At that moment, he took a step forward, and a massive golden fist flew out, striking toward Han Li.

"Boom boom boom..."

The air was filled with the sound of thunder, and a massive golden fist shadow flew out, seemingly unaffected by the Time Domain's restrictions, and struck toward Han Li.

However, just as the fist flew out, the young man's expression changed, and he realized that his attack was much weaker than he had anticipated.

His expression changed again, and he finally understood what was happening to him.

Han Li, who was facing him from a distance, was also not relaxed, as the Time Crystal threads he had condensed earlier had already consumed a significant amount of his energy, which made him feel a pang of pain. He quickly withdrew the various illusions created by the Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue.
The surroundings suddenly changed, and the fist that flew in was suddenly accelerated to an incredible speed, almost instantly reaching Han Li's front.

Fortunately, he had long been prepared for this, and the "Tian Sha Zhen Yu Gong" within him had also been activated to its limit, and he also punched out a fist towards the golden fist.

This punch did not use the spiritual energy that had been consumed in the past, but instead gathered the power of the stars in his body and condensed it into his fist, and with a sudden burst of energy, he struck out.

A loud "boom" echoed out.

The golden fist was almost pasted onto Han Li's fist, and his fist also burst out with a brilliant white light, like a snowstorm suddenly attacking, and like a proud sun exploding.

The golden light and white light simultaneously merged and exploded, and a chaotic whirlpool rose up, sweeping towards all directions, instantly stirring up the surrounding air into chaos.

On the ground, hundreds of chaotic air currents rolled up, stirring up yellow sand tornadoes that reached the sky, and the desert was like a demon dragon soaring through the air, making terrifying rumbling sounds.

Han Li was directly smashed into the underground golden sand by a massive force, his bones cracking and his muscles aching unbearably.

His eyes shone brightly, and with a wave of his arm, he heavily struck the ground, and his body suddenly burst out of the flowing sand, directly smashing through dozens of yellow sand tornadoes, and hovering in front of the young man.

After a moment, the commotion gradually subsided, but the entire desert was still filled with dust, and visibility was poor.

"I've received your punch, how is it?" Han Li spat out a mouthful of blood from his chest, and asked.

"How is this possible? Your spiritual domain..." The young man looked at his fist in surprise.

"Your cultivation state has temporarily retreated by several hundred million years, but it will gradually recover later." Han Li said calmly.

Although he said it lightly, the young man still felt shocked.

Indeed, when he had punched out earlier, he had discovered that his fist's power was insufficient, and it was not an illusion. At that moment, his cultivation had indeed been suppressed and retreated by a lot.

"Since you've received my punch unscathed, what I said earlier will naturally count. I won't stop you from exploring, and I can even take you to the seventh floor. And you, will take me out of the tower." The young man said.

"If you hadn't punched out earlier and directly agreed to my proposal, it would have been possible. But since you've punched out, some conditions will change." Han Li suddenly smiled, and said slowly.

"Do you mean to go back on your word?" The young man frowned.

"I won't go back on my word, but I need you to do something for me." Han Li said.

"What is it?" The young man asked, suppressing his anger.

"This time, among the people who entered the Time Tower, there is a Da Luo cultivator who is my arch-nemesis. I want you to help me deal with him. Of course, this isn't necessarily something you have to do. If he doesn't take the initiative to find me, you don't have to do it. After we leave the Time Tower, you'll be free, and you won't have to do it." Han Li said, seeing that Jiao San and the others had already arrived.

"Is that all?" The young man asked, hesitating.

"That's all." Han Li nodded, and said.

As they spoke, Jiao San and the others arrived, and looked at the scene before them with strange expressions.

Earlier, when Han Li had used the Five Elements Fantasy, they had also sensed the dense time law power, but they didn't know what had happened specifically. However, looking at the current situation, they also knew what had happened.

"By the way, there's something else I can tell you. When I was touring the various immortal realms, I saw two Tai Yi boundary cultivators who were likely of the same kind as you..."

"Where did you see them?" Han Li asked, before being interrupted by the young man.

"In the North Cold Immortal Realm and the Golden Source Immortal Realm, one was a half-grown child, and the other was a fierce woman." Han Li casually fabricated.

"If you can take me to find them, I'll protect you completely, even after we leave the Time Tower. If the person you mentioned finds you, I'll also do my best to help you kill him." The young man said, after a moment of consideration, his eyes flashing with an unusual color.

"Then it's settled." Han Li smiled.

Earlier, he had intentionally activated the connection between his soul and the Golden Child, so the young man wouldn't care about the truth of his words.

The two of them spoke on the surface, but both had their own thoughts. Han Li had the intention of taking the young man to the Golden Child to devour, and the young man also had the intention of finding the Golden Child and devouring him.

"Now, can you tell me your name?" Han Li asked, smiling.

"Qu Xian." The young man replied.

"I'm Han Li." Han Li said, with a slight bow.

"Brother Han, since we've reached an agreement, let's not delay. I'll take you to the seventh floor immediately." Qu Xian said, with some urgency.

"No rush, no rush. Let me meditate for a moment." Han Li said, waving his hand.

Qu Xian's previous punch was incredibly powerful, and Han Li had been able to block it with great difficulty. How could he not have been injured at all?

He said this, and then sat down cross-legged, taking out a pill and swallowing it, before closing his eyes to meditate.
