As the slender man gazed at Han Li, Han Li's eyes also swept over him, taking in his appearance.

The man's skin was very pale, with a head of slightly curly yellow hair tied up high, sparse and light eyebrows, and eyes that were somewhat long and narrow, with a reddish glow in the eye sockets, giving the impression that he was not in good spirits.

However, the aura emanating from his body was quite fearsome, and he was actually a late-stage Da Luo realm cultivator.

"Your 'big fish' remark, is it referring to my spirit pet or me?" the young man asked, his eyes fixed intently on Han Li, his smile not quite reaching his eyes.

His features seemed delicate, but his voice was deep and resonant.

"Whatever you think it is, that's what it is," Han Li replied, glancing up at the sky above.

Zi Ling and Shi Chuan Kong had indeed been blocked, but it was not by any sort of barrier or restriction, rather by a layer of spiritual domain light and several hundred heavenly court cultivators.

From their attire, it was clear that they were mostly monitoring and patrolling cultivators.

"Either way, there's no escaping my net," the slender man said, his eyes gleaming with amusement.

"Your display is quite impressive, may I ask your name?" Han Li asked.

"I am Shui Chang Tian, temporarily in charge of the monitoring department, and I have been ordered to capture you, Han. I don't know if you plan to surrender or if I'll have to take you into custody. To be honest, anyone who has tried to escape from my water prison has yet to regret it," the yellow-haired man said with a smile.

"Shui Chang Tian, your name is quite fitting, suitable for a water burial," Han Li laughed, his voice ringing out.

As he spoke, he waved his hand, and seventy-two bamboo swords shot out, swirling in mid-air before plummeting down towards the sea.

The swords emitted a thunderous roar, with hundreds of golden lightning bolts intersecting and gathering into a massive sword array, which seemed to be a sea of lightning.

"Boom!"

A deafening thunderclap shook the air, and countless lightning bolts as thick as water barrels descended from the sky.

The massive black whale let out a low, mournful cry, its body sinking downwards in fear of the lightning bolts.

"No need to be afraid, it's just a few divine lightning bolts," Shui Chang Tian said, his face smiling, as he comforted the whale.

As he spoke, he raised his blue long spear, and with a single hand, he drew a symbol in the air, striking the sea below.

A muffled boom echoed from the depths of the sea, and the water within a hundred million li radius began to churn and boil, as if it was being stirred by an invisible force.

Around Shui Chang Tian, massive waves and whirlpools erupted, colliding with the lightning bolts in a spectacular display.

The thunderous roar continued unabated, with golden light and water exploding in a chaotic mess, as if the boundaries between heaven and earth were becoming increasingly blurred.

Shui Chang Tian looked up at the sky, and amidst the chaos, he saw a dazzling ball of golden light, shining brightly in the center of the lightning-filled area, and the person who was supposed to be captured, standing with his arms crossed, gazing coldly at him.

"What's going on?" Shui Chang Tian wondered.

Han Li's eyes gleamed with a purple light, as he gazed through the turbulent water, seeing Zi Ling and Shi Chuan Kong fighting and retreating, having flown out several tens of thousands of li away.

"I've been in a bad mood lately, and it seems you're the unlucky one," Han Li said, his face as cold as frost.

As he spoke, he waved his hand, and a layer of golden spiritual domain expanded, enveloping the surrounding sea within a radius of ten thousand li, and the originally vast ocean was replaced by a clear moon and starry sky.

A massive mountain range rose from the sea floor, encircling the spiritual domain, with lush forests and a winding river flowing into the sea. However, the water in the river was different from the sea water, floating on top of it with a clear distinction.

"A Tian Ren realm spiritual domain..."

Shui Chang Tian saw the changes in his surroundings, and sensing the powerful time laws that were suppressing him, his brow furrowed in concern, realizing that his preparations had been insufficient.

However, this was not his fault, as the previous reports from the heavenly court had indicated that Han Li was only a Da Luo initial-stage cultivator, but now, he seemed to be a Da Luo mid-stage cultivator, and possibly even close to the late-stage.
Han Li, you've truly exceeded my expectations, to have cultivated the Time Law to such an extent that you've finally gained the attention of the Heavenly Court. However, it's a pity that the Time Law is a path that's destined to be cut off from the very beginning. 

Water Long Tian's body surged with a dense blue light, pushing back the golden light that was invisible to the naked eye.

He waved his Water Blue Long Spear with a smooth motion, not showing any signs of sluggishness from the suppression of the Time Law.

"No Fixed Wind..." Water Long Tian's voice was low and calm.

As he raised his hand, the tip of the spear touched the surface of the water, and a blue light circle rippled outward, transforming into a wave of light that expanded in all directions.

The originally turbulent sea surface suddenly became calm, as if a giant invisible hand had swept across it.

The atmosphere above the sea surface became strange, and the air currents seemed to have stopped moving in that instant. The spiritual energy in the air also solidified.

Han Li casually waved his hand, and the 72 Qingtong Bee Cloud Swords flew back to him, merging into one sword in his palm. The sword was still circulating with golden electricity, as if it hadn't had enough of the battle.

"Good, No Fixed Wind, it's clear that you're using the Water Attribute Law to exhibit the power of the Space Law." Han Li's mouth curved into a smile.

"It's just that I've taken advantage of the terrain," Water Long Tian said with a smile. "Although this Black Wind Sea is not as vast as the Murong Sea in the Middle Earth Realm, it's still sufficient for me to use my Ocean Law to deal with you."

He pointed his spear at Han Li, and the calm sea surface behind him suddenly turned into a massive wave, transforming into a gigantic tsunami that charged towards Han Li.

Han Li didn't show any fear, and with one step forward, he raised his hand.

The mountain range behind him suddenly burst forth with golden light, and it flew over his head, colliding with the tsunami.

The tsunami crashed into the mountain range, splashing up countless waves.

However, these waves didn't fall back down, but instead were infused with the Time Law, solidifying in mid-air and forming a strange water wall.

Han Li's figure shot up, and he stood on the peak of the mountain range, flying over it. His Qingtong Bee Cloud Sword slashed down towards the front.

A loud explosion echoed through the air.

A massive golden lightning bolt, guided by the sword, transformed into a gigantic golden lightning sword that split the solidified water wall, striking the sea surface.

The sound of the explosion shook the air, and the sea surface was torn apart, revealing the mountain ridges on the seafloor. The area was scorched, and a deep ravine had been carved out.

The waves spread out in all directions, affecting the sea surface tens of thousands of miles away, causing massive waves to surge and roll.

Stone Piercing the Sky and Zi Ling were being surrounded by the Heavenly Court's surveillance immortal messengers, but the massive waves disrupted their formation, allowing the two to take advantage of the situation and strike down several immortal messengers, escaping from the encirclement.

Zi Ling glanced towards Han Li's direction, but the water vapor had risen, making it impossible for her to see clearly.

"Han Li's current cultivation is not ordinary, you don't need to worry, it's actually our side that's more troublesome, we need to be careful," Stone Piercing the Sky said, reminding her.

Zi Ling understood what Stone Piercing the Sky meant, but she still had some concerns, as Han Li's state had been somewhat off since leaving the Underworld.

However, she didn't dare to divide her attention, and instead focused on facing the enemy, as if they were to lose, they would be dragging Han Li down.

Han Li's previous sword strike had been powerful, rivaling the power he had exhibited when using the Tongtian Sword Array and borrowing the power of the heavenly thunder. However, after the strike, Water Long Tian's figure had vanished.

Han Li used his Refine Spirit Technique to scan the surroundings, but he could only sense Water Long Tian's aura everywhere, without being able to pinpoint his location.

Just as the waves were subsiding, the sea surface began to churn again, and a massive whirlpool appeared beneath Han Li, emitting a powerful devouring force.

Han Li's figure shot up, and he flew towards the high air, but before he could react, the whirlpool suddenly rose up, like a giant mouth, and swallowed him whole.

Trapped in the whirlpool, the surrounding water surged in, pressing Han Li from all sides.

His hands and feet were bound by four blue water currents, which were absorbing him with an incredible force. Han Li struggled to break free, but the four water currents were too strong, and they began to pull him apart, threatening to tear him limb from limb.

At the same time, his seven orifices were invaded by small water currents, which condensed into spiral water columns that pierced through his body.

His eyes and mouth were closed, but his nose and ears were exposed, and the water columns poured into them, causing intense pain.

Han Li felt his ears and nose burning, as the water currents infused with the Law penetrated his body.
