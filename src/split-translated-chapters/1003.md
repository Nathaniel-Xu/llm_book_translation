In a dark and mysterious hall within the Golden Origin Immortal Palace, a faint red glow emanated from the intricate blood-red patterns etched into the walls and floor, forming a massive array.

As the array pulsed with an otherworldly energy, a chill ran down the spines of those who dared to approach. At the center of the array stood a black stone pillar, its seven branches adorned with ancient oil lamps that burned with a faint, eerie green flame.

The soft glow of the lamps seemed to amplify the ominous atmosphere, and suddenly, the flames erupted, growing several times larger before detaching from the lamps and floating in mid-air.

The surrounding space was filled with a network of green patterns, connecting the seven orbs of flame to form a seven-star array.

At the center of the array, a dark flash of light appeared, and a residual soul materialized, coalescing into a blurry face – that of Tao Ji.

"Fortunately, I had set up the seven-star lamps as a precaution, or I would have indeed perished," Tao Ji muttered, his eyes flashing with a malevolent glare.

"Han Li, you killed my son and destroyed my cultivation. This vendetta will not be forgotten! I may not be able to kill you, but I will stop at nothing to destroy you through the hands of others. That thing, I no longer want!"

Tao Ji's residual soul twisted into a grotesque grimace as he opened his mouth, inhaling the seven orbs of flame.

The flames rushed into his mouth, and his soul rapidly solidified.

Simultaneously, a loud crack echoed through the hall as the black stone pillar split open, revealing a hidden compartment from which a human-shaped symbol emerged, merging with Tao Ji's soul.

A brilliant black light flashed, and a figure materialized – Tao Ji, his body seemingly crafted from a dark, liquid substance.

He flexed his limbs, nodding in satisfaction, before flying towards the outside.

Half an hour later, Tao Ji arrived at the entrance of a golden palace.

"Tao Elder!"

The palace gates were flanked by two attendants, who exchanged a surprised glance upon seeing Tao Ji's current appearance.

"I have urgent business with the Palace Master. Please, announce my arrival!" Tao Ji exclaimed, his expression grave.

"Of course, Tao Elder. Please wait a moment," the attendants replied, preparing to enter the palace.

However, a stern voice from within the palace interrupted them.

"Let Tao Elder enter. There is no need to announce him."

Tao Ji pushed open the palace doors and hastened inside, traversing a grand hall and a lengthy corridor before arriving at a magnificent garden.

The garden was filled with an array of colorful flowers and trees, their sweet fragrance wafting through the air.

At the garden's center stood a white pavilion, where a white-robed figure stood with his back to Tao Ji, admiring a pale red tree.

"Greetings, Palace Master!" Tao Ji rushed forward, bowing respectfully.

The white-robed figure turned to face him, revealing a middle-aged man with an unremarkable appearance, except for his piercing eyes, which seemed to hold a deep understanding of the world.

"What brings you here, Tao Elder? You have used the Heaven's Shadow Symbol to condense your form, a move that is not to be taken lightly," the Palace Master said, his voice firm but measured.

"I beg to report, Palace Master, that I was not using the Heaven's Shadow Symbol to condense my form, but rather to revive my body, which had been destroyed. Fortunately, I had set up the seven-star lamps as a precaution, allowing me to preserve a residual soul. I had no choice but to use the Heaven's Shadow Symbol to revive my body and seek an audience with you," Tao Ji explained, his voice laced with sorrow.

The Palace Master's expression turned grave. "Who could have destroyed your body? Tell me, Tao Elder."

"It was a man named Han Li, also known as Lei Fei Yu. He is a fugitive on the Heavenly Court's list, and his crimes include cultivating the Soul Refining Technique and conspiring against the Heavenly Court. My son, Tao Yu, was also injured by him," Tao Ji spat, his eyes blazing with hatred.

The Palace Master's eyes narrowed. "Han Li... Lei Fei Yu. I recall his name. He was a True Immortal who had made a name for himself by cultivating the Soul Refining Technique and participating in the assassination of a high-ranking Heavenly Court official. A bounty of 5,000 sacred stones was placed on his head. You and he have a history of conflict, and it is only natural that you would seek to capture him. However, according to our records, he is only a True Immortal, and even if he has made significant progress in his cultivation, he should not have surpassed the Golden Immortal realm. How did you come to be defeated by him?"

Tao Ji's face twisted in a snarl. "According to our records, he has indeed surpassed the Golden Immortal realm, and his cultivation has reached the Tai Yi realm. His physical strength is also formidable, rivaling that of a Tai Yi Xian. I, along with my friend Jing Chuan and nearly a hundred Golden Immortals, set up a Yin-Yang array to capture him, but he easily broke free. Everyone else was killed, except for me."

The Palace Master's expression turned incredulous. "What? He has cultivated both the body and the soul to the Tai Yi realm? This is impossible!"

Tao Ji's eyes flashed with determination. "I swear on my honor as a cultivator that this is true. I have recorded the battle with the Heaven's Soul Pearl, and I implore you to examine it, Palace Master."

Tao Ji produced a small, crystal orb from his mouth, which hovered in the air before the Palace Master.

The Palace Master's eyes gleamed with interest as he reached out to touch the orb.

The orb burst into radiance, revealing the details of the battle between Tao Ji and Han Li. The Palace Master's eyes widened in shock as he realized the truth.

"This person's cultivation has indeed reached the Tai Yi realm, but he has only been on the list for a mere two or three thousand years," the Palace Master muttered, his voice filled with awe.
Here is the translated text:

"It seems that the only explanation is that this person hid his cultivation back then and wasn't a true immortal, no wonder my son had already become a Golden Immortal but still fell to his hands." Tao Ji said with anger.

"That's impossible, the Heavenly Court would have thoroughly investigated his background before putting him on the Annihilation List, and his cultivation level would be the most important thing, there's no way they would make a mistake!" The white-clothed man shook his head.

"If the investigation back then was correct, then it's impossible for him to have gone from the True Immortal realm to the Taiyi realm in just a few thousand years, and also cultivate his physical body to the same level. This is impossible! Even if he has the best talent and has a powerful backing, his cultivation couldn't have increased so quickly, unless he has some kind of heaven-defying treasure that can shorten his cultivation time... Ah!" Tao Ji shook his head, his eyes suddenly focusing on something.

"What did you think of, Tao Long?" The white-clothed man was deep in thought, but was interrupted by Tao Ji's sudden exclamation.

"I remember something, but it's related to my son Tao Yu," Tao Ji said.

"What is it?" The white-clothed man asked.

"My son had a feud with Lü Fei Yu in the Northern Cold Immortal Domain, and he had sent back some information about him. I remember some of it was about a time law treasure. Previously, I was too caught up in my grief over my son's death, and didn't investigate further, but could it be related to Lü Fei Yu's sudden increase in cultivation?" Tao Ji said.

"What information?" The white-clothed man's spirit was shaken.

"It's been a long time, and I don't remember it clearly, but I still have the records. Let me send for them, and we can take a look," Tao Ji said quickly, then took out a communication array plate and whispered a few words.

A moment later, a golden-robed young man flew in from outside and bowed to the two of them.

"Greetings, Palace Master, Tao Uncle."

"No need to be polite, did you bring the things I asked for?" Tao Ji said.

"Regarding Tao Yu's records, they're all here," the golden-robed young man said, taking out a stack of jade slips and placing them on the stone table.

The white-clothed man didn't pay attention to the golden-robed young man, instead taking a jade slip and examining it.

"Ah!" The white-clothed man's face showed excitement as he looked at a white jade slip, his eyes flashing with intensity.

"Palace Master, did you find something?" Tao Ji asked.

The white-clothed man glanced at Tao Ji, then handed him the jade slip.

Tao Ji took the jade slip, and his divine sense entered it, finding a record of Tao Yu sending back a message, vaguely mentioning that he was investigating someone who had a crystal treasure that contained time laws.

"Right, it's this, the time law crystal, Palace Master, do you think it's related to Lü Fei Yu's sudden increase in cultivation?" Tao Ji asked quickly.

"Now that we've found the thread, we can contact the Observatory and find the source of the Chaos Crystal!" The white-clothed man said excitedly, immediately striding towards the depths of the garden.

"What, this crystal is the Chaos Crystal?" Tao Ji's eyes widened in surprise, following after him.

"Although we can't be certain, there's a 70-80% chance, according to the Observatory's records, the Chaos Crystal has the effect of accelerating law cultivation, and can also be used to mature spiritual herbs, it's a first-class treasure that can quickly increase cultivation. Lü Fei Yu's cultivation speed is so fast, and he has the time law crystal, it's unlikely that it's just a coincidence, that crystal is likely the Chaos Crystal!" The white-clothed man said quickly.

"I see, it's indeed very likely! Ai, I'm to blame for being too careless in the past, and not investigating this matter thoroughly, we missed the chance to capture him. Luckily, Palace Master, you're so perceptive and noticed the crystal's origin," Tao Ji said, nodding.

The white-clothed man stopped in his tracks, turning to look at Tao Ji, his eyes deep and profound.

"Palace Master?" Tao Ji also stopped, looking puzzled.

"Tao Long, did you really not notice the crystal's existence, or did you intentionally hide it, wanting to keep the treasure for yourself, but Lü Fei Yu's power was too great, and you couldn't get your hands on it, so you revealed this matter?" The white-clothed man's eyes flashed with white light, becoming two white blades that stared intensely at Tao Ji.

A massive aura burst forth from his body, pressing down on Tao Ji.

"Palace Master, I assure you, that treasure is related to the rise and fall of the Nine Yuan Observatory, even if I had a million courage, I wouldn't dare have such thoughts, it's really just that I noticed it now!" Tao Ji's face changed, and he fell to his knees, wailing.

The white-clothed man didn't pay attention to Tao Ji's wailing, his eyes flashing with white light, becoming brighter and brighter.

Tao Ji's body shook uncontrollably, his head bowed repeatedly.

"Hmph! Regardless of whether you're telling the truth or not, you've done some merit in finding the Chaos Crystal's thread. Now, you can go, later the Immortal Palace will choose a suitable body for you to reincarnate into," the white-clothed man said, his eyes flashing with white light, then suddenly dimming, and his body disappearing into thin air.

Tao Ji saw this, and his face relaxed, slowly standing up, wiping his forehead, and walking towards the outside.

A sly smile flashed in his eyes, and then disappeared.

The white-clothed man reappeared, his eyes still flashing with white light, his body disappearing into thin air once again.

Tao Ji saw this, and his face changed, his eyes narrowing, and his body disappearing into the shadows.
