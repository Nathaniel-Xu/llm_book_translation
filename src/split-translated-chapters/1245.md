Han Li pondered for a moment, then lightly touched the wall's opening with two fingers, and placed them on his brow. His eyes immediately lit up.

The remaining aura at the opening was familiar, it belonged to Jintong.

Jintong had indeed escaped to this place after fleeing from the Ghost Valley, but Han Li didn't know what she was doing here.

Of course, the aura of Qushan was also present in the cave, and it seemed that he had also pursued her here.

Han Li's eyes flashed, and he muttered to himself, transforming into a dark shadow as he flew into the cave. He moved swiftly, like a snake, and soon reached the other side of the wall.

On the other side of the wall was a grand hall, shaped like a square, with a width of several hundred feet. The entire hall was made of golden-colored Heavenly Absolute Rock, including the floor, and the air was filled with a strong, golden aura.

Although the hall was empty, the fact that it was entirely made of Heavenly Absolute Rock gave it an exceptionally grand and majestic atmosphere.

"An entire palace made of Heavenly Absolute Rock, what a grand gesture," Han Li couldn't help but exclaim.

"Brother Han, I remember something," Lan Cang's voice echoed in Han Li's mind. "In the Nine Origins Observations, there is a legendary sacred hall called the Nine Origins Palace, which is said to be the foundation of the Nine Origins Sect. It's rumored that the Nine Origins Ancestor created it using a massive piece of golden law material. This might be it."

"Nine Origins Palace! What is it used for?" Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he asked.

"I'm not sure, but I know it's a sacred place of the Nine Origins Sect, possibly a place for closed-door cultivation. The golden law aura here is extremely strong, and many people in the Nine Origins Sect cultivate golden law. Be careful, Brother Han, if you take action here," Lan Cang's voice echoed again.

Han Li nodded slowly, activating his Nine Yin Magic Eye to continue searching for Qushan's spiritual energy trail.

The golden law aura in this place was too dense, interfering with Han Li's senses, but he managed to find Qushan's trail by amplifying his Nine Yin Magic Eye's power. He followed the trail to the deepest part of the hall.

There was a side door, which Han Li opened, revealing a garden. The garden's floor was also made of Heavenly Absolute Rock, but the flowerbeds were filled with various colored spiritual soil, and the plants growing in them were all golden law spiritual plants.

Han Li ignored the plants and continued to follow the spiritual energy trail. The Nine Origins Observations' area was quite large, but the visibility was limited, and it was difficult to extend his divine sense too far.

He passed through two gardens and four or five palaces, but still hadn't found any signs of Jintong or Qushan.

Han Li's brow furrowed, this place wasn't safe, and he didn't know where Jintong and Qushan had gone. Continuing to wander around could lead to danger.

As he walked through another palace, Han Li's eyes suddenly lit up, and he flew forward quickly.

Because he sensed two intense auras clashing, accompanied by a loud rumbling sound, indicating that someone was fighting.

The two auras belonged to Jintong and Qushan.

Han Li flew over a corridor, and the scenery in front of him suddenly opened up. A massive square, about 40-50 acres in size, appeared before him.

The square was surrounded by massive golden pillars, with array patterns and seals engraved on them, resembling a formation. However, it wasn't activated.

In the air above the square, two giant, golden beetles were rapidly entwining and fighting each other, forming two golden illusions that danced and spun around each other.

Golden light flew out of the battle circle, striking the ground and producing a muffled thunderous sound.

The square's floor was also made of Heavenly Absolute Rock, but Jintong and Qushan's attacks were so powerful that the ground was still being torn apart, and several of the golden pillars were broken.

Jintong and Qushan were fighting fiercely, their golden light and aura bursting out like two giant mouths, devouring each other.

It had been many years since Han Li last saw Jintong, and her Devouring Gold Insect form had become even more majestic and terrifying. Her aura had reached the early stages of the Grand Luo Realm, nearing its peak.

However, Qushan's aura was even more massive, having reached the peak of the early Grand Luo Realm, and was only a step away from advancing to the middle stage of the Grand Luo Realm. He was suppressing Jintong.

"Haha! If I devour you, I'll be able to reach the middle stage of the Grand Luo Realm, and even break through to the late stage! Become a part of my body, you and I were originally one!" Qushan laughed loudly.

"No way!" Jintong gritted her teeth, struggling to hold on.

Qushan sneered, and his golden light surged again, forming a 20-30-acre golden spiritual domain that covered nearly half of the square.

A series of giant golden swords and knives appeared within the domain, forming a world of swords and knives.

Jintong was trapped within the domain, surrounded by a cage of golden swords and knives that seemed to be made of solid gold.

The swords and knives struck Jintong's body, producing a shower of golden sparks.

But Jintong's Devouring Gold Insect body was extremely resilient, and she was only left with white scars, without taking any damage. However, her movements were momentarily halted, and she was trapped within the cage of swords and knives.

Jintong's eyes flashed with a fierce light, and her body began to glow with golden light, forming a golden spiritual domain.

Innumerable golden beetle illusions appeared within the domain, similar to Jintong's, but with larger mouths and sharper teeth. They immediately attacked the golden swords and knives, biting and devouring them.

The golden beetle illusions were especially dense around Jintong, and they bit and devoured the swords and knives with reckless abandon.
In the midst of the crisp sounds of "crack" and "crack", the sword cage surrounding Jin Tong rapidly disintegrated, and in the blink of an eye, nearly half of it was consumed, and it seemed as though he would soon break free.

But at this moment, a flash of golden light appeared above Jin Tong's head, and Qu Lin's figure suddenly materialized, his two front claws swooping down from the air.

The golden swords within Qu Lin's spiritual domain instantly converged, gathering at a single point before condensing into two massive golden swords, each over a hundred feet in length.

The giant swords presented three faces, resembling a triangular shape, emitting a killing aura that seemed to be able to absorb all life force and extinguish everything.

"Slash!"

Qu Lin softly spoke a single word, and the two triangular giant swords shot out, slicing towards Jin Tong.

Jin Tong's eyes flashed with a hint of fear, and a sharp cry escaped his lips.

The golden insect shadows surrounding him flew up, pouncing towards the two golden giant swords, but they were all annihilated by the terrifying sword energy emanating from the three-edged swords, resembling moths being incinerated by flames.

The two golden giant swords appeared blurry, suddenly materializing above Jin Tong's head, three feet away, and crossed, slicing downwards.

Jin Tong's eyes flashed with a resolute color, and his body's golden light flickered, as if he was about to unleash a divine technique.

But at this moment, a golden light wave rapidly expanded, enveloping Jin Tong and Qu Lin, revealing another golden spiritual domain, filled with a powerful time law force.

The two triangular giant swords were enveloped by the time spiritual domain, and their descent speed immediately slowed by more than tenfold.

Then, a rumbling sound echoed from the nearby void, and a small mountain-like golden hand materialized, its surface flashing with countless golden talismans, grasping the two triangular giant swords.

"What?!" Qu Lin's face changed, and his hands formed a seal.

But his movements were also slowed by tenfold, and he couldn't keep up.

The golden hand's five fingers clenched with incredible force, unleashing an immense spiritual pressure that exploded above Qu Lin and Jin Tong.

A loud "bang" resounded!

The two triangular giant swords were crushed, shattering into pieces.

Then, Jin Tong's head was surrounded by a void, and Han Li's figure emerged.

"Uncle!" Jin Tong exclaimed, his eyes filled with joy upon seeing Han Li.

"It's you! How could you possibly escape from Gui Lingzi's hands?" Qu Lin's face revealed an expression of disbelief upon seeing Han Li.

"Hmph!" Han Li's anger flared up upon hearing Qu Lin mention Gui Lingzi, and his figure vanished from the spot.

Qu Lin's face changed, and he cast a hateful glance at Jin Tong, his massive body rapidly shrinking, transforming into a golden phantom that flew towards the distance, escaping.

Jin Tong and Han Li seemed to be allies.

With Jin Tong already being a formidable opponent, adding Han Li to the mix made Qu Lin realize he was no match for them.

However, Qu Lin didn't fly far before Han Li's figure reappeared, blocking his path, arriving before him by an unknown margin.

Qu Lin's face revealed a look of shock, and he let out a furious roar, his two front claws transforming into two golden streaks, slashing towards Han Li.

Han Li's face turned cold, and his figure vanished once more, reappearing beside Qu Lin, his right fist surrounded by golden lightning, striking Qu Lin's waist.

A loud "bang" resounded, and Qu Lin's entire body was sent flying.

At this moment, Qu Lin's two front claws were still in the midst of their slashing motion, but they had only moved less than half a foot, and their speed was comparable to a slow-moving cow.

Han Li had activated his Reverse True Wheel technique.

In his leisure time, he had been continuously refining this technique, although it was still incomplete, it allowed him to accelerate by 20-30 times, and when combined with the time spiritual domain, he could surpass any enemy in speed.

Qu Lin was sent flying, and a deep fist mark appeared on his waist, but his golden armor remained intact.

"Indeed, it's quite hard!" Han Li muttered, his figure vanishing once more, reappearing beside Qu Lin, and striking again.

Another loud "bang" resounded, and Qu Lin was sent flying once more.

Han Li created over a hundred residual shadows, swirling around Qu Lin like a whirlwind, as countless golden fist silhouettes emitted a thunderous roar, tearing through the air, and heavily striking Qu Lin's body.

One punch, another punch, and another!

Clang, clang, clang, clang!

Qu Lin's body was tossed about in mid-air, his mouth bleeding, and his heart filled with an extreme sense of fear.

Although his body was incredibly resilient, it had its limits, and Han Li's fists were incredibly powerful, and if he continued to endure the blows, his body would soon be unable to withstand it.
