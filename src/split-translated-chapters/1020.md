Lü Yun's words had barely fallen when the flames and lightning on the square had gradually dissipated, and Dongfang Bai's figure reappeared.

However, at this moment, he no longer had the calm and collected demeanor of before. His entire body had turned into a charred, carbon-like state, with rolling black smoke emanating from his body. His chest area still had a flickering green glow, and thin, green lines spread out from it, like blood vessels, covering his entire body.

Wherever the green lines passed, a strong life force spread out, reviving his seemingly lifeless body, and slowly restoring it.

Just then, Han Li's figure flashed by, his palm and fingers forming a knife-like shape as he chopped horizontally.

Dongfang Bai's charred head immediately fell to the ground, and with a kick from Han Li, it turned into a pile of carbon dust.

At the same time, a green bamboo sword appeared, piercing through the charred remains of Dongfang Bai's chest, releasing a golden electric current that instantly shattered the green glow, dispersing it like fireflies.

Han Li stood holding his sword, his face expressionless, but his eyebrows furrowed in puzzlement as he looked towards the nearby stone floor.

A small, weak wild grass grew out of the crack in the stone, swaying gently in the wind. Suddenly, a green light burst forth, and the grass rapidly grew, its leaves spreading out, transforming into a human figure in the blink of an eye.

The figure was Dongfang Bai.

"The Wood Element's laws are quite interesting..." Han Li's eyes flickered, and he smiled.

"Enough of these petty tricks, Han Li. It's time to conclude this." Dongfang Bai said coldly.

As soon as he finished speaking, he lightly rubbed his palms together, and the blue spirit domain surrounding him burst into a brilliant light. In the void within, countless blue light points appeared, and a powerful Wood Element law force emanated from them, causing Han Li's heart to tremble.

Han Li saw this and his pupils constricted, as he instinctively retreated backwards.

"Forest... Thousand... Images!" Dongfang Bai shouted, his voice somewhat unsteady.

Suddenly, thick, sturdy branches and vines emerged from the blue light screen, stretching out into the void, and massive trees burst forth, instantly overturning the entire Qingjing Sect's ancestral hall.

This area, which was once at the bottom of a lake, was transformed into a lush forest landscape in an instant.

The four angry-looking golden giants guarding the small hill were entwined by the rapidly growing vines, covered in a layer of blue moss, and quickly buried, losing contact with Han Li.

Even the Xīnghuǒ, which had transformed into a demon, was entangled by the vines with golden patterns, and was unable to move.

Han Li, who had retreated several hundred meters, was still covered in the blue moss, and his entire body seemed to have transformed into a plant, rooted to the ground, unable to move.

"I've seen many spirit domains, but this is truly breathtaking." Han Li, trapped, glanced at Xīnghuǒ, seeing that she was unharmed but unable to move, and his heart relaxed slightly.

"If the Sect Master hadn't devoted himself to cultivating his spirit domain, he would have surpassed the Taiyi Peak realm by now. But who would dare to underestimate him as just a Taiyi Peak cultivator?" Lü Yun said with a smile.

Tao Ji's expression changed, and he felt even more reverence for Dongfang Bai.

"Whether you hand over the item or not, it makes no difference." Dongfang Bai walked towards Han Li, smiling.

"I already knew that." Han Li said calmly.

As he spoke, he secretly activated his celestial spirit energy, but it was instantly absorbed by the golden-patterned vines wrapped around his body.

At this moment, he couldn't even circulate his energy, let alone summon his true mantra wheel.

He clenched his fists, and discovered that his star energy was also being absorbed, although at a slower rate.

"Don't waste your energy. Trapped in my spirit domain, everything you have belongs to me. Once I've drained your celestial spirit energy, your powerful body will become nourishment for my domain, and your nascent soul will become my slave, serving me for all eternity." Dongfang Bai approached Han Li, his smile growing more intense.

His gaze fell on Han Li's neck, where a thin rope was wrapped, and he reached out to touch it.

But just then, Han Li's voice rang out:

"Don't touch my things!"

As soon as he spoke, his body was enveloped in a surge of bloody light, and the Tiānxiè Túyù Gong was activated, his body rapidly expanding, transforming into a three-headed, six-armed giant.

Dongfang Bai felt a strange energy emanating from Han Li's body, and his heart trembled slightly as he retreated.

As he created distance between himself and Han Li, he manipulated his spirit domain, and the countless vines within surged towards Han Li, engulfing his entire body.

Han Li took a step forward, and the vines wrapped around him snapped, unable to restrain him.

The vines continued to entwine him, but Han Li's body seemed to be able to break free from them with ease.
Dongfang Bai saw the situation and swung his hands fiercely, causing the spiritual domain within him to shake violently. The ancient trees above surged with green light, transforming into eighteen giant wooden warriors, each over a hundred feet tall, holding massive dragon-shaped wooden spears. They charged towards Han Li.

The wooden warriors' bodies were filled with the dense power of wood-attribute laws. As they thrust their spears, the tips of the spears condensed into spiraling green lights that tore through the surrounding void, twisting towards the spear tips.

Han Li swung his six arms, either punching or clawing, showing no fear. Within a dozen breaths, he had destroyed eight of the wooden warriors and burst out of the encirclement, leaping high into the air and descending towards Dongfang Bai.

However, Dongfang Bai had already stood firm, his body shining with green light. Innumerable green vines wrapped around him, gathering on his body and submerging him. He transformed into a giant wooden warrior, over a hundred feet tall.

But unlike the previous warriors, his wooden armor was covered in golden patterns. Besides containing extremely dense wood-attribute laws, it also emanated a rich life aura.

As Han Li descended, Dongfang Bai raised his left hand, and a golden-patterned whip shot out, wrapping around Han Li's waist. With a fierce pull, he yanked Han Li downwards, while his other hand grasped a golden-patterned wooden spear, thrusting it towards Han Li's heart.

Han Li's waist was bound, and he felt his inner blood flow surging like a bursting river, crazily pouring outwards. If not for his incredibly strong physique, he would have collapsed already.

He extended his dragon claw-like hand, intending to grab the golden-patterned wooden spear. However, the spear tip suddenly erupted with a burst of green light, its power far exceeding his imagination, and it shattered his giant hand, piercing his chest.

A deafening "Boom" echoed through the air!

The golden-patterned wooden spear released a boundless, surging spiritual energy, bursting forth with a dazzling green-gold light. The energy exploded, sending a violent shockwave in all directions, causing the entire spiritual domain to tremble.

Lü Yun and Tao Ji watched from a distance, their hearts filled with shock and awe.

The imprisoned Ti Hu, whose spiritual energy had been mostly drained, had transformed back into her human form. Her small face was pale, and she gazed at Han Li with a concerned expression.

However, when the shockwave dissipated, Han Li's figure remained motionless, the golden-patterned wooden spear still lodged in his chest.

"This... how is this possible?" Dongfang Bai's heart tightened as he beheld the scene.

"You shouldn't have underestimated me," Han Li said with a ferocious grin, his voice like thunder. "Even if you have the power of the Taizong, you're no match for me."

His current body, when using both his bloodline and Heaven-Devouring Demon Domain, was far more powerful than an ordinary Da Luo cultivator. Dongfang Bai's spiritual domain was strong, but ultimately, he was no match for Han Li's might.

Han Li spoke, and then his body descended, forcing the golden-patterned wooden spear to bend. He grasped the golden-patterned whip wrapped around his waist and pulled Dongfang Bai towards him.

His six arms formed fists, raining down a barrage of punches on the wooden warrior's body.

A series of explosive sounds echoed through the air as the entire green spiritual domain shook violently.

Dongfang Bai's wooden warrior body glowed with green light, attempting to block Han Li's heavy punches, but it could only withstand half of them. Soon, it was battered to fragments, its body broken and tattered.

Lü Yun and Tao Ji exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with fear.

With their strength, they were no match for this battle. Even Han Li's physical strength, which was pouring out like a river, was something they couldn't withstand.

Before long, Dongfang Bai's figure emerged from the shattered wooden warrior, and he was grasped by Han Li.

"You should not have pushed things too far," Han Li said, his three true spirit heads speaking in unison, their voices like thunder. "Why did you not spare the Qinghu City, a small tribe's home?"

"Originally, it was because of those insects—"

"Ah—"

Dongfang Bai's words were cut short as Han Li clenched his fist, crushing him into a pulp.

After a moment, blood flowed from Han Li's fingers, but there was no sign of an escaping Nascent Soul.

He threw the distorted corpse to the ground, his body slowly returning to normal. His brow furrowed as he gazed towards Lü Yun and Tao Ji.

Near them, a green sprout on a nearby plant began to glow, growing larger and transforming into a human figure – another Dongfang Bai.

The previous Dongfang Bai's body, bound by green vines, had been absorbed into the ground, covered in green moss.

"It seems today's outcome is already decided," the newly appeared Dongfang Bai said, his face somewhat gloomy. "It seems I won't be able to claim all the credit. Han Daoist, we will meet again."

"You think you can leave?" Han Li sneered, his voice cold.

As soon as he spoke, a golden light screen expanded, and a more dazzling golden spiritual domain emerged within the green spiritual domain.

"Too late," Han Li said, his voice dripping with malice.
