Here is the translation of the chapter:

A moment later, Ti Hu's eyebrows furrowed, and the crimson silk threads flew back into his eyes.

The remaining soul of the old man Creek Teng immediately flashed with a bloody light, and then completely dissipated.

"How was it?" Xiao Bai asked curiously.

"This guy left a hand behind when he self-destructed, and most of the memories in his soul have already dissipated on their own. The remaining memories are also incomplete, but the part about Qu Lin is still clear. It seems that they weren't targeting Qu Lin alone." Ti Hu said with a furrowed brow.

"What do you mean?" Han Li asked.

"According to his memories, the Heavenly Court seems to be collecting and capturing cultivators with special law powers. Qu Lin's true form is a Golden Devouring Immortal, and he cultivates a rare devouring law, which is why they're after him." Ti Hu said.

"Did he know why they were capturing these cultivators?" Han Li asked.

"There's no information about that in this Creek Teng's memories. He probably didn't know either, and was just following orders." Ti Hu said.

Han Li's expression turned contemplative upon hearing this.

Ti Hu's wrist turned, and a black storage bangle appeared in his palm. After refining it, he searched through it.

"Ha ha, it's back in my hands." Ti Hu said with a smile, taking out the black ghost flute and playing with it.

"Senior Han, Senior Ti Hu, I have a request..." Lan Yan suddenly knelt down and bowed.

Ti Hu was surprised, and took a step back.

Han Li knew what Lan Yan wanted, and didn't move, accepting her bow.

"You want Senior Ti Hu to use the Yin Soul Secret Art to save Lan Yuanzi, right?" Han Li asked, looking at her.

"Please, Senior Ti Hu, help me... no matter what you want me to do, I'll do it." Lan Yan begged, her voice trembling.

Ti Hu's eyebrows furrowed, and he turned to Han Li.

Han Li didn't speak, but nodded and transmitted a few words to Ti Hu.

"I can help you, but I've never done this before, and I'm not sure if I'll succeed." Ti Hu said after a moment.

Lan Yan looked up at Ti Hu, and her eyes flashed with a hint of hesitation.

But soon, her expression turned resolute again, and she said, "As long as Senior Ti Hu is willing to help, I'll be eternally grateful. As for whether it'll succeed, that's up to fate."

"Alright, since you're so sincere, I'll help you. But if my master has any requests for you in the future, you should know what to do." Ti Hu nodded.

"I've already said that I'll do anything, even if it means giving up my life." Lan Yan said solemnly.

"Qu Lin, what are your plans now?" Han Li asked.

"I came to this Great Jin Yuan Immortal Domain because I sensed the presence of someone like me. Although I almost got caught just now, I'm not leaving yet. After I recover, I'll continue on to the Nine Yuan City." Qu Lin said.

"Since we're headed in the same direction, why don't we travel together?" Han Li suggested.

Qu Lin didn't respond immediately, but instead thought for a moment.

Han Li didn't press him, and waited for his answer. Qu Lin's cautious nature made him wary of being persuaded, and Han Li knew that the more he tried to convince him, the more likely he was to resist.

"Master, why are you inviting him to travel with us? He looks like a wolf in sheep's clothing, and it's not safe to have him by our side." Xiao Bai asked via transmission.

"This guy is probably here because he was attracted by the aura of the Golden Child. Having him with us will make it easier to find the Golden Child's trail later on." Han Li replied.

"I see, so it's for the sake of the Golden Child. In that case, it's fine." Xiao Bai nodded.

"If we travel together, it'll be easier to take care of each other, but won't it be easier to expose our tracks if there are more people? And what if the Red Dream finds us?" Qu Lin asked cautiously.

"Don't worry about that, Qu Lin. If you travel with me, you can just hide in my Cave Heaven treasure, and the Red Dream won't be able to find you." Han Li smiled.

"If that's the case, then I'll trouble you, Senior Han. I'll travel with you." Qu Lin said.

"Very well, I'll have you stay in the bamboo pavilion in my Cave Heaven to rest and recover. Please forgive me for the inconvenience." Han Li said.

"No need to apologize, no need to apologize." Qu Lin nodded.

Han Li waved his hand, and a silver light door appeared in the air, leading to the bamboo pavilion in the Spirit Medicine Garden.

Qu Lin bowed and stepped through the door.

Han Li smiled and said, "Let's go."
Han Li stepped into the room and looked around, discovering that the room was filled with spiritual energy and that there were restrictive arrays set up around the perimeter.

These arrays were naturally unable to block him, but if he were to destroy them, Han Li would immediately sense it. Given Han Li's current strength, Qū Lín was not confident that he could guarantee a victory.

As he pondered, he walked into the room and sat down on a soft couch, closing his eyes to meditate.

"Blue Yuan's soul is incomplete, do you have a method to help him?" Han Li asked, closing the silver light door behind him and turning to face Tí Hún.

"I have a secret technique to nurture souls, which can first nurture his soul and then find a new body for him to possess," Tí Hún replied.

"Thank you, Tí Hún," Blue Yuan said, tears of joy in his eyes.

"You should thank our master," Tí Hún said.

"Thank you, Han Li," Blue Yuan said, bowing his head.

Han Li was about to speak when he suddenly felt a sense of awareness, and with a wave of his hand, the silver light door reappeared, revealing the original bamboo building in the flower branch space.

"Tí Hún, take them back to the cave to cultivate and nurture Blue Yuan's soul," Han Li said.

Tí Hún nodded and walked into the light door, followed by Blue Yuan and Xiao Bai.

After they left, Han Li closed the silver light door and took out a red mask from the Wheel of Rebirth Temple, covering his face.

As the mask glowed with a crystalline light, a red light screen appeared before him.

In the light screen, a slender figure emerged.

Han Li looked at the figure and immediately recognized it as Jiǎo Sān.

"Jiǎo Sān, you've finally contacted me," Han Li said, smiling.

"Sorry, I've been busy lately, and I only managed to contact you now," Jiǎo Sān said, her eyes widening in surprise. "Han Li, your strength has increased significantly, have you reached the Great Luo Realm?"

"Jiǎo Sān, you have a keen eye, how did you see through my cultivation?" Han Li asked.

"I was taught a technique to sense a person's aura and cultivation level through their shadow and expression," Jiǎo Sān said, smiling. "But it's not a big deal, let's not talk about it. Where are you now, Han Li?"

"I've entered the Great Golden Source Heavenly Domain, I have some things to take care of," Han Li replied, recalling Jiǎo Sān's previous warning.

"No problem, the situation in the Great Golden Source Heavenly Domain is different from before, you can enter without any issues," Jiǎo Sān said, smiling.

Han Li's eyes flickered, and he sensed that Jiǎo Sān was also in the Great Golden Source Heavenly Domain.

"Jiǎo Sān, have you contacted me to begin the task?" Han Li asked.

"Yes, I have. Can you reach the Ninth Yuan City within 30 years?" Jiǎo Sān asked, her expression serious.

"No problem," Han Li replied, calculating the distance between the Golden City and the Ninth Yuan City.

"That's good, and there's another thing, Han Li, since you've reached the Great Luo Realm, please take this," Jiǎo Sān said, waving her hand.

A black mask appeared in the transmission array, identical to the one Han Li wore, with the name "Dragon Five" written on it.

"The Wheel of Rebirth Temple's masks come in four colors: blue, green, red, and black, representing our identity and status within the temple," Jiǎo Sān explained. "The black mask is the symbol of the temple's core members."

"Is the Wheel of Rebirth Temple planning to promote me to a core member?" Han Li asked, taking the black mask.

"Our temple master has long heard of your name and wishes to summon you, but due to his busy schedule, he hasn't had the chance," Jiǎo Sān replied. "However, he intends to promote you to a core member after the Ninth Yuan City task is completed. To become a core member, one must have exceptional talent and have made significant contributions to the temple. You, Han Li, have made rapid progress and reached the Great Luo Realm, but you still lack contributions. Our temple master wishes to ensure your safety during the Ninth Yuan City task, so I was ordered to give you this black mask ahead of time. After the task is completed, you will be formally promoted."

"Temple Master!" Han Li's heart skipped a beat.

He had heard of the temple master's reputation and knew that he was an extraordinary person, possibly even a Dao Ancestor.

Hearing that this person had been paying attention to him, Han Li felt a sense of trepidation.

"Thank you, Temple Master and Jiǎo Sān, for your kindness," Han Li said, then expanded his divine sense to examine the black mask.

The mask felt weightless and invisible, as if it didn't exist at all.

Han Li's eyes lit up with excitement, realizing that the black mask's ability to conceal his aura was far superior to the red mask's. He wondered how many precious materials had been used to create it, and how much effort had gone into its creation.

He couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and gratitude towards the temple master and Jiǎo Sān for their trust in him.
