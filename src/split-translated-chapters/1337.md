"Have you found out which two of the Eight Reincarnated Ones were responsible?" Xuan Yuan Jie's eyes twitched slightly as he asked.

"It was Yan Zuo and Xuan Yu, they didn't even try to hide their identities, and they even destroyed the ancestral hall of the Tong Qiu True Person's sect, it seems they're not afraid of Heaven's pursuit and revenge." The person replied.

"Track down their whereabouts, those two must die, I want to take their divine souls to create a puppet." Xuan Yuan Jie opened his hand, and his voice carried a sense of authority.

The people below were about to respond, but they saw Xuan Yuan Jie's expression suddenly change, and their hearts followed suit, rising to their throats.

"Ah, ah, ah... I didn't think that after so many years, you'd actually be able to take this step again, this time I want to see if you still have a chance to escape?" Xuan Yuan Jie said, his voice filled with laughter.

The people didn't understand what was going on, and they didn't dare to speak up, they could only stand there silently.

"Lu Qing Shan, Zhao Yao, you two are in charge of investigating Yan Zuo and Xuan Yu, the rest of you follow me..." Xuan Yuan Jie suddenly shouted.

"Yes, sir!" The people replied in unison.

...

In the Dragon Abyss Heavenly Domain, on the Qing Yuan Continent.

A vast expanse of clear blue sky stretched out, meeting the endless blue waters below, reflecting each other's beauty.

Between the sky and the sea, two figures flashed by, leaving behind a long trail of golden light, causing a strong ripple in the space.

The two figures were a young man and woman, the man was tall and had a strong build, with a thick beard and a nose that wasn't too high, but he had a rugged look. The woman was wearing a blue palace dress, and she had a gentle and elegant appearance.

"Juan Er, we agreed that once we reach the Qing Yuan Continent, you'll head back to the Flower Branch Cave Heaven, and I'll enter the Tong Tian Tower alone, heading to the Middle Earth Heavenly Domain." The bearded man said to the woman.

This woman was none other than Nan Gong Juan, and the bearded man was of course Han Li.

"I know, I'm just a bit worried, you're using the Heaven's transmission array to go to the Middle Earth Heavenly Domain, won't you be discovered and cause a commotion?" Nan Gong Juan asked, her eyebrows furrowed.

"It's fine, I have the Bodhi Order in my hand, they'll just think I'm a noble guest from Heaven, they won't investigate further. Besides, they probably wouldn't think that I'd dare to do something like this." Han Li shook his head.

"You're right, I feel better now." Nan Gong Juan nodded.

As they spoke, they saw the black coastline of the Qing Yuan Continent in the distance, several thousand miles away.

Just then, a strange ripple suddenly appeared in front of them.

Han Li's mind moved, and he stopped, pulling Nan Gong Juan behind him, and gazing forward.

They saw a black cloud hovering above the coastline, with a mixture of strange noises and bug sounds coming from it.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and he felt a strange sensation in his heart.

But after a moment, the black cloud had already flown several hundred miles closer, and its appearance became clearer, but it was a sight that made one's skin crawl.

They saw that within a radius of several hundred miles, there were countless spirit insects, with the larger ones being several hundred feet long, resembling giant stag beetles, and the smaller ones being only a few inches long, resembling worms.

If it was just a single species of insect, it wouldn't be strange, but this massive swarm of insects, with countless species mixed together, was a problem.

"This doesn't feel right..." Han Li said, his brow furrowed.

"It's an insect tide, the Spirit Realm has them too, but the scale is not this large... what do you think is off?" Nan Gong Juan asked.

"Insect tides usually occur when a single species of spirit insect gathers to perform a large-scale devouring and destructive action. But this insect tide has a mix of species, including those that are natural enemies. Like the Star Pattern Rhinoceros Beetle and the Flameless Moth, they should be fighting each other to the death, but here they're marching together without conflict, this is very strange." Han Li said, his voice filled with contemplation.

As he spoke, his expression suddenly changed, and he saw a giant golden insect, over a hundred feet long, emerge from the swarm, its body radiating powerful energy.

This insect was none other than a Devouring Gold Beetle, a spirit insect that had reached the peak of the Tai Yi Realm.

"Juan Er, don't move, wait for me." Han Li said, his brow furrowed.

Before Nan Gong Juan could respond, Han Li's figure flashed, and he disappeared from his original position.

The next moment, he reappeared in front of the insect tide, his body surrounded by a golden light, and a domain expanded, covering a radius of several hundred miles.

The insect tide was frozen in place, with some still glowing with spirit energy, and others still in mid-air, but they were all motionless, as if they had been petrified.
Even the water below was momentarily frozen in place, with ripples on the surface condensing into a stillness.

Han Li's figure entered the swarm of insects, flashing through the dense crowd of spiritual insects to arrive in front of the Jin Tong Xian.

With one hand, he pointed to his own brow, and a crystal light shot out, piercing into Jin Tong Xian's skull, before disappearing without a trace.

Han Li closed his eyes for a moment, then suddenly raised an eyebrow, opening his eyes to say, "Such a big deal, and yet you didn't tell me, truly reckless..."

He then flashed back to Nan Gong Wan's side.

"What's going on?" Nan Gong Wan asked with concern.

"Looking at this situation, Jin Tong is probably going to break through to the next realm, and all these spiritual insects are here to escort her," Han Li said with a furrowed brow.

"Breaking through... is she already at the late stage of Da Luo?" Nan Gong Wan asked in surprise.

Han Li shook his head, saying, "It's not the late stage of Da Luo, she's going to re-merge her dao and become a Dao Ancestor."

"What...?" Nan Gong Wan's expression changed, finding it hard to believe.

"Jin Tong's devouring law is an innate ability, her cultivation is different from ordinary people, and she's originally a true body of a Dao Ancestor, so now she's just re-aggregating after generations of devouring, and doesn't need to sever her three corpses, and her speed can't be measured by ordinary standards," Han Li explained, looking at the frozen swarm of insects.

"This isn't a good thing, why do you look so worried?" Nan Gong Wan asked.

"You see this massive swarm of insects, it's probably not just an isolated incident in the Dragon Abyss Heavenly Domain, it's likely that similar scenes are playing out in many places in the heavenly domains. Making such a big commotion, it's hard to guarantee that the people of the Heavenly Court won't notice," Han Li said thoughtfully.

"If that's the case, then the risk is indeed not small, what do you plan to do?" Nan Gong Wan asked, also understanding the situation.

"I need to go help her, escort her through this process," Han Li said, his eyes firming up.

"It's only right that you should go, but do you know where she is now?" Nan Gong Wan asked.

"It's simple, just follow the swarm of insects," Han Li said, looking at the dense crowd of insects in the distance.

"You're still so quick-witted, and it's said that the scene of her breakthrough will be even more magnificent," Nan Gong Wan said with a hint of expectation.

"We shouldn't delay, let's go," Han Li said, taking Nan Gong Wan's hand and flashing onto the back of the Jin Tong Xian.

He then waved his hand to dispel the time domain, and the flow of time in the surrounding space immediately resumed, with the swarm of insects rushing past, flying towards the other end of the sea domain.

...

In a certain location in the extraterritorial space, a vast and profound void was filled with spatial storms, with occasional collisions between them, emitting bursts of brilliant light.

A massive spatial storm was hovering at the edge of a gigantic black cloud, which seemed to be alive, expanding and contracting, with clouds of gas churning inside, emitting beams of light that shot out in all directions.

This massive black cloud was the condensed form of the extraterritorial Heavenly Devil, and it was currently stuck to the spatial storm, unwilling to move forward.

In the endless void tens of millions of miles away, a massive golden beetle was suspended, its body radiating flames of golden light, with a powerful aura emanating from within.

Any extraterritorial meteorites that approached would be instantly annihilated by this aura, even if they were still tens of millions of miles away.

At the same time, the void around the golden beetle was filled with spatial rifts, like windows opening in a dark room.

These rifts were of varying sizes, with the smallest being tens of meters and the largest being tens of thousands of meters, and they corresponded to various regions of the heavenly domains.

In these spatial rifts, countless spiritual insects were pouring in, rushing towards the extraterritorial space.

However, the extraterritorial void was not like other places, with an extraordinary spatial pressure that was not to be underestimated, and most of the spiritual insects that passed through the rifts were instantly annihilated, turning to dust.

Despite this, countless spiritual insects continued to charge forward, undaunted by death, and some of them even managed to resist the spatial pressure, reaching the golden beetle's side, where they were protected by its golden light.

Among these insects, there were some with extraordinary abilities, who could withstand the spatial pressure and reach the golden beetle's side, where they were absorbed into its body.

As more and more insects entered the extraterritorial space, the swarm of insects surrounding the golden beetle grew larger, and they were now like a belt, encircling its body.
