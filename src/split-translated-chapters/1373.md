The Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation saw the Demon Lord use the spatial law to seal the void, and his eyes slightly relaxed, his hands moving swiftly to continue weaving the spell.

As more and more gray lightning appeared, pouring into the gray lightning portal, the portal became increasingly dazzling, making everything around it seem dull and faded, as if only this door existed in the world.

In the center of the portal, countless lightning serpents and electric threads gathered and converged, controlled by an invisible force, turning in a certain direction to form a whirlpool.

Inside the whirlpool, countless chaotic lights danced and quickly formed a black, spatial tunnel.

Gu Huo's expression remained unchanged, and with a single hand gesture, his sleeve fluttered lightly.

His eyes suddenly shone with golden light, and his exposed skin, including his hands and neck, revealed a series of mysterious, cryptic patterns, connected to the patterns on his clothes, like a network of fine, golden blood vessels. The surface of his skin emitted a soft, golden glow that pulsed and flowed.

The strange thing was that these patterns also appeared on the wheelchair he sat in, connected to the patterns on his body.

Each time the golden light flashed, a ring of golden light would emerge from his body, spreading out in all directions from his seated position, growing fainter as it expanded.

In an instant, hundreds of thousands of golden lights radiated out, and from a distance, it seemed as if countless golden silhouettes of Gu Huo were flying out.

These golden lights contained an extremely powerful temporal law, but it was different from the temporal law Gu Huo had used before, and it seemed extremely violent.

As the golden lights merged with the surrounding silver lights, the space within a thousand miles became a mixture of gold and silver, with the two colors flashing back and forth, dazzling to behold.

The space, frozen by the silver light, violently trembled under the invasion of the golden lights, and finally, it collapsed, unleashing a storm of spatial winds.

The shattered void was like a crystal palace being crushed, transformed into countless silver crystal shards that flew in all directions, swept up by the spatial winds.

The Demon Lord was not surprised by the destruction of the spatial seal, and with a wave of his hand, a spatial law force erupted.

The power of the spatial storm created by the explosion immediately increased tenfold, engulfing the golden fist shadow, along with Gu Huo, in a massive spatial chaos.

This spatial chaos, amplified by the Demon Lord's spatial law, was filled with an immense spatial power, and the golden fist shadow was instantly submerged, then exploded with a loud "boom".

Gu Huo, caught off guard, was blown back a certain distance.

However, the golden light on his body surged, and he quickly stabilized his form, without a single injury.

At this moment, the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation had finished his spell, and with a wave of his hand, he shouted, "Open!"

The gray lightning portal, composed of countless gray lightning bolts, shone with an intense, dazzling light, and the whirlpool had filled the entire gate. But as the word "open" fell, the gray lights suddenly dispersed, and everything inside the portal became clear.

It was a gray, monotonous world, with a white sky, endless gray clouds, black earth, and mountains. Everything was a mix of black and white, giving a feeling of desolation and gloom.

On the black earth and mountains, countless gray figures stood, stretching to the horizon, a sea of gray-clothed cultivators.

Their numbers were staggering, rivaling the armies of the Demon Domain or the Wilderness Domain.

In terms of cultivation, these gray-clothed cultivators were also extraordinary, with many being elite, and some even being powerful, undead, gray-robed cultivators with Da Luo realm strength.

The Heaven's Court cultivators, seeing these gray-robed cultivators, were shocked and changed their expressions.

The gray clouds were filled with the gray realm's yuan qi, which clashed with the Heaven's Court's spiritual energy, producing a deafening, rumbling sound.

The Heaven's Court's spiritual energy and the gray realm's yuan qi were completely opposite, and when they collided, the spiritual energy near the Heaven's Court immediately became thin.

The cultivators of the Heaven's Court, who were engaged in fierce battles with the Demon Domain and the Wilderness Domain, slowed down their movements.

"Gray-robed cultivators!" The cultivators of the Heaven's Court, who were familiar with the gray-robed cultivators, immediately recognized their origins and shouted in surprise.

A flash of gray light from the portal, and three figures, emitting incredibly powerful fluctuations, emerged from the portal, revealing their true forms.

The first person was a middle-aged man with a pale face, sharp features, and a detached expression, who was none other than Yin Cheng.

The other two were a tall, imposing man with a black, metallic body, resembling a black, golden giant, who seemed to be from the Black Rope Domain.

The other person was wrapped in a gray cloak, making it impossible to see their face, with long, thin arms protruding from the cloak, covered in dark, wrinkled skin, like a corpse that had been submerged in water for years. They emitted a cold, eerie aura, making people feel extremely uncomfortable.

These two individuals were not inferior to Yin Cheng in terms of aura, and they were also clearly powerful, Da Luo realm cultivators.

As soon as they appeared, one of them raised his hand and pointed at the Heaven's Court cultivators.

Boom!
Countless gray boundary cultivators flew out, transforming into a gray tidal wave, blocking the group of frenzied killing cultivators, and engaging in a fierce battle.

The gray boundary's primordial energy was specifically designed to counter the heavenly and earthly spiritual energy, and the heavenly court cultivators' attacks were immediately hindered.

The gray boundary's army was led by dozens of corpse-gray celestials, entangling dozens of heavenly court cultivators.

Among these corpse-gray celestials, a considerable portion were those who had been killed by the heavenly court cultivators, and both sides knew each other's strengths and weaknesses. Despite the heavenly court cultivators' increased power due to the Dao God Seal, they were still entangled by the corpse-gray celestials.

The leader of the heavenly court cultivators was entangled, and their unstoppable attack was immediately halted.

The demonic domain's army and the barbaric domain's people immediately regrouped and charged towards the heavenly court cultivators, surrounding them once again.

As the situation stabilized, the Demon Lord, Chi Rong, and others let out a sigh of relief.

The Wheel of Reincarnation's master remained calm and composed, unaffected by the situation, and continued to gaze at Guo or Jin.

Li Yuanji, who had been standing with his eyes closed, suddenly opened them, and a golden light burst forth from his body, suppressing the nine-colored light on his body.

He took advantage of the opportunity to spit out a small, five-colored bottle, which radiated golden, red, blue, green, and yellow light, identical to the small bottle that Jiao San and others had taken from the Nine Yuan Observatory.

As soon as the five-colored bottle left Li Yuanji's mouth, its light intensified, and a five-colored light burst forth from its mouth, enveloping Li Yuanji's body.

The five-colored light contained the five elements of gold, wood, water, fire, and earth, which not only didn't conflict with each other but also harmonized with the Dao God Seal, hinting at a tendency to merge into one.

The small bottle rotated rapidly, emitting a powerful and unmatched suction force.

The nine-colored light on Li Yuanji's body began to separate and enter the small bottle.

His face relaxed, and the golden light on his body intensified, as if countless golden needles were forcing the nine-colored light to leave his body.

In just a few breaths, Li Yuanji's nine-colored seal on his forehead shattered, and the nine-colored light on his body flew out, entering the five-colored bottle.

Guo or Jin's expression changed slightly as he witnessed this scene.

At this moment, three gray figures suddenly appeared beside the Wheel of Reincarnation's master, surrounding Guo or Jin once again.

Li Yuanji's eyes moved, and he immediately pointed at Chi Rong.

The five-colored bottle on his head flew out, landing on Chi Rong's head.

Li Yuanji had regained his divine abilities, and the power of the small bottle increased dramatically.

The five-colored bottle rapidly expanded, and a massive five-colored light burst forth, enveloping Chi Rong.

The Dao God Seal on Chi Rong's body began to separate, and after a few breaths, it shattered.

The two of them joined the others, surrounding Guo or Jin.

The seven Dao Ancestors joined forces, unleashing a pressure that could destroy the heavens and earth, enveloping Guo or Jin.

"Friend, Luo Dao friend, this person should be the soul-snatching Dao friend from the gray boundary, who has always been solitary and independent. You've managed to bring them over, Guo, I must admit I'm impressed," Guo or Jin said, his eyes scanning the three gray figures before falling on the Wheel of Reincarnation's master.

"It's not surprising, knowing your schemes, anyone would understand what to do. You're to blame for your own greed, trying to dominate the entire world," the Wheel of Reincarnation's master replied calmly.

His voice was not loud, but it carried far.

Chen Ruyan, who was fighting against the demonic domain's four Dao Ancestors, noticed a hint of abnormality in her eyes and waved her hand.

Five waves of blue light shot out from her fingers, rapidly expanding and transforming into five massive waves that engulfed the entire sky, crashing down on the demonic woman and the giant beast transformed from the white-robed fat woman.

The demonic woman's purple-black flowers contained a powerful corrosive poison, but they required close proximity to take effect. Against the massive waves, they had little effect, and upon contact, they were bent and swayed like water plants.

The woman's face remained calm, and she drew a purple-black long knife with intricate patterns, slashing at the waves.

A long, purple-black blade of light shot out, striking the waves.

The giant beast transformed from the white-robed fat woman opened its nine eyes, and nine black light columns shot out, merging into a massive black light column with swirling black lightning, emitting a terrifying hissing sound, and striking the waves.

In the midst of the deafening roar, the waves were split into two massive gaps, and the blade of light and black light column shot towards Chen Ruyan.

The sound of the waves was like thunder, and the blade of light and black light column approached Chen Ruyan with incredible speed.
