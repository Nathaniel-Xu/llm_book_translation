"How about this? If I can refine four or more Time Dao Dan, I'll ask you to sell me the Shui Yan Shi Wang Jing," Han Li said, his brow furrowed in thought.

"Dragon Five, I've already said that if you want the Shui Yan Shi Wang Jing, you must refine five Time Dao Dan. There's no other way, and if you continue to haggle, this transaction will end here," Yuan San said, his eyes cold and detached.

"Alright, I'll do it," Han Li sighed, resigned.

Yuan San's eyes softened slightly, and he waved his hand.

The transmission array in the middle of the trading interface in front of Han Li flashed, and a storage ring and a white jade slip appeared.

Han Li's eyes moved, and he took the ring and the jade slip, first inserting his divine sense into the jade slip.

The jade slip contained a Dao Dan recipe, which was completely different from the one he had refined before. The main material was a substance similar to Shui Yan Shi Wang Jing, and the other materials had also changed, but the combination of the materials was similar to the previous recipe.

Han Li let out a sigh of relief, knowing that as long as the combination of materials didn't change too much, his previous experience in refining Dao Dan would still be useful.

He then took the storage ring, and his divine sense entered it, finding ten sets of materials inside, all of which had abundant spiritual energy and no problems.

"I've received the materials, and I'll start refining the Dao Dan as soon as possible. Is there a time limit, Yuan San?" Han Li asked, looking at Yuan San.

"Ten years is enough," Yuan San said, before disappearing in a flash, seemingly having some opinions about Han Li.

Han Li smiled faintly, not minding Yuan San's attitude, and instead found his personality quite interesting. Such a person was indeed rare in the current immortal world.

This transaction was not easy, and it seemed that Yuan San had intentionally made it difficult, as if he didn't care about the outcome. But the price he offered was very satisfying, and Han Li had no choice but to try his best.

He took the jade slip again, closed his eyes, and began to analyze the recipe, simulating the refining process in his mind.

Half a year later, Han Li opened his eyes, letting out a gentle sigh.

During this time, he had studied the new Dao Dan recipe countless times, simulating the refining process in his mind until he was satisfied.

It was unavoidable, as this time's refining process was different from the previous one. Last time, he had prepared nine sets of materials, and as long as he succeeded once, it would be enough. This time, he only had ten sets of materials, but he had to succeed five times, which was much more difficult.

Fortunately, his current refining skills had improved a lot compared to the previous time, and his cultivation was far beyond what it was before. Whether it was his control over flames or his perception, he was much stronger than before, and the possibility of success was quite high.

Han Li floated out of the flower branch space, entered the outer room, and waved his hand to remove the entrance.

He then raised his hand, and the Jing Yue Tongzi flew out from his body, landing in the room.

"You stay here and guard the caravan. If any strong enemies attack, you'll take care of them and ensure the caravan's safety," Han Li said to Jing Yue Tongzi.

Jing Yue Tongzi had become more intelligent and nodded immediately, even patting his chest as if to guarantee that he would protect the caravan.

Han Li praised Jing Yue Tongzi a few times, then pinched his fingers, and his body turned into a virtual shadow, flying out of the room without disturbing anyone outside.

Refining Dao Dan would trigger a Dan Jie, which couldn't be concealed, and he didn't want the two tribes to see it.

Han Li left the caravan, quickly found a quiet and secluded mountain peak, dug out a simple cave, and set up a few layers of restrictions around it.

...

A vast black cloud was flying through the sky in the Wilderness Domain, filled with the Great Wilderness Demon Clan's army. There were tiger-like demons, leopard-like demons, lion demons, elephant demons, and bear demons, with thousands of different kinds of demons, at least tens of thousands in total.

Among the demons, the tiger-like demons were the most numerous, making up half of the total, and the other demons seemed to be afraid of them.

In the center of the black cloud, there was a black throne, upon which sat a young man with a sinister face and white hair. He didn't have any of the Great Wilderness Demon Clan's characteristics, and looked almost identical to a human cultivator.

Around him stood seven or eight powerful demons, each with a cultivation level that had reached the Taiyi Peak.

"Young Master, this time, the old Clan Leader has let you replace him in attending the Blood Sacrifice Conference. It seems that he has already recognized you as the next Clan Leader of our Zhu Wu Clan," a giant of a man with a black body, iron-like skin, and a voice like thunder said, his face filled with a flattering smile.

The giant had yellow tiger stripes on his face, and was clearly a tiger demon.

"Among Father's ten or so children, I have the most concentrated Zhu Wu bloodline, so of course, I should inherit the Clan Leader position. Father has been dragging his feet for so long, it's simply laughable," the white-haired young man said, his face revealing a hint of cruelty.

"Perhaps the Clan Leader has other considerations..." the tiger-striped giant said, his face changing slightly.

"Hmph! What other considerations could there be? It's just my good brothers and sisters who are always whispering in Father's ear, that's why he's been hesitating for so long. If not for the Heaven's pressure, I wouldn't have been able to advance to the Da Luo Realm, and he would have continued to drag his feet!" the white-haired young man said coldly.
The young master said, but you have already successfully advanced to the Great Luo, and others cannot be compared to you, so you can rest assured. A lion-type demon beast beside him spoke up.

"Rest assured? It's not time yet, my brothers and sisters have many elders of our tribe standing behind them, either openly or secretly, and we must not be careless." The white-haired youth shook his head.

"The young master is right." The tiger-striped giant nodded.

"Whatever they do, once I fully awaken the Zhōu Zhōu bloodline at the Blood Sacrifice Conference, no one will dare to question my succession to the position of tribe leader." The white-haired youth sneered.

"The young master is far-sighted and wise, we are deeply impressed." The nearby demons all flattered in unison.

The white-haired youth's face showed a hint of a smile as he was being flattered by his subordinates, but his expression suddenly changed as he looked in a certain direction.

The others quickly noticed something and also looked in that direction.

A dazzling golden light appeared at the horizon, swirling and dancing ceaselessly, making the sky in that area suddenly become heavy and oppressive.

A strong fluctuation of the law of the universe emanated from it, rolling and transmitting over, accompanied by a thunderous roar, like the sound of a thousand horses galloping.

"What a powerful phenomenon, what is it? Who is breaking through the boundary?" A white elephant demon asked in a trembling voice.

"This is not a breakthrough, someone is refining a Dao Dan, and it's a time Dao Dan. I was worried that I wouldn't have any gifts to present to the True Spirit King, but now it seems that someone has sent me a pillow!" The white-haired youth's eyes lit up, and he let out a long whistle before transforming into a white light that shot out from the black clouds, rushing towards the golden light.

The white-haired youth's speed was incredible, and he soon arrived at the location, but instead of revealing himself, he hid in a white cloud.

The sky in that area was covered by a thick layer of golden clouds, which were rolling and churning.

A massive fluctuation of the law of the universe emanated from the golden clouds, causing the spiritual energy of the heaven and earth within a hundred million miles to surge violently.

The sky was dyed golden, but it gave people a feeling of heaviness, and the mountains below were trembling, as if they couldn't bear the pressure.

A loud rumbling sound echoed!

A giant golden whirlpool formed in the clouds, and a dazzling golden light shot out, emitting a law of time that could tear apart the heavens and earth, striking a small mountain below.

The mountain was surrounded by a brilliant light, and a powerful restriction was transmitted from it.

"A cultivator from the immortal realm!" The white-haired youth's face was instantly covered with a layer of killing intent, and his eyes flashed with a cold light, revealing his desire to kill.

However, he quickly took a deep breath and suppressed the killing intent in his eyes.

At that moment, a mountain peak suddenly appeared above the small mountain, and its surface was covered with golden symbols that shone brightly.

It was the Yuán Hé Wǔ Jí Mountain!

The golden light that had been shot down from the sky struck the mountain, causing a deafening explosion.

The dark golden mountain peak only shook slightly, and the golden symbols on its surface flashed brightly, releasing a massive amount of golden light that countered the attack.

However, the attack was not over, and another golden light shot down from the sky, this time even more powerful than the first.

The dark golden mountain peak rotated rapidly, releasing even more golden light that countered the attack.

Again, a loud rumbling sound echoed!

The golden light that had been shot down was dispersed, and the dark golden mountain peak shook violently, but it managed to withstand the attack.

Before the mountain peak could recover, another golden light shot down from the sky, this time even more powerful than the previous two.

The dark golden mountain peak was severely shaken, and its golden symbols flashed brightly as it countered the attack.

The golden light that had been shot down was dispersed, and the dark golden mountain peak shook violently, but it managed to withstand the attack.

"Wow, what a powerful Dan treasure! It seems that it can withstand Dan tribulations of the fifth and sixth ranks." The white-haired youth's eyes lit up, and a hint of greed flashed across his face.
