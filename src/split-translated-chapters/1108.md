Han Li's expression turned solemn, his hands swiftly forming a hand seal, and a low shout escaped his lips.

As he pointed forward, the countless sword auras and sword lights erupted forth, covering the thousands of stone swords and engulfing them.

"Clang clang clang..."

In the midst of the intense clanging sounds, the sword lights and shadows shot out by the Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword rapidly dissipated, and it took dozens of swords to neutralize a single stone sword, and even then, it was only the sword light that was neutralized.

However, the Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword's sword lights were even more dense, and their numbers far surpassed the stone swords, allowing them to temporarily hold their ground.

Han Li's expression turned stern, his hands unceasingly forming hand seals, controlling the Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword as it continuously pressed forward, forming a vast sword light net that forced the stone swords to retreat.

As the sword lights continued to dissipate, the Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword's sword lights had already diminished by 90%, and the stone swords' sword lights had also been depleted, leaving only less than 30 swords remaining.

The collision between the two sides was still intense, the surging sword lights illuminating the air, and the thunderous roars shook the heavens.

Han Li gritted his teeth, his forehead gradually sweating with beads of sweat.

He suddenly let out a low shout, his body's immortal energy surging forth like a tidal wave, and the remaining Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword erupted forth at the same time.

All the flying swords' surfaces were surrounded by golden light, and countless golden electric lights flashed, instantly destroying more than half of the remaining stone swords, leaving only the original eight stone swords, which still hung in the air, pointing at Han Li.

At the same time, the Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword's own sword lights had also dissipated, leaving only over 80 swords remaining.

Han Li's heart slightly calmed, and he took a large step forward, about to ascend to the altar.

But just as he did, a sudden change occurred!

The yellow goose egg stones embedded on the edge of the altar suddenly shone brightly, and a burst of light flashed.

The eight stone swords in mid-air suddenly shook, as if they had regained a powerful force, and their bodies burst forth with bright yellow light, shooting out rapidly, and directly shredding the remaining Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword's sword lights.

Thirty-six flying swords were heavily struck, and still managed to burst forth with a dazzling electric light, blocking seven of the stone swords, but ultimately, one stone sword slipped through, shooting towards Han Li's chest, mere inches from his vital point.

At the critical moment, Han Li suddenly reversed the rotation of his body's true word wheel, and his body rapidly shifted to the side, the stone sword grazing his ribcage and flying out, tearing open his waistband.

Han Li's heart was filled with lingering fear, and he hastily raised his hand to summon a flying sword, retreating a step back.

At this moment, a loud "crack" echoed, and the goose egg stones embedded on the edge of the altar suddenly dimmed, and then exploded, shattering into pieces.

The remaining seven flying swords hovering in mid-air seemed to have lost their spiritual energy, and they fell to the ground with a loud clatter.

Han Li saw this and knew that the stone's contained law energy had been depleted after countless years, and his mind finally relaxed slightly, taking a step forward to ascend to the altar.

However, he had only taken one step when his expression suddenly changed, and he hastily looked down at his waist.

He saw that the torn fabric of his robes had bloodstains seeping out, but the wound was not deep, only a scratch.

But when Han Li lifted his robes to examine the wound, he was shocked to discover that the wound was grayish-white, and when he touched it, it felt like rock, cold and hard.

He thought for a moment, and then realized that the flying sword's earth attribute law energy must have caused his wound to petrify.

Fortunately, the wound was not deep, and the sword had not pierced his body, so the petrified area was only about an inch in diameter.

After thinking for a moment, Han Li used his fingers to make a cutting motion, and cut off the petrified skin, and the newly formed wound began to heal on its own.

After taking care of the wound, he gathered up the remaining Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword, and was about to ascend to the altar when he heard a distant rumbling sound, as if someone had also found the location of the array's core and was rushing towards him.

He didn't hesitate, and took a step onto the altar, his hands surrounded by a blue glow, and he grasped the octagonal jade disk, pulling it out of the altar.

Han Li held the jade disk, his mind stirring, and he began to examine it.

After a moment, his eyes widened in surprise, and a hint of excitement flashed across his face, and he realized that the jade disk was actually the legendary Tian Tian Sword Array chart, said to have been taken out of the Tong Tian Sword Sect by the Ta Sui Immortal.

The complexity and intricacy of the sword array chart far exceeded his imagination.

He had only glanced at it briefly, and he knew that it was a rare and valuable treasure, and he quickly and carefully put it away.

The next moment, a loud "boom" echoed from the sky.

Han Li instinctively looked up, and saw that the Heaven Gate hovering in the sky was slowly closing, its surroundings shrouded in a yellow mist, and the void becoming increasingly indistinct.
The yellow giant sword that had been falling earlier had disappeared, and the entire array had been completely dissolved.

The oppressive force that had been present for a long time was slowly disappearing, and the chaotic fog that had gathered around was temporarily not dissipating, but the subtle threads of earth attribute laws that were hidden within it could no longer be sensed.

Han Li slowly stepped down from the altar, flipped his hand, and took out a pill.

Just as he was about to take it, he heard a voice behind him: "Hehe, Han fellow, it's been a tough job breaking the array..."

Han Li turned his head to see Lei Yuze walking towards him with a smile.

As he approached, he saw the eight stone swords scattered on the ground, and with a wave of his sleeve, he calmly collected them one by one.

"If it weren't for everyone's help in entering the array, I wouldn't have been able to achieve this," Han Li said with a smile.

"Lei fellow, don't be too modest, the first credit for breaking the array belongs to you," Lei Yuze continued.

"Lei fellow, don't flatter me, even if I had a thick face, I wouldn't be able to bear it," Han Li said with a wave of his hand.

Lei Yuze's expression flashed with a hint of hesitation, and after a moment's thought, he spoke up: "Han fellow, I have something to ask of you, please grant me this favor."

"What is it, Lei fellow? Just speak," Han Li said, pretending not to know.

"At the time of breaking the array, you should have seen a sword array diagram, that is our Tongtian Sword Sect's lost treasure, I hope you can return it to its rightful owner. Of course, our Tongtian Sword Sect will also show the greatest sincerity and compensate you," Lei Yuze said with a bow.

Han Li's expression changed, and he furrowed his brow, looking surprised, and asked: "I've been trapped in the sword array since I entered, and I've only just managed to escape, but I didn't see any array diagram."

"Lei fellow, this sword array may be of high rank, but to you, it's just a powerful sword array, but to our sect, it has a special significance. If you can generously return it, I'm willing to give you a five-grade immortal artifact as a gift, and also invite you to be our Tongtian Sword Sect's unnamed benefactor, enjoying the treatment of an inner sect elder," Lei Yuze said, seemingly having anticipated this, his expression unchanged.

Such a reward would be a great treasure for anyone, and the offer of becoming a benefactor of the Tongtian Sword Sect was indeed a great show of sincerity, allowing Han Li to not be recorded in the ancestral hall, not having to be responsible for sect affairs, and not exposing his whereabouts, while also receiving a steady supply of elder's offerings.

However, for Han Li, these were all like useless chicken ribs, and after this, he wouldn't be able to stay in the Jin Yuan Immortal Realm, and he himself didn't know where he would go next.

Most importantly, the Tongtian Sword Array was really to his liking, and if he could use his Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword to deploy it, it would be a great help to him.

"Lei fellow's kindness is appreciated, but I really don't know what you're talking about, even if I coveted the benefits you mentioned, I couldn't possibly deceive you," Han Li said with a regretful expression.

"Lei fellow, did you really not see the array diagram on this altar?" Lei Yuze asked, his brow furrowed.

At the same time, he had doubts in his heart, could it be that it wasn't really here?

"There was nothing on this altar except for the eight stone swords, and I didn't even have time to check, before you took them away," Han Li said with a bitter smile.

Lei Yuze's expression was slightly frozen, and his eyes stared intently at Han Li, as if trying to see something unusual.

But Han Li was calm and composed, without any flaws.

"Lei fellow, if there's nothing else, let's take a look at the Su Yue Temple and see if there are any more restrictions," Han Li said, changing the subject.

Lei Yuze's brow furrowed, and he nodded after a moment's thought, then suddenly pinched his fingers together, and a chanting voice came from his mouth.

As the voice sounded, the white jade plate on his waist suddenly lit up, and a complex symbol appeared on it.

Han Li had already turned around, and suddenly felt a strange fluctuation coming from behind him, and when he looked down, he saw that the storage ring on his hand was flashing with a bright light.

The eight-sided jade plate was hidden in the storage ring.

"Lei fellow, you really don't want to return it?" Lei Yuze's voice came from behind him.

"Treasures in the secret realm, each person relies on their own abilities. I didn't fight you for those stone swords earlier, and that's already a show of goodwill, Lei fellow, why are you being so aggressive? If you're really not willing to give up, you can try to take it by force, I don't mind taking those stone swords back," Han Li said coldly, without turning his head.

After speaking, he walked through the square, and climbed up the stone steps of the grand temple, step by step.

Lei Yuze stood still, his expression solemn, and a complex expression flashed in his eyes.

At this time, the yellow clouds in the sky were slowly dissipating, and the figures of the other people were emerging from the fog, and they began to hurry towards this direction.

Lei Yuze glanced at Qi Mozi leading a group of demons, and sighed softly, suppressing the anger in his heart.

After all, his desire for the sword array diagram was born out of selfishness, and for him, there were more important things to attend to in the grand temple.

Han Li walked up the steps, his eyes fixed on the temple, and his heart was filled with a sense of excitement and trepidation.

What secrets lay hidden in the Su Yue Temple? He was about to find out.
