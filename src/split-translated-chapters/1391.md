Just as everyone was shocked by Han Li's immense divine power, a sudden change occurred!

Dozens of golden whirlpools suddenly merged into one, forming a massive whirlpool that covered the sky and sun, and then rapidly descended upon the crowd.

Li Yuanji and the others' faces changed greatly, and they immediately tried to activate the laws to resist, but a massive and unmatched time law had already enveloped everyone, rendering their bodies and the laws within them immobile, unable to move or react, and could only watch in horror.

However, the massive golden whirlpool suddenly flashed and dispersed like bubbles.

The time law that had restrained the crowd also disappeared in an instant.

The sky cleared up again, and the shattered void nearby quickly recovered to its original state, making everything seem like a dream.

But the people present couldn't consider what had just happened as a mere dream.

The golden whirlpool's immense time law, which had crushed all fear and might, had left a deep impression on their minds, and even on their souls.

That seemed to be the most fundamental Heavenly Way!

Han Li's casual display of divine power had already surpassed that of the past or present.

They believed that if they had shown even a hint of disobedience, they would have been ruthlessly crushed by the Heavenly Way, leaving not even a single shred of residue behind.

Li Yuanji and the other Dao Ancestors looked at Han Li with a deep sense of reverence.

"You all should leave with your respective people." Han Li spoke again, his tone devoid of joy or sorrow.

The white-robed fat woman's face relaxed, and she bowed deeply to Han Li, then led the terrified people from the Demon Domain away, disappearing into the distance.

The dry corpse man didn't dare say anything, and followed the people from the Demon Domain in leaving.

"Obeying your orders." Bai Ze and the bald giant also bowed to Han Li, then led the remaining people from the Barbarian Domain away.

Liu Linger looked at Han Li, but didn't go over to speak to him.

Although they were only a hundred yards apart, it seemed like there was a massive chasm between them.

"Brother, wait for me, I'll continue to work hard, and one day I'll openly walk to your side." Liu Linger turned and left with Bai Ze and the others, silently saying this to herself.

Bai Yun Dao Ancestor led his subordinates to Han Li's side.

"Thank you, Han Daoist, for your timely assistance." Bai Yun Dao Ancestor bowed, and the other people from the Heavenly Court also bowed.

"It's not that I helped you, but rather I didn't want to increase the slaughter." Han Li calmly replied.

"No matter what, Han Daoist's favor today will be remembered in my heart, and if you have any orders in the future, I'll definitely do my best to assist you, to repay today's kindness." Bai Yun Dao Ancestor sincerely said, then led the remaining people from the Heavenly Court away.

"Why aren't you leaving? Is there something else you want to do?" Han Li looked at Li Yuanji, Chi Feng, and Chen Ruoyan, and said.

"Han Daoist has saved the True Immortal Realm from disaster, and has great merit towards the people of the world, and since Guo or Jin has passed away, the position of Heavenly Court's ruler is vacant, I wonder if Han Daoist is interested in taking it? We three can assist you with all our might." Li Yuanji and the others looked at each other, hesitated for a moment, then spoke.

Han Li's eyebrows moved, and he knew that he had given the three of them the wrong impression by saving Bai Yun Dao Ancestor.

"I don't have any desire for power, don't misunderstand." Han Li waved his hand, and firmly said.

Li Yuanji and the others were taken aback, and stood there in shock.

"This great calamity has caused the downfall of many Dao Ancestors in the True Immortal Realm, and the various immortal domains will probably be in chaos, you three are all original Dao Ancestors, and are the focus of attention, quickly return to your respective sects and stabilize the situation." Han Li said.

Li Yuanji and the others heard this, looked at each other, and saw the feeling of relief in each other's eyes, and unanimously agreed, then turned and flew away.

Li Yuanji's figure had just risen into the air, when he suddenly seemed to sense something, and turned back to see Han Li nodding at him from afar, and he was slightly taken aback, then nodded back at Han Li, before turning and flying away as a streak of light.

Soon, only Han Li was left in the sky.

"Han Daoist, why did you drive those people away so hastily?" Jin Tong walked over, her big eyes moving as she asked.

Han Li didn't speak, and waved his hand, leading Jin Tong towards the high altitude, and soon arrived at the outer realm.

He flew deeper into the outer realm, and stopped after a while, his face revealing a hint of pain.

"What are you doing?" Jin Tong asked urgently.

Han Li's head was surrounded by a loud rumbling, and a golden light shot out, enveloping his body.

His body seemed to be melting within the golden light.

After a while, the rumbling stopped, and the golden light disappeared, and Han Li's body returned to normal.

"Has the Heavenly Way started to erode your body?" Jin Tong's face was solemn.

"I used too much law energy in the battle with Guo or Jin, and it's possible that the next time I clash with someone, I'll be directly merged with the Heavenly Way." Han Li sighed.

"How can it be so fast?" Jin Tong was shocked.

She had become a Dao Ancestor some time ago, and had engaged in several battles with people, but the Heavenly Way's erosion was not severe yet.

"Do you have any way to counter this?" Jin Tong asked, putting aside her previous question.

Han Li's eyebrows were tightly furrowed, and he didn't speak.

He had just become a Dao Ancestor, and didn't have Guo or Jin's deep understanding of the Heavenly Way's erosion, nor did he have a way to create a divine seal like Guo or Jin.

Guo or Jin was now nothing but a corpse, and the entire Middle Earth Immortal Domain had been reduced to ashes, making it impossible to find any records of Guo or Jin's methods to avoid being merged with the Heavenly Way.

"Han youngster, I have a way to help you avoid the Heavenly Way's erosion." The voice of the Bottle Spirit suddenly rang out.
Here is the translated text:

"Senior Ping Ling, do you have any methods?" Han Li asked through voice transmission.

"After advancing to the level of Dao Ancestor, one will gradually be eroded by the Heavenly Dao, and this phenomenon is irreversible and unstoppable. Even if Guo or Jin created the so-called Dao God Seal, it only slightly delays the erosion of the Heavenly Dao, treating the symptoms but not the root cause." Ping Ling snorted and said with disdain.

"Senior, do you have a foolproof method?" Han Li's eyes lit up slightly.

"It's fortunate that you have the Palm of Heaven vessel. This vessel was born from the chaos and can contain any law of the universe. If you truly want to escape the erosion of the Heavenly Dao, you must pour the Dao Ancestor's source law into the vessel. This will cause your cultivation to drop back to the Great Luo Realm, naturally escaping the erosion of the Heavenly Dao. However, the Palm of Heaven vessel previously contained the chaos law, and now it will contain your time law, which may exceed the vessel's limits." Ping Ling said.

"What will happen if it exceeds the limits?" Han Li's heart tightened, and he asked urgently through voice transmission.

"What will happen if it exceeds the limits? It will simply dissipate... In other words, if you use this method, you will forever lose the Palm of Heaven vessel. Consider carefully whether to use this method." Ping Ling's voice was devoid of emotion.

Han Li heard these words and stood silently, his face changing between light and dark.

He had already killed Guo or Jin, the first person of the Heavenly Court, and taken his place as the Time Dao Ancestor. On the path of pursuing the Great Dao, it seemed that there were no longer any obstacles.

As long as he was willing, he would be the true number one person in the True Immortal Realm, and all the domains of the True Immortal Realm, as well as countless lower realms, would be under his control.

He seemed to have reached the point of being as eternal as the heavens and earth.

Wasn't this the goal he had set for himself when he first entered the Immortal Realm?

Behind all of this was the accumulation of countless years of careful planning, countless opportunities, and the sacrifices of countless people...

But the scenes of Bone Emperor and Guo or Jin being consumed by the Heavenly Dao after using the law of the universe flashed through his mind.

All of this intertwined with his youthful ambitions, tugging at his heart.

Jin Tong did not hear Han Li and Ping Ling's voice transmission and saw Han Li's serious expression, thinking that he was considering his strategy, so he stood quietly beside him, not interrupting.

After a long time, Han Li raised his eyes and slowly opened his mouth to say:

"Thank you, Senior Ping Ling, for pointing out the way. I am willing to give up the Palm of Heaven vessel, please help me disperse the Dao Ancestor's source law within me."

"Your time law may stir up again at any moment, so we must not delay. Let us begin." Ping Ling's voice was slightly joyful, but immediately returned to normal.

A green light flashed, and the Palm of Heaven vessel flew down to Han Li's eyes, growing to the size of a washbasin.

Han Li saw this scene, and his eyebrows furrowed slightly as he swept his sleeve.

A silver light gate appeared beside him, and Nan Gong Wan's figure flew out from it.

"Wan'er, Jin Tong, I have some matters to attend to. Please retreat to a distance." Han Li said calmly.

Jin Tong was taken aback but did not ask questions, leading Nan Gong Wan to fly back.

Nan Gong Wan had been paying attention to the outside situation from the flower branch space.

She looked at Han Li, and her heart had a premonition that he was about to make a shocking decision. Although she was anxious, she did not ask any questions due to her trust in Han Li.

Han Li single-handedly pinched a seal, pressing it onto the Palm of Heaven vessel, and the enormous time law within him poured out, entering the vessel.

The Palm of Heaven vessel radiated extremely bright green light, and a dark green light cluster appeared within, rolling turbulently like thunderclouds.

The vessel seemed to contain a boundless deep sea, and no matter how much time law was poured in, it was easily contained without any obstruction.

Han Li sensed this situation, and his eyebrows rose slightly as he increased the flow of time law into the vessel. The green light emitted by the vessel also intensified.

At this moment, the dark green light cluster within the vessel suddenly rolled violently, and a thick, dark green light beam shot out from the vessel's mouth, entering the void.

The nearby void immediately rolled, and a golden time-space tunnel appeared, swallowing Han Li and the Palm of Heaven vessel.

Jin Tong saw this scene, and his face changed slightly as he quickly dodged to the side.

"Nan Gong Dao friend, Han Dao friend has vast divine abilities, and he will certainly overcome this problem. Don't worry." Jin Tong said to Nan Gong Wan.

"I'm not worried. Since Husband asked us to wait here, we'll wait." Nan Gong Wan smiled and said, her expression calm.

Jin Tong saw Nan Gong Wan's expression and secretly admired her.

Han Li was within the time-space tunnel, surrounded by endless time-space energy that was tearing at him. However, the Palm of Heaven vessel was currently radiating a gentle green light, easily isolating the surrounding time-space energy.

"What's going on?"

Han Li had traversed time-space many times, but this time, the feeling seemed different.

"Your time law has stimulated the Palm of Heaven vessel's time-space traversal divine ability. Don't worry about it, the next step is the most crucial. I will activate the Palm of Heaven vessel's power and begin to absorb your source Dao Ancestor law. You must not be distracted!" Ping Ling's voice came, extremely serious.

"Okay." Han Li's eyes flashed with a hint of light, and he nodded, fully activating the time law within him.

A golden light that was even more dazzling than the sun burst forth from his palm, containing an incredibly dense time law that merged into the vessel.

The Palm of Heaven vessel's surface flashed with a golden mark, extremely clear, like a crack.

Han Li's aura immediately weakened, but the Heavenly Dao's threat above his head seemed to relax slightly.

He looked up, and his eyes lit up with excitement as he continued to stimulate the source law within him, pouring it into the vessel.

As the golden light continued to flow from his palm, entering the vessel, the golden marks on the vessel's surface increased, and Han Li's aura rapidly decreased.
