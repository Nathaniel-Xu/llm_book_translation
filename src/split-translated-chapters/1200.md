Han Li's eyes lit up slightly as he saw the black giant claw, and he straightened his body.

The nearby Ti Huan stared intently at the black giant claw, her eyes flashing with an otherworldly glow, her slender body tense.

This was one of the two divine artifacts that Ti Huan had been seeking.

The other people in the auction hall exclaimed in surprise and admiration, discussing the artifact among themselves.

The fat old man made a hand seal, and a burst of spiritual energy flashed into the black giant claw. The artifact's surface was surrounded by a swirling black aura, and dense black talismans flew out, releasing a powerful yin wind.

Although the auction hall was surrounded by restrictive spells, the chill of the yin wind still swept through the entire hall, causing some of the weaker cultivators to shiver.

As the old man chanted, the black giant claw suddenly grew larger, transforming into a house-sized claw that grasped a nearby black stone pillar. The pillar was over a hundred feet tall and emitted a thick, metallic glow.

According to the Dayan Pavilion's custom, any attack-type divine artifact being auctioned had to be demonstrated, so that the customers could better understand its power. The black stone pillar was used for this purpose, having been specially refined to be extremely durable.

Several divine artifacts had already been demonstrated on the pillar, and it was now covered in dents and scratches, but still intact.

With a light "pu" sound, the black stone pillar shattered into over a dozen pieces, its surface showing signs of corrosion and melting. A wave of green smoke rose from the broken pillar.

The crowd gasped in shock.

Ti Huan's eyes flashed with an otherworldly glow, and she almost couldn't contain her excitement.

Han Li's brow furrowed, however, as he realized that this divine artifact's power was far beyond anything he had seen before.

Considering the prices of the previous divine artifacts, this one would likely be extremely expensive.

He had only five million spirit stones, which would be enough to buy this artifact, but he would have trouble affording the next ones.

"This old man's cultivation is not based on the yin ghost laws, so I can only bring out less than 10% of its power. If someone with the corresponding laws were to use this artifact, its power would be unimaginable. Enough boasting, let's start the bidding. The starting price is eight million spirit stones, and each bid must be at least five hundred thousand spirit stones more than the previous one." The fat old man announced the start of the bidding.

"Eight million six hundred thousand!"

"Nine million two hundred thousand!"

"One million!"

...

Perhaps the demonstration of the divine artifact's power had been too impressive, but despite the rarity of cultivators who practiced the yin ghost laws, there were still many people bidding. Han Li hadn't even had a chance to bid yet, and the price had already risen to one million spirit stones.

He didn't participate in the bidding yet, as the competition was still fierce, and he didn't want to get caught up in it.

Since he was determined to get the artifact, he would bid at the end.

Ti Huan glanced at Han Li, seemingly wanting to say something but hesitating.

After a moment, when the price had risen to one million five hundred thousand spirit stones, the number of bidders had dwindled.

"One million six hundred thousand!" Han Li pointed to a blue jade tablet on the table, and a blue glow appeared on its surface as he bid.

"One million six hundred fifty thousand!" A voice came from a nearby VIP room, belonging to an elderly cultivator.

Han Li turned to look at the room, his eyes flashing with a purple-black glow.

The opposing VIP room was surrounded by powerful restrictive spells, but they couldn't block Han Li's Nine Yin Magic Eyes.

Han Li had previously opened up most of his body's spiritual apertures in the Demon Blood Gate, and his eyes had also undergone a transformation, allowing him to see through the spells.

The Nine Yin Magic Eyes had initially been surrounded by a purple glow, but as Han Li's cultivation deepened, the glow had grown stronger.

However, when the technique reached a higher level, the purple glow would fade, and the eyes would turn black, allowing the cultivator to see through the nine yin.

Han Li's current Nine Yin Magic Eyes were close to reaching this level.

The elderly cultivator in the opposing VIP room was a mid-Deity Transformation cultivator, surrounded by a cold aura. He held a white staff that seemed to be made of human bone, and his expression was tense.

The elderly cultivator was unaware of Han Li's probing, and his face showed signs of anxiety, as if he had reached his limit.

"Master, the man's spiritual aura is showing signs of anxiety and tension, it seems he has no more spirit stones to spare." Ti Huan's eyes were closed, and her body was surrounded by a faint black glow, as she spoke.

Han Li glanced at Ti Huan in surprise, then bid again.

"One million eight hundred thousand!" He added one hundred fifty thousand spirit stones to his bid.

The elderly cultivator's face twitched, and he let out a long sigh, putting down his staff and giving up.

The other bidders in the hall also fell silent, as the price had already risen too high.

The divine artifact was indeed powerful, but it was no longer worth the price.

Han Li smiled slightly, and Ti Huan's face also lit up with a bright smile.

The fat old man was pleased with the high price, and was about to conclude the auction.

"One million nine hundred thousand!" But just as he was about to speak, a cold voice came from a distant VIP room.

Ti Huan's expression turned grim, and she gritted her teeth.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he turned to look at the room, his eyes flashing with a purple-black glow as he pierced through the walls and saw the situation inside.
Inside the private room, six people sat, all wearing black robes with hoods covering their faces.

The black robes emitted a flowing, water-like black glow that blocked Han Li's Nine Yin Demon Eye, which was a mysterious treasure.

The six people sat silently, making it unclear who was the one bidding.

"Hmm..." One of the black silhouettes, slightly smaller than the others, lifted its head, seemingly sensing Han Li's probing. It waved its hand, and a thick, red mist suddenly filled the private room, completely blocking Han Li's Nine Yin Demon Eye.

"Two hundred million!" Han Li's face sank, but he quickly recovered and spoke.

At the same time, he made a gesture to Ti Huan, who understood and closed her eyes. A dark, black glow emanated from her body as she probed the opponent's divine soul fluctuations.

"It's not working, the bidder is also cultivating a divine soul law, and they're skilled at hiding. I can't sense their divine soul fluctuations." Ti Huan opened her eyes, looking dejected.

Han Li's heart sank upon hearing this.

"Two hundred and twenty million!" The cold voice seemed impatient, rapidly increasing the bid by twenty million to try and intimidate Han Li.

"Master, it's too expensive, let's just forget it." Ti Huan hesitated, poking Han Li with her finger, and whispered a warning.

However, her words were tinged with reluctance, obvious to anyone.

"Two hundred and fifty million!" Han Li gave Ti Huan a reassuring glance and bid again, not backing down.

The auction hall erupted into a commotion as people turned to look at Han Li's private room.

Han Li had already set up a restrictive light screen in the room, blocking the probing gazes of the surrounding people.

"Two hundred and seventy million!" The cold voice paused, then bid again.

"Three hundred million!" Han Li's face remained expressionless as he suddenly bid an incredibly high price.

In reality, he was also feeling a pang of pain, spending three hundred million spirit stones to purchase the Ghostly Phantom Claw was a bit too high. However, he had already promised Ti Huan that he would get the two treasures, no matter what.

Moreover, the Ghostly Phantom Claw was a rare and excellent treasure, matching Ti Huan's law attributes perfectly, so it wasn't a bad deal.

In the opposing private room, a tall, thin figure suddenly lifted its head, revealing a pair of eyes as cold as a vulture's. It gazed at Han Li's private room, its eyes flashing with a cold light.

After a moment, it let out a cold snort and didn't bid again.

The auctioneer, a fat old man, asked for the price three times, then finally announced the winner of the Ghostly Phantom Claw.

Han Li let out a sigh of relief, but his brow furrowed as he looked at the remaining two hundred million spirit stones in his possession.

The other treasure that Ti Huan coveted was not inferior to the Ghostly Phantom Claw, and its price would likely be high. Additionally, there were the items that Jing Yin wanted, so the spirit stones might not be enough.

He furrowed his brow, looking pensive.

Soon, the auction house sent someone to deliver the Ghostly Phantom Claw. The person who arrived was none other than Lan Mei.

Han Li paid the spirit stones, and Ti Huan eagerly waved her hand, releasing a black glow that enveloped the Ghostly Phantom Claw. She then began to cultivate and refine it.

"Lan Mei, does your auction house purchase treasures?" Han Li asked, ignoring Ti Huan.

"Of course, we do. What treasure does the elder want to sell?" Lan Mei's eyes lit up as she replied.

Han Li waved his hand, and over a dozen blue crystals the size of human heads appeared beside him. They pulsed with an intense, electric glow.

A powerful electric law erupted from the crystals, causing Lan Mei's body to shudder violently. Her face turned pale.

Han Li saw this and waved his hand, releasing a golden electric glow that covered the crystals, masking most of the electric law.

Lan Mei finally steadied herself, took a deep breath, and thanked Han Li.

"These are Thunderstone!" She carefully examined the crystals, her eyes wide with shock.

"Thunderstone is a high-grade material for electric laws, almost as valuable as Earth Emperor Crystal or Heavenly Gold Drill." Han Li's expression remained calm as he asked, "How much are you willing to pay for these?"

These Thunderstones were discovered by Han Li when he was collecting electric essence in the Five Elements Thunder Domain. They were extremely valuable.

"These Thunderstones are of the highest quality, each one worth over a million spirit stones. Such a large transaction, I'm not authorized to make. Please wait, I'll go ask the executive elder to come." Lan Mei apologized and quickly walked away.

Han Li didn't hurry, looking down at the auction hall below.

The auction had resumed, but the item being auctioned was not what he wanted.

He glanced at it, then turned his attention to the private room from earlier, his mind racing.

The six people in that room were all dressed in black, their faces hidden. If they were just scattered cultivators, they wouldn't need to be so secretive.

Could they be from the Nine Yin Sect, the Hundred Refinement Mountain, or the Golden Source Sect? What were they doing in Jin Ling City?

Han Li's mind suddenly had an inexplicable thought: could these people be connected to him?

As he thought this, his brow furrowed.
