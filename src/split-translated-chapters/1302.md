Han Li's heart sank, and he let out a long whistle. The golden light around him burst forth, and his spiritual domain instantly became several times denser.

The True Speech Treasure Wheel, the Time Severing Torch, the Time Purifying Vessel, the Illusory Time Hourglass, and the Eastern Yi Divine Tree – all five of these objects appeared and surrounded his body, rapidly rotating and emitting dazzling golden light.

The True Speech Treasure Wheel spun continuously, releasing a boundless golden light that illuminated the surroundings like a full moon.

The Time Severing Torch's flames danced and shot out in all directions, like a dense rain of fire.

A long, winding river of time flowed out of the Time Purifying Vessel, carrying a mighty force that rushed towards the surroundings.

The Illusory Time Hourglass let out a "puff" sound and transformed into a vast expanse of golden sand, supporting Han Li's body.

The Eastern Yi Divine Tree sprouted and grew rapidly, transforming into a dense forest that filled the surroundings.

Han Li's spiritual domain condensed into a solid, and the gray-white stone temple nearby underwent a great transformation, instantly becoming a real world.

In an instant, the five powerful time laws that had evolved from the five elements intertwined, instantly dispelling the strange laws emitted by the White Bone Giant Claw.

Han Li's face relaxed, and he poured all his strength into activating the Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique. His spiritual domain's power surged, but its range did not expand.

The larger the spiritual domain's range, the more its power would be dispersed. Facing the Ancestor, Han Li naturally would not make such a mistake.

The Bone Emperor's eyes flashed with soul fire, and he formed a seal with his hand. A bone-white light shot out, merging with the White Bone Giant Claw.

The White Bone Giant Claw emitted a brilliant light, and the two shattered bone fingers instantly restored themselves, resembling five giant blades that fiercely slashed at Han Li's spiritual domain.

With a "sizzling" sound, Han Li's spiritual domain was instantly torn apart, creating five massive fissures that almost split it into six parts.

However, the five time laws within his spiritual domain continued to flow rapidly, refusing to break. They tenaciously defended their position.

Just then, Jiao San finally completed his spell, forming a seal with his hand. A dark red light shot out from his fingertips, entering the dark red light shield surrounding Han Li.

The light shield rippled, opening a narrow passageway just large enough for one person to pass through.

Han Li saw this and reacted quickly, reversing the rotation of the True Speech Treasure Wheel. His body transformed into a series of residual shadows, instantly entering the dark red light shield.

His time spiritual domain suddenly shrunk to a size of several dozen meters, its dense time laws flowing rapidly and firmly covering the passageway, preventing others from entering.

Jiao San immediately formed a seal, closing the passageway on the light shield.

However, a bone-white light shot out like a bolt of lightning, tearing through the time laws within Han Li's spiritual domain and appearing before the passageway. It was a several-meter-long white bone spear.

The bone spear's surface flowed with countless twisted symbols, emitting a dense and intense aura of death. It rapidly rotated, its piercing power astonishing.

In the distance, the Bone Emperor raised his arm, making a throwing motion.

He then transformed into a residual shadow, flying towards Han Li.

Han Li's heart trembled with fear. If the Bone Emperor entered the light shield, everything would be over.

He let out a loud roar, and the time laws within his body surged out, merging with his spiritual domain.

The golden spiritual domain's fissures instantly healed, and the True Speech Treasure Wheel's light burst forth, becoming ten times brighter. The five time laws within his spiritual domain rumbled and flowed, making everything within the domain become hazy.

The bone spear stopped in its tracks, its light rapidly weakening, its aura fading.

"What kind of divine ability is this?"

At the same time, Han Li activated the Heavenly Extermination Imprisonment Technique, and his body's 1,799 acupoints burst forth with dazzling light.

At this critical moment, the twelve true spirit bloodlines within his body were simultaneously activated, operating recklessly and without restraint. He then punched the bone spear with all his might.

A loud "hum" sound echoed, and the twelve true spirit shadows appeared around Han Li's body, flickering before merging back into his body.

Han Li's body suddenly emitted a massive amount of dark black light, which rotated and transformed into a gigantic black vortex. A terrifying suction force emerged from the vortex, drawing in everything around him.

The surrounding space shook violently, and one after another, spatial passageways appeared, seemingly connecting countless planes.

A surge of pure yuan qi poured out from these passageways, containing various types of yuan qi. The most abundant was demonic qi, and there was also a type of yuan qi that originated from the gray-white palace's interior, which was exceptionally thick.

All the yuan qi converged towards Han Li, merging into his body.

A sound like shattering glass echoed from within Han Li's body, and a bright crystal light appeared on his forehead. At the center of the crystal light was a bright acupoint.

During his time in the Eight Wastes Mountain's secret realm, Han Li had opened 1,799 of the 1,800 acupoints in the Heavenly Extermination Imprisonment Technique, leaving only the last acupoint's barrier unusually firm and unbreakable.

At this moment, Han Li's life was at stake, and he operated the Heavenly Extermination Imprisonment Technique and the twelve true spirit bloodlines without restraint. The last acupoint finally broke through.

His body emitted a dazzling purple-black light, and he grew numerous purple-black scales. His body expanded to over a hundred times its original size, transforming into a massive purple-black giant.

The purple-black giant's head emitted a flashing purple-black light, and eleven more heads grew, each with a different expression – anger, joy, indifference, sorrow, and more. It seemed to encompass all the emotions in the world.

The giant's back let out a series of muffled sounds, and twenty-four arms emerged, each with a different hand gesture – some with fingers splayed, others grasping or waving.

These arms seemed to be capable of capturing and manipulating souls.
"A loud boom echoed, and a burst of purple-black light exploded from the giant demon's body, surging outward and causing the surrounding dark red light shield to tremble.

Everything happened in an instant.

Han Li was shocked by the changes in his body, and his heart was filled with joy, but his fist moved faster than his thoughts. He struck the bone spear with a single punch.

A massive, earth-shaking force descended, and a deafening boom shook the air. The bone spear exploded, turning into countless bone-white lights that scattered in all directions.

However, the shattered lights were swept up by the massive force, blasting out of the dark red light shield's channel.

The light shield's channel flashed with dark red light, and the light shield's entrance suddenly closed.

A figure appeared outside the light shield, and the Bone Emperor's shadow emerged, a step too late. A furious roar escaped his lips.

Jiao San's eyes widened, and he let out a sigh of relief, but his face suddenly turned pale. He spat out a mouthful of blood, and his body began to shake once more.

The previous spell had stirred up his injuries.

Han Li saw this and waved his hand, releasing a golden light that enveloped Jiao San's body, stabilizing his form. At the same time, a vast and pure spiritual energy flowed into Jiao San's body.

This energy was exceptionally effective against physical injuries, and Jiao San's wounds immediately recovered by more than half.

Her face lit up with joy, and she quickly formed a hand seal.

The dark red light shield flashed brightly, and its thickness increased significantly. A dark red magic array appeared on the light shield's surface once more.

Countless tiny dark red symbols erupted from the magic array, and a loud, crackling sound filled the air. Thick, dark red chains shot out from the magic array, wrapping around the Bone Emperor.

The Bone Emperor raised his hand, and a crescent-shaped, bone-white light appeared. Countless bone-white symbols danced within the light, their energy far surpassing that of the previous bone spear. The surrounding air was filled with an intense, turbulent energy.

The dark red chains were easily severed with a faint "crack" sound.

The crescent light vanished, only to reappear in front of the dark red light shield. The Bone Emperor struck down with a swift, slashing motion.

The light shield shook violently, its surface trembling wildly as it rapidly thinned.

Jiao San's face turned pale, and she desperately formed a hand seal to stabilize the light shield. However, the crescent light's power was too great, and Jiao San's injuries made it impossible for her to fully activate the surrounding magic array. The light shield continued to shake, its surface growing increasingly thin.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he formed a hand seal. A golden light shot out from his fingertips, releasing a powerful temporal law that merged with Jiao San's body.

Jiao San's body resonated with the temporal law, and the surrounding dark red light shield stabilized, completely withstanding the crescent light's attack.

At this moment, the severed chains suddenly sprang back to life, wrapping around the Bone Emperor with incredible agility. In an instant, they had bound him into a large, dark red bundle.

"Explode!"

The dark red light shield flashed brightly, and Jiao San's eyes gleamed with a fierce light. She let out a sharp cry.

A massive explosion shook the air, and the bundle of chains burst open, transforming into a dark red, blazing sun.

A fierce, turbulent energy erupted, creating a massive whirlwind that swept outward.

"Bone Emperor!" a distant, black-faced man exclaimed, his voice filled with shock.

The dark, ghostly figure beside him, whose body was occupied by the spirit, trembled slightly but remained silent.

Jiao San formed another hand seal, and the crescent light's attack created a massive, dark red vortex on the light shield's surface. A powerful, devouring energy emanated from the vortex, and the crescent light vanished into it.

After completing these actions, Jiao San's face relaxed, and she turned to Han Li, asking, "Thank you, Han... fellow cultivator, for your assistance... but how did you end up here? You were with these thieves just now; do you have some ulterior motive?"

"I am not allied with these people," Han Li replied.

As he spoke, he formed a hand seal, and his body flashed with purple-black light. His form rapidly shrank, returning to its human shape, and the surrounding temporal domain dissipated.

Using the Heaven-Slaying Prison technique and the temporal domain had exhausted his spiritual energy. Since he had entered the light shield, he no longer needed to continue expending his energy.

"That's good," Jiao San said, her face relaxing.

However, she soon noticed Han Li's gaze fixed intently on the distant, dark red sun, his brow furrowed in concern.

"Could it be?" Jiao San's heart tightened.

Just then, a sudden, unexpected change occurred!
