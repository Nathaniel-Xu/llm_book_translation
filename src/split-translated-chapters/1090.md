"What!" The bearded man's eyes widened in shock as the Five-Clawed Thunder Dragon was instantly subdued. He had previously seen Han Li's formidable strength and the mysterious Time Law divine ability, so he had used all his might to attack. First, he had restricted Han Li's power with his spiritual domain, then he had sacrificed his own Law Crystals to cast the "Electric Light Reversal" secret technique, forcibly increasing his spellcasting speed. Finally, he had summoned all his Law Crystals to launch a full-force attack.

He had thought that even if he couldn't kill Han Li, he could at least severely injure him. But he had never expected to be blocked by his opponent.

The bearded man's temperament was already violent, and being sealed by the Taishang Immortal for so many years had made his personality even more extreme. After breaking free, he had immediately vented his anger towards Han Li and the other True Immortal Realm cultivators, eagerly seeking to kill them.

But now, his strongest technique had failed to defeat Han Li, and his raging anger had subsided, replaced by a hint of retreat.

Han Li, who had subdued the Five-Clawed Thunder Dragon, also felt a slight sense of relief. He silently scolded himself for being too arrogant, thinking that if he had deployed his Time Spiritual Domain from the beginning, he wouldn't have fallen into such a precarious situation.

As he pondered, his movements didn't slow down. With a flick of his wrist, a blue-green jade gourd appeared in front of him - the Xuantian Gourd.

At this moment, a loud rumbling sound suddenly erupted beside Han Li, followed by a massive explosion of golden light. It was the golden flame from the altar.

Earlier, with the constant changes, Han Li had almost forgotten about the flame.

Now, the golden flame and the surrounding Time Spiritual Domain seemed to resonate with each other, suddenly swelling to several times its original size. The flame burned fiercely, unaffected by the True Words Treasure Wheel and the Time-Breaking Fire Boundary.

A powerful Time Law fluctuation burst forth from the golden flame, causing the nearby Time Spiritual Domain to tremble.

"What is this...?" Han Li's eyes widened in surprise as he gazed at the golden flame. A peculiar light flashed in his eyes, and he swiftly cast a spell.

Two law seals flew out of his hands, each entering the golden flame and the Xuantian Gourd.

The golden flame wrapped around Han Li's Time Law Crystals, which suddenly lit up, merging with the flame to form a golden shadow. The shadow shot towards the Five-Clawed Thunder Dragon.

Meanwhile, the Xuantian Gourd's green light flashed, and a stream of green light burst out, enveloping the Five-Clawed Thunder Dragon. The gourd's green light was faster, quickly wrapping around the dragon and pulling it back.

The Five-Clawed Thunder Dragon's body shook, and it began to soften, as if it were being melted by the green light.

However, the Five-Clawed Thunder Dragon was formed from over a hundred of the bearded man's Law Crystals, containing an enormous amount of Law energy. Even the Xuantian Gourd couldn't quickly absorb it.

Just then, the golden flame shot out, striking the Five-Clawed Thunder Dragon.

A faint "hiss" sound echoed, and the dragon's body, which had been slightly stirred by the Xuantian Gourd's green light, instantly decayed and broke into two pieces.

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise, and then a look of great joy appeared on his face.

The bearded man, however, was shocked.

But the next moment, the golden flame suddenly fluctuated wildly, and the Time Law energy within it surged violently. The True Words Treasure Wheel and the Time-Breaking Fire Boundary were shaken, and the restraint on the Five-Clawed Thunder Dragon was loosened.

The bearded man's eyes lit up, and his body began to transform. He rolled on the ground, turning into a massive, dozens-of-zhang-long lion-like demon.

The demon's body was a dark, bronze-like color, with lightning-shaped black patterns on its skin. Two curved black horns protruded from its head, surrounded by black lightning.

The demon's horns glowed with a fierce, black lightning, like two small black suns.

The broken Five-Clawed Thunder Dragon suddenly lit up, shrinking rapidly to form two black lightning rings, one large and one small.

The two lightning rings burst forth with intense, unparalleled lightning energy, which was not stronger than the Five-Clawed Thunder Dragon but more refined and sharper. They broke free from the Xuantian Gourd's green light and pushed back the True Words Treasure Wheel and the Time-Breaking Fire Boundary.

The two lightning rings shot out, flying beyond the True Words Treasure Wheel and the Time-Breaking Fire Boundary.

"You won't escape!" Han Li's face darkened, and he spat out a blue and a golden light.

The blue light entered the Xuantian Gourd, and the gourd's green light flashed. A stream of green light burst out, pursuing the two lightning rings.

The green light was faster than before, quickly catching up to the lightning rings and enveloping them.

A dozen or so green crystals emerged from the green light, wrapping around the lightning rings. The lightning rings' radiant light dimmed, and they stopped moving.

The golden light flew towards the golden flame, and a net of golden light formed, encasing the flame.

The Time Law fluctuations within the golden flame were immediately suppressed, and the True Words Treasure Wheel and the Time-Breaking Fire Boundary's tremors began to subside.

Han Li's hands moved swiftly, casting a spell. The True Words Treasure Wheel's range expanded rapidly, spreading towards the two lightning rings.

The bronze lion demon's eyes widened in surprise, and it let out a deafening roar. The black lightning patterns on its body glowed brightly, and all the light converged towards its two black horns.

The demon's horns glowed with an intense, black lightning, like two small black suns.
The two black horns suddenly became transparent, emitting a flash of lightning that was almost impossible to gaze at directly.

The large black lightning ring in the emerald green aura flashed with lightning and suddenly struggled free from the emerald green aura's restraints, flashing into the copper lion's mouth.

The smaller lightning ring, however, despite its struggles, seemed to lack the power to break free from the emerald green aura's restraints, and was enveloped by the golden ripples that spread out, instantly solidifying in place.

Then, the emerald green aura contracted, enveloping the black lightning ring, and with a "whoosh" sound, it disappeared into the Xuantian Gourd.

The copper lion demon saw this scene and its two eyes suddenly turned blood red, letting out a thunderous roar, causing the entire cave to shake.

Han Li sneered, his body transforming into a golden shadow as he pounced towards the copper lion demon.

His time domain also surged forward, enveloping the copper lion demon.

"You human brat, I'll remember you!" The copper lion demon, having previously experienced Han Li's time laws, had been left with a lingering fear, and after a furious roar, its massive body transformed into a black lightning bolt, shooting towards the front of the cave and disappearing in an instant.

The other demon tribes in the cave saw the copper lion demon escape and lost the will to fight, following after it and disappearing into thin air.

Han Li didn't pursue, stopping his body and retracting his time domain and the True Speech Treasure Wheel.

As the time domain retracted, the golden flame also stopped its rolling motion, rapidly shrinking back to its original state.

However, the golden flame had shrunk by nearly half, and the power of the time laws within it had decreased significantly, as if the previous attack on the five-clawed dragon had consumed a lot of power.

Han Li's brow furrowed slightly as he gazed at this scene.

The divine ability of the golden flame was similar to that of the fire age firefly, but it was much more powerful, and couldn't be compared.

However, it seemed that the golden flame could only be used once more, which was a pity.

He sighed inwardly, his hand forming a seal as he pointed, and the twenty-odd time law crystals surrounding the golden flame rotated, forming a flower-shaped seal that enveloped the golden flame.

Han Li then waved his sleeve, putting away the golden flower.

Lei Yuze, Lan Yuansu, and the others didn't pursue, as they had all been injured, and had been at a disadvantage when facing the dozens of demon tribes in the Taiyi realm.

As the demon tribes disappeared, they all hurriedly descended to recover.

Han Li had also been exhausted from the intense battle, and took out a medicinal pill to consume, operating his cultivation to refine it.

Half an hour later, Lei Yuze and the others stood up, one by one.

"If it weren't for Brother Han's help, we would have all been buried here today," Lei Yuze said with a complex expression, clasping his hands in respect.

"Brother Lei is too polite," Han Li said with a hint of depth in his voice, "but what's going on with those demon tribes? Brother Lei seems to know something, please tell me the truth."

The others looked at Lei Yuze, awaiting his response.

However, Lei Yuze didn't immediately answer Han Li's question, instead flying towards the previous altar.

The black light portal had already disappeared, leaving behind only a pile of rubble covering the ground.

Lei Yuze waved his hand, sending out a golden light that swept away the rubble, revealing the ground beneath.

On the ground was a dark golden circular stone plate, with a complex formation carved into it, and eight golden stone pillars, each about a foot high, standing at the corners of the formation.

The circular stone plate was now cracked, with several fissures opening up, and the formation was damaged, its array lines dull and lifeless.

Lei Yuze's expression turned heavy, his face covered in a layer of frost.

"Brother Xiong, the current situation is all because of your reckless actions!" Lei Yuze said, his voice stern.

"I apologize, I didn't know that pulling out this sword would cause so many demon tribes to appear, and I will be more cautious in the future," Xiong Shan said, clasping his hands.

Although he apologized, his expression didn't show any regret, and his eyes seemed to gleam with suppressed joy, as he glanced at the Great Wilderness Ancient Sword in his hand.

The sword's body was surrounded by 20-30 golden crystals, which emitted a golden light that merged into the sword, as if refining it.

Lan Yuansu and the others couldn't help but glance at the Great Wilderness Ancient Sword, their faces filled with envy.

Lei Yuze's brow furrowed, but he didn't say anything.

Xiong Shan's strength had originally been the weakest among the group, but now that he possessed the Great Wilderness Ancient Sword, his power had greatly increased, and except for Han Li, no one else had the absolute confidence to deal with him.
