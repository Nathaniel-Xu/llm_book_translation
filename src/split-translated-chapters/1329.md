Yangshan Sect Master's eyebrows twitched upon hearing Han Li's words, and then returned to normal, with a hint of mockery at the corners of his mouth, clearly thinking Han Li was spouting nonsense.

"This Nine Dragon Seal is connected to your memory and divine soul, and within the seal, there are nine different powers. If any external force seeps in, it will immediately conflict and explode. Tsk, tsk, it's truly impossible to handle," Han Li said with a smile.

Yangshan Sect Master's eyes were closed, and upon hearing this, the corners of his mouth curled up in a cold smile.

"It's just that this Nine Dragon Seal is closely related to your divine soul's power. If your divine soul's power weakens, the seal's power will also weaken. For example, if your divine soul becomes a Golden Immortal-level, the Nine Dragon Seal will no longer be a threat, and even if it explodes, it can be easily suppressed," Han Li said, pausing for a moment before continuing.

Yangshan Sect Master suddenly opened his eyes, as if he had thought of something, and a hint of unease flashed across his face.

Han Li didn't say anything else, and with a single hand, he pinched a seal and released a burst of energy.

Five golden lights shot out from his hand, each emitting a different temporal law power. One was explosive like fire, one was gentle like water, one was thick like earth, one was thriving like wood, and one was sharp like metal.

Each golden light revolved around Yangshan Sect Master's body, forming a golden light shield that enveloped him.

Flames, flowing water, sand, trees, and golden wheels appeared on the light shield, and the five temporal law powers perfectly merged and rapidly rotated.

The nearby spiritual realm also flashed with golden light, slowly operating.

The flow of time around Yangshan Sect Master suddenly changed, and he let out a pained cry as his aura rapidly decreased.

Mahayana Late Stage...

Mahayana Middle Stage...

Mahayana Early Stage...

Taiyi Late Stage...

Taiyi Middle Stage...

In an instant, Yangshan Sect Master's cultivation realm dropped from the peak of Mahayana to the Golden Immortal level.

This was not an ordinary decline in cultivation, as the law power, the number of divine apertures, and the divine soul's power had all decreased to the Golden Immortal level.

To return to his previous cultivation, he would have to undergo another period of bitter cultivation.

The golden light shield around Yangshan Sect Master fluctuated a few times before disappearing.

"What...what did you do to me?" the old man exclaimed, shocked and horrified, as he felt the changes in his body.

Immediately, a resolute glint appeared in his eyes, and his divine soul's power surged, trying to self-destruct.

But with his current cultivation, his spellcasting speed was too slow, and Han Li's massive hand pressed down on Yangshan Sect Master's head, suppressing his actions with overwhelming soul power.

Han Li's face remained calm, and with his current cultivation, using the Five Elements Illusory World Divine Ability was no longer as difficult as before. He waved his hand, and it was done.

Yangshan Sect Master's divine soul's power had also dropped to the Golden Immortal level, and the Nine Dragon Seal within him was unable to stop Han Li's soul search.

A stream of dim light penetrated into Yangshan Sect Master's mind, quickly breaking through the Nine Dragon Seal and entering his memories.

"The Fog Dragon Secret Realm, it was here all along...if I had known, you wouldn't have had to suffer," Han Li said, his eyebrows raised, a cold smile spreading across his face as he withdrew his hand.

Yangshan Sect Master's eyes rolled back, and he fainted.

Han Li waved his hand, releasing a burst of golden light that enveloped Yangshan Sect Master's body.

Yangshan Sect Master vanished into thin air, and Han Li's figure also disappeared in a flash.

...

Deep within the Fog Dragon Sect, a valley, three figures descended from the sky, landing in the valley. They were a tall, middle-aged man, a woman in blue robes, and a young man with the surname Ji.

At the end of the valley was an ordinary stone gate, and the three of them approached it, kneeling down.

The young man with the surname Ji took out a stick of incense, lit it, and a wisp of blue smoke floated out, slowly seeping into the stone gate.

Beyond the stone gate was a different world, where the ground was covered in a boundless ocean, with no bottom in sight. A blue sun hung in the sky, emitting blue light that illuminated the water's surface.

The water's surface suddenly erupted with countless blue mist, as if it was being evaporated by the sunlight. The sea's surface was turbulent, with massive waves and giant tails or claws occasionally rising up.

In a vast underwater cave, the space was enormous, with countless rugged rocks forming a stone forest.

Within the stone forest, numerous massive dragon skeletons lay quietly, some as large as 10,000 feet, while the smallest were still hundreds of feet long, densely packed and countless in number.

These dragon skeletons, even in death, still emitted an aura of pride and dominance, looking down upon all living creatures.

This was the Dragon's Grave, a place where dragons lay buried.
Inside the stone cave, a white-haired old man sat cross-legged on a large blue stone, his eyes fixed on the front, his gaze flickering as if considering something.

After a while, Feng Qing Shui suddenly moved, his hand reaching out to the front of the void.

Instantly, a blue mist appeared before him, quickly condensing into a blue whirlpool.

"Pay respects to the elder," three voices came from within, belonging to the three Ji Clan children.

"What's the matter that brings you three to seek an audience?" Feng Qing Shui asked calmly.

"Elder, we shouldn't be disturbing your cultivation, but the sect leader suddenly disappeared from within the sect, seemingly taken by someone. From the scene, it's likely the Dao Ancestor's doing, and we're powerless to do anything, so we came to seek your help," the Ji Clan child said.

"Ah, such a thing has happened, tell me the details of what you saw," Feng Qing Shui's eyebrows moved slightly as he listened.

The Ji Clan child nodded and recounted the events, leaving out no details.

"Yang Shan's activation of the Four Qi Storm Array couldn't even avoid the calamity, and was taken away silently, it's likely the Dao Ancestor's doing," Feng Qing Shui said slowly.

He gazed downward, his eyes sinking. Yang Shan being taken away wasn't a big deal, but the problem was that he hadn't sensed anything.

Although he was within the Wudang Secret Realm, and had been preoccupied with his thoughts, he should have still sensed something if the Dao Ancestor had taken action.

"This matter, you don't need to worry about, I'll investigate..." Feng Qing Shui trailed off, his expression turning solemn.

"Don't bother investigating, your sect leader Yang Shan is in my hands!" a loud voice suddenly interrupted Feng Qing Shui's words.

The voice had barely faded when the Wudang Secret Realm began to shake violently.

A thick golden light descended from the sky, piercing through the sea and stone cave, landing not far from Feng Qing Shui and shattering the blue mist whirlpool.

The Ji Clan children's words of inquiry were cut short as they watched in shock.

Feng Qing Shui's face changed slightly, and he flew backward, a white mist erupting from his body and swirling around him.

His figure became indistinct, like a misty illusion.

The golden light dissipated, revealing a man in a blue robe.

Feng Qing Shui looked at the man, rummaging through his memories for information on the Dao Ancestor, but found nothing.

At their level of cultivation, whether or not someone had altered their appearance was something that could be seen through at a glance. The man before him was his true appearance.

But the man seemed familiar, as if he had seen him before.

Han Li didn't pay attention to Feng Qing Shui, his divine sense already spreading out.

The Wudang Secret Realm was not large, and his divine sense could encompass the entire area.

In the depths of the sea, a multitude of giant dragons swam, all of them pure and unadulterated dragon clans, with many having extraordinary cultivation. There were over a dozen at the Da Luo Realm.

And at the bottom of the sea, within the stone cave, there were countless dragon bones.

This Wudang Secret Realm could be said to be a dragon clan's lair.

Although the dragons were shocking, Han Li wasn't looking for them. His divine sense searched every inch of the secret realm, and soon his face sank.

"It's you!" a voice exclaimed from the front.

Feng Qing Shui's face revealed a look of realization, his eyes fixed on Han Li.

He finally remembered where he had seen Han Li before - many years ago, when he had been sent to the Gray Boundary Nine Underworld Domain to recruit Yin Cheng, a few strange children had intruded into the Nine Underworld City, one of whom was Han Li.

But back then, Han Li's cultivation was weak, and he had barely reached the Tai Yi Realm. It had only been a few years, and yet Han Li's cultivation had reached such a level, leaving Feng Qing Shui perplexed.

"Could it be that this person was intentionally hiding his strength back then? It's possible, since he and another demon disappeared so mysteriously, and I had thought it was a demon clan's powerful expert who had saved him. Now it seems, perhaps it was Han Li's doing," Feng Qing Shui thought to himself.

"Did you capture Wan'er?" Han Li looked at Feng Qing Shui, his eyes cold.

Before coming here, he had already found Feng Qing Shui's image through the Wheel of Reincarnation, and knew that he was the Dao Ancestor he had met in the Gray Boundary, so he wasn't surprised.

"You're talking about who, I don't know," Feng Qing Shui's expression changed, and he regained his composure. "You're still at the Da Luo Realm, but your aura has reached the Dao Ancestor's level. Why did you take our sect leader?"

Han Li sneered, his fingers weaving a seal as a golden light appeared before him, revealing Wan'er's image.

Feng Qing Shui's eyes flickered, and a faint smile appeared on his lips, but he didn't speak.

"You admit it, that's good. Hand her over, and I'll release your sect leader immediately. Otherwise, don't blame me for being impolite," Han Li said heavily.

"Ah, it's been many years since someone has dared to speak to me like this. That woman was indeed captured by me, but it was on the orders of the Heavenly Court. She's already been sent to the Heavenly Court," Feng Qing Shui said calmly.

Han Li had already suspected this, and upon hearing the words, his face turned pale.

"Why did the Heavenly Court capture her?" Han Li took a deep breath, suppressing the cold light in his eyes, and asked solemnly.

"I don't know, I was just following orders. As for the reasons behind it, those above didn't explain," Feng Qing Shui said, his expression strange, as if sizing Han Li up.
