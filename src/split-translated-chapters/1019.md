Xing Shou was originally the bane of all evil spirits and ghosts in the world, let alone the current Qi Hun, who had undergone a series of trials and tribulations, and was now even more formidable.

The blood-red chain connected to his brow was like a giant steel whip, sweeping through the air, unstoppable and unrelenting. The ghostly creatures, no matter how ferocious they appeared, were pierced through the chest like rotten wood, strung together like a skewer of sugar gourds.

"Zzzip!"

A burst of electricity crackled through the air, and a series of blood-red electric arcs erupted from the chain, instantly shattering the thousands of ghostly creatures in the dark clouds, turning them into wisps of black smoke.

The next moment, Xing Shou's nose twitched, and a burst of xiaolongbao-like energy shot out, engulfing the black smoke, absorbing it all into his belly.

Hei Dao was shocked, his hand still holding the knife, but the blood-red chain caught up to him, wrapping around him like a snake.

The blood-red electric arcs crackled wildly, striking the knife body with a series of sharp, piercing sounds.

Hei Dao felt like he was being struck by lightning, his soul like it was being fried in a hot oil pan, his mouth emitting a series of pained screams.

Just then, a dark green light burst forth on his arm, and a series of clear, green vines sprouted out, spreading towards his hand, wrapping around the knife body.

The vines seemed to possess a strange, mystical power, and when struck by the blood-red electric arcs, they rapidly recovered, unaffected, and pierced the gaps between the chain and the knife body, slowly prying them apart.

Hei Dao felt the pressure suddenly ease, and he quickly regained his composure, sheathing the knife, the dark clouds around him dissipating by more than half.

"Thanks, Palace Master..."

Although he had suffered greatly, Hei Dao was already grateful to have escaped with his life, and he hastily thanked Dongfang Bai, who had come to his aid.

But before he could finish speaking, he felt a sudden gust of wind behind him, and his instincts told him something was wrong.

Lü Yun, who was not far away, was the first to notice, as Han Li's figure suddenly disappeared from his original position, only to reappear behind Hei Dao, his eyes wide with fear.

Han Li flashed behind Hei Dao, his hand shooting out to grab his neck, before Hei Dao could react.

Hei Dao's eyes widened, his mouth opening in a silent scream.

Han Li didn't give him a chance to speak, his eyes fixed on Dongfang Bai, his fingers tightening, "Crack"! Hei Dao's neck snapped.

Dongfang Bai was enraged by this action, his hand shooting out to slap Han Li.

The air was filled with the sound of electricity, as the spiritual energy of the heavens and earth was drawn towards Dongfang Bai, condensing into a multitude of wooden stakes, each as thick as a child's arm, shooting towards Han Li.

However, Han Li had already released his hand, his body glowing with a soft, white light, as he dodged the attack with ease, his eyes fixed on Dongfang Bai.

Hei Dao's body fell to the ground, his head striking the ground with a loud thud, his soul still trapped inside, as the Xing Shou's ghostly claws snatched him up, and tossed him into the blood-filled cauldron.

Tao Ji, who had witnessed the entire scene, was terrified, his fear growing exponentially, as he stumbled backwards, falling towards the sea below.

Lü Yun, on the other hand, flew towards Dongfang Bai, his eyes fixed intently on Han Li, his body surrounded by a gray, spiritual aura, as he prepared to defend against another sudden attack.

The loss of a major general had left Dongfang Bai reeling, both shocked and enraged.

He was shocked by Han Li's cultivation, and enraged by the affront to his dignity.

His five fingers curled into a claw, as he grasped the air in front of him, and the wooden stakes that had been scattered around him began to gather, forming a massive, wooden dragon, hundreds of feet long, which lunged towards Han Li, its jaws open wide.

"Wooden stakes? You think you can use them to kill me? This is nothing but a child's plaything!"

Han Li sneered, his fist clenched, as he prepared to strike.

The air was filled with the sound of crackling energy, as the power of the stars and the fist intent gathered in his palm.

"Boom!"

Han Li's fist shot out, the power of the stars exploding from his palm, as a blast of white light illuminated the air.

The wooden dragon struck the light, its body shattering, as it disintegrated into a cloud of dust.

The dust cloud obscured half the sky, but Dongfang Bai's figure suddenly emerged from the midst of it, his eyes fixed intently on Han Li.

He pointed a single finger at Han Li, as a small, green light flashed from his fingertip, forming a wooden stake, which shot towards Han Li's heart.

The wooden stake was surrounded by a faint, dragon-like aura, as it shot out, accompanied by a fierce gust of wind, which distorted the air around it.
Han Li gazed at this scene without avoiding it, simply raising his hand to wave in the air.

A ripple of waves spread out from his side, and a green bamboo sword flashed out, its tip pointing directly at the Coiled Dragon Wooden Spear.

The two of them collided like the tip of a needle and a grain of rice, fiercely striking each other.

It could be seen that the green bamboo sword's talisman flashed, and a golden electric light suddenly burst out, "Zi la" exploding loudly!

Wood fears thunder, and the Coiled Dragon Wooden Spear was struck by this golden thunder, instantly erupting with a burst of black smoke, and shattering open.

"Your Excellency, as the master of a palace, is it that you only have this much ability? It's truly disappointing," Han Li said with a chuckle.

Dongfang Bai heard this and his face's enraged expression suddenly disappeared, instead becoming calm.

His figure leaped up, slowly descending onto the large square in front of the Ancestor's Hall.

"Enough, since I appeared, you've been speaking to provoke me, wasn't it just to lure me onto this square, to enter your pre-set formation. Although it's not as you calculated, entering in a state of fury, I've still entered, so let's see, what can you do to me?" Dongfang Bai looked at Han Li, smiling faintly, with a hint of arrogance.

"Ha ha... Dongfang Palace Master, Han Li didn't think you were unable to withstand ridicule, entering in a state of fury, but it's that you're arrogant and overconfident, entering in a state of self-importance. Since you've come, don't leave," Han Li said loudly.

He spoke, and his hands pinched a seal, the entire small mountain where the Ancestor's Hall was located shook, the surrounding lake's bottom rumbling, four small mountain-like statues of the Angry-Eyed Golden Mighty Ones slowly rose from the ground, each holding a treasure umbrella, a divine sword, a treasure mirror, and a fierce python.

The Angry-Eyed Golden Mighty Ones guarded the four directions, the one holding the umbrella was entirely purple, the treasure umbrella on his hand radiating seven-colored light, flying high into the air, and then having countless rays of light spread out, like a treasure-top light screen, covering the entire small mountain, the area covered by the light, the heaven and earth's primal energy flow suddenly stopped, all techniques and divine abilities were forbidden.

Dongfang Bai was in the midst of this, and suddenly felt the surrounding heaven and earth's spiritual energy tighten, unable to be called upon.

However, his expression didn't change, not being affected in the slightest, as a cultivator of the Wood attribute's laws, his body was like a miniature heaven and earth, his divine spirit power circulating endlessly, originally stronger than other cultivators, and not fearing this kind of method.

But just as he was about to speak, his gaze suddenly flashed, catching a glimpse of a light sphere flying towards him, his heart tightening, and he swiftly dodged to the side, moving over a hundred meters.

When he turned back, he saw that the area where the light sphere had shone was suddenly shattered, a black hole three meters in diameter appearing, the ground inside broken into powder.

He turned his gaze, and saw that it was the person holding the mirror, the treasure mirror's light radiating, like the sun hanging in the air, the light it reflected, causing the space to distort violently.

If he had been struck, his body as a deity would have been broken, his limbs severed.

Before he could think clearly, the person holding the sword and the person holding the python simultaneously attacked.

The treasure sword's talisman shone brightly, clusters of five-colored flames flying out, like a meteor shower, falling down, the python's scales bursting, its mouth spewing out blue lightning and purple electricity, like a waterfall pouring down.

If the treasure mirror's white light still had a chance to dodge, this fire rain and electric waterfall left no room for evasion.

"Such a petty trick, you dare to show off?" Dongfang Bai coldly snorted.

His hands rose, his mouth chanting unceasingly, taking on a posture of supporting the heavens.

His body burst with green light, like a volcano erupting, a giant, ancient tree's illusory image appearing, its canopy like a cover, shielding the fire rain and electric waterfall.

Although it was an illusion, the ancient tree's canopy, when struck by the flames and lightning, actually ignited, burning fiercely.

But as it burned, the tree's canopy seemed to be reborn, its speed seemingly faster than the flames.

Even the treasure mirror's white light couldn't break through the tree's canopy defense.

"Han fellow cultivator, is this your ultimate technique? If so, I'm truly disappointed," Dongfang Bai sneered.

His words had just fallen when he suddenly felt a dizziness, his brow seeming to have a crystal light flash, before he could see clearly, the crystal light had transformed into a small sword, piercing his brow, entering his brain.

Dongfang Bai felt a sharp pain in his brain, his sea of consciousness like a raging storm, his body shuddering violently, the green light bursting out from his back also shaking, and then stopping.

The giant green light tree's image also dissipated, the fire rain and electric waterfall pouring down, instantly engulfing him.

"Rumble rumble..."

A series of thunderous sounds echoed, the purple lightning and five-colored flames intersecting, illuminating the entire Ancestor's Hall square.

"Palace Master..." Tao Ji, who was working together with Lü Yun and the wailing soul-turned Executioner, saw this and couldn't help but cry out in shock.

"Tao Elder, do what you should do, the Palace Master's situation doesn't need you to worry about," Lü Yun said, his hands waving in the air, eighteen red iron flags flying around, surrounding the wailing soul.
