Han Li was overjoyed, and with a wave of his hand, the seven golden pills flew out of the furnace, forming a string that he caught in a small, palm-sized sheep fat jade bottle.

After storing the bottle, he took a deep breath and turned to leave the hall.

As he walked out of the hall, Han Li's eyes scanned the surroundings, and with a flick of his wrist, a silver light flashed beside him, and a silver door slowly opened, revealing a figure walking out.

"Master, this is..." the figure said, looking around.

"We are currently in an unknown xianfu secret realm, and for the time being, it's relatively safe," Han Li said. "I plan to close my doors for a while, and if I can make some progress in my cultivation, I'll have more ways to protect myself when facing the pursuit of the xian palace."

"As we caused a great disturbance in the Jin Yuan Xian Palace and killed the palace master, I'm afraid the news has already spread throughout the xian domain," Han Li said. "The heavenly court will not let us off easily, and they will definitely send out powerful cultivators like Qi Mo. Staying here is the most stable option. Master, you can rest assured and close your doors, and I will protect you."

Han Li pointed to a distant, high-altitude location, where a faint crack was visible in the clouds. "The entrance to this secret realm is over there, and the surrounding area is filled with the original xianfu's restrictions. You only need to pay attention to that area, and you don't need to guard it all the time."

"Okay, I'll guard the front square and cultivate while protecting you," the figure replied.

"By the way, your aura seems to have increased significantly," Han Li said, noticing the change in the figure.

"Master's keen eyes," the figure said with a smile. "Since I woke up earlier, I've felt a strand of faint, yet growing, law energy within me. However, it's accompanied by a constant, unfulfilled hunger."

"Hunger?" Han Li asked, puzzled.

"I'm not sure, but I feel a emptiness in my abdomen, and it only improved slightly after devouring those ghostly creatures," the figure said. "If we encounter more ghost cultivators in the future, we can try again."

"Alright, I'll go to the front hall to close my doors, and the rest is up to you," Han Li said with a smile.

The two of them walked through the garden and arrived at the front hall.

The figure went straight to the sundial in the center of the square and sat down, while Han Li turned and entered the hall.

The hall's furnishings were the same as before, except for the screen that blocked the entrance to the five-colored fire pool. Han Li sat down on the middle white jade cushion.

After a moment of quiet breathing, he opened his eyes, and with a flick of his wrist, he took out the sheep fat jade bottle and poured out a golden pill, which he swallowed.

The pill entered his abdomen, and a rich, law energy immediately emerged, spreading throughout his body.

Han Li closed his eyes and focused his mind, quickly activating the Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue cultivation technique to guide the law energy into his body.

A moment later, he opened his eyes, and a look of surprise flashed across his face.

The white jade cushion beneath him began to glow with a golden light, and the other two cushions also began to shine.

The entire hall was filled with a golden light, as if it had been poured with a layer of golden liquid.

Han Li felt himself being enveloped by a special, time-related law energy, and he was trapped in a strange, indescribable realm.

He was delighted and quickly focused his mind, using his cultivation technique to activate the five types of time law manifestations.

The five manifestations, including the Zhen Yan Bao Lun, the Guang Yin Jing Ping, and the Dong Yi Shen Mu, appeared around him, each with over 1,600 Dao patterns flashing on their surface.

The powerful, time-related law energy emanating from the manifestations made Han Li's heart tremble with excitement.

As the manifestations appeared, the golden light surrounding the hall began to close in, forming a large, golden flower bud that enveloped Han Li.

Han Li felt the time law energy entering his body, and his heart was filled with an unprecedented sense of joy.

He knew that this secret realm must hold more secrets, but for now, his cultivation was the most important thing.

...

Two hundred years passed.

In the white jade square of the xianfu secret realm, a black-clad girl sat cross-legged beside a sundial, her eyes fixed on the distant, high-altitude crack in the clouds.

On her shoulder, a small, silver figure sat with its legs crossed, its body surrounded by silver flames, and seven colorful flames rising from its head.

The girl was Ti Huan, and the small figure was the refined, human-shaped Jing Yan Huo Niao.

After Ti Huan had fully refined the seven-colored fire dan sand, the Jing Yan Huo Niao had grown significantly, and its head was now adorned with seven colorful flames.

Unlike Ti Huan, who was facing the distant crack, the silver figure was facing the golden hall behind her, its legs dangling lazily, and its expression seemed somewhat listless.
"Little Jing, you're also waiting for Master to hurry up and exit seclusion, aren't you?" Qiuhun asked with a smile, noticing Jingyan Huo Niao's emotions.

Jingyan Huo Niao nodded heavily, and the seven-colored flames on its head jumped up and down in response.

Qiuhun knew that Jingyan Huo Niao was eager to show Han Li the power it had gained after absorbing the seven-colored fire sand, and Qiuhun couldn't help but shake its head.

When Qiuhun had first exited seclusion, its body was surrounded by a vortex of silver flames and seven-colored fire, which had almost gotten out of control and burned down the entire secret realm.

Luckily, Qiuhun had intervened in time to control the flames, preventing them from spreading to the buildings. However, the forest in front of them had already been burned to ashes, and even the white jade square had turned a dark, charred color.

Just then, the entire square shook violently, and the entire secret realm began to tremble.

Qiuhun's eyes narrowed, and it suddenly leaped into the air, flying high above the ground.

Jingyan Huo Niao, perched on Qiuhun's shoulder, seemed to have been startled as well, stumbling and almost falling off.

After Qiuhun flew into the air, it looked down and saw that the gray mist surrounding the secret realm was churning violently, as if it was retreating.

As the gray mist retreated, the area of the secret realm began to expand.

"This is the third time since the beginning of the month..." Qiuhun muttered to itself.

Qiuhun had seen this scene before, but each time the mist churned with increasing intensity, and the area of the secret realm that was revealed grew larger.

After about ten breaths, the ground stopped shaking, and the gray mist ceased its churning.

Qiuhun looked at the golden great hall where Han Li was in seclusion, a hint of concern in its eyes.

Eighty years ago, Han Li had already broken through to the late stage of the Taiyi Realm, causing a stir in the secret realm. However, he had not chosen to exit seclusion at that time, instead continuing to cultivate until now.

...

That night.

Inside the golden great hall, a half-transparent golden flower bud stood upright, with Han Li sitting cross-legged inside.

Han Li's skin was translucent like beautiful jade, and his internal organs and meridians could be seen through his skin. On his body, 359 acupoints shone with golden light.

Han Li's cultivation had reached the peak of the Taiyi Realm!

Underneath him, the ring-shaped patterns on the three white jade cushions had dimmed, and the golden light had stopped rippling. It was clear that the time law contained within had been almost depleted.

Just then, Han Li's tightly closed eyes suddenly trembled, and he slowly opened them. A golden light seemed to emanate from his eyes, shining three inches long.

"Ah..."

He opened his mouth, and a wisp of white mist escaped.

After a moment, Han Li's expression calmed, and he slowly blinked his eyes. The strange phenomena surrounding him began to dissipate like mist, and even the golden light in his eyes disappeared.

At this moment, Han Li's body was full of vital energy, and his internal energy was perfectly balanced, without any sharp edges or rough spots.

At first glance, one might not notice anything unusual about him, but if one looked closely, they would sense a faint, intangible aura surrounding him, which was a sign of the Taiyi Jade Immortal body reaching complete transparency.

"It seems that's all for now. Breaking through to the Daluo Realm in one go is impossible..." Han Li said to himself.

He chuckled, feeling a bit greedy.

In just over two hundred years, he had gone from the mid-stage of the Taiyi Realm to the peak, and was now just one step away from achieving the Daluo Realm.

Although he had the support of the strange environment, the seven time law pills, and the 900+ acupoints he had opened, his breakthrough speed was still astonishing.

If he were to reveal this to others, most cultivators would probably not believe him.

Han Li couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment.

After sitting for a while, he slowly stood up, stretched his body, and a series of "cracking" sounds echoed from his joints.

Just as he was about to leave the great hall, a faint "click" sound echoed in his ears.
