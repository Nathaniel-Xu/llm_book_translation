Yuankong, your tribe's young white ape seems to be underage, its bloodline power is not enough..." The Qiying Ape tribe leader spoke first.

"Hmph! I've always said you're useless, and you still have the nerve to be one of the sixteen great wilderness tribes? Where in your bodies is the bloodline of the ancient True Spirit King?" A tall, ape-like man with a loud voice spoke up.

He was the leader of the Baibei Guiren tribe, one of the sixteen great wilderness tribes, and a distant relative of the True Spirit King Zhu Yan. He was naturally inferior to the Qiying Ape tribe, and had always been looked down upon by them.

The old man with the long eyebrows looked at him, sighed, and said nothing.

The Shanyue Giant Ape was different from the other True Spirit Kings, as its bloodline had only been passed down through the Banshan Ape tribe, and not through direct inheritance. As a result, the bloodline power had become weaker with each generation.

Yuanshan Bai was an exception among the Banshan Ape tribe, as his body contained a purer bloodline of the Shanyue Giant Ape than the others. However, perhaps due to his youth or other reasons, his bloodline power was still not enough.

The surrounding voices of criticism grew louder and more intense.

 Inside the Wild Ancient Temple, there were also voices of doubt, with the young white ape being surrounded and filled with feelings of guilt.

"This matter is not something he can control, don't criticize him anymore." A small white figure stood up, blocking the young white ape, and said angrily.

Liu Le'er didn't speak, but chose to stand with them.

"If you're useless, you should be able to bear the criticism..." The young master of the Zouwu tribe said.

"Feeling guilty is useless, the fact that the Shura Blood Gate can't be opened is the fault of the Banshan Ape tribe." The words of the Qingdian tribe's leader sparked even more anger among the crowd.

They were angry because the blood gate couldn't be opened, and they had lost the opportunity to inherit the True Spirit King's bloodline.

Han Li looked at the scene, his eyes slightly sunken, with a hint of hesitation.

"Han Xiao..." At this moment, the white-haired old man, Bai Ze, suddenly spoke up.

The crowd fell silent, and all eyes turned to Han Li.

Han Li sighed inwardly, realizing that the True Spirit King had indeed had a plan in mind when he allowed him to enter the temple.

"Your Majesty..." Han Li pretended to be unaware, and bowed his head.

Bai Ze didn't mind, and stood up from his stone chair, scanning the crowd with his eyes.

"Earlier, you all refused to let Han Xiao enter the mountain, and even considered it a shame for him to enter the temple. But you didn't know that in order to open the Shura Blood Gate, Han Xiao's help is necessary."

The crowd was shocked and surprised.

"Relying on him, a mere mortal..." The Qingdian tribe's leader looked even more incredulous.

"The young white ape's bloodline is not the problem, it's just that it's not fully opened due to its youth. But Han Xiao, although he's a mortal, has the bloodline of the True Spirit King's Shanyue Giant Ape, which is even purer than that of the Banshan Ape tribe." Bai Ze walked towards the crowd, speaking slowly.

The crowd was even more shocked, and Yuanshan Bai's face was filled with surprise.

"Han Xiao, are you willing to lend us a hand?" Bai Ze asked, standing in front of Han Li.

"My body contains many mixed bloodlines, I'm afraid I'll disappoint you." Han Li didn't give a clear answer, but instead pushed back.

"The mixed bloodlines are not a problem, I have a way to separate them. As long as you agree, once the Shura Blood Gate is opened, you can also enter, and your physical defects can be compensated for." Bai Ze said.

The Qingdian tribe's leader and others were filled with complicated emotions, on one hand not wanting Han Li to enter the blood gate, but on the other hand having to ask for his help to open it.

Han Li listened to this, and his heart moved slightly. He smiled, and looked at the Qingdian tribe's leader and the young master of the Zouwu tribe.

The two of them saw his expression, and felt a sense of unease.

"Your Majesty, I have one more request, as long as it's fulfilled, I'll agree." Han Li said.

"Speak freely." Bai Ze replied.

"I need two drops of Zhu Yan's and Chu Yan's pure blood." Han Li said.

Bai Ze was taken aback, but then smiled.

"It's not necessary to go through so much trouble, once the Shura Blood Gate is opened, and someone inherits their bloodline, I'll take two drops of the purest blood for you." Bai Ze said.

Han Li said, "No need, just take one drop each from these two, Qingdian and Zouwu tribe members."

Bai Ze was surprised, as he didn't know that Han Li's body contained mixed bloodlines, and he didn't pursue a single bloodline's strength, but instead sought a balance.

Han Li's request was not to deliberately oppose the Qingdian tribe's leader and the young master of the Zouwu tribe, but because he needed two types of bloodlines to complete his four divine demon forms.

Zhu Yan and Chu Yan, as two of the eight great True Spirit Kings, were the most suitable choices due to their powerful physiques and defensive abilities.

Bai Ze hesitated for a moment, then nodded his head in agreement.

The Qingdian tribe's leader looked at Han Li, his eyes filled with resentment.

"Since Han Xiao is our benefactor, my Zouwu tribe has no objections." The young master of the Zouwu tribe said, with a hint of reluctance in his eyes, but quickly replaced it with a smile.
After speaking, he voluntarily lifted his hand, and a flash of light appeared in his palm, condensing a drop of essence blood. He sent it forward.

Qing Dian's face was filled with confusion as he looked at Zhuo Wu, the young master, but before he could speak, he heard the latter's voice in his mind:

"Qing Dian, don't be troubled by the gains and losses of this moment. Once we inherit the True Spirit King's bloodline, our identity will naturally be different. At that time, wanting to crush him will be as easy as snapping one's fingers."

Qing Dian heard this and suddenly understood. He also condensed a drop of essence blood and sent it flying towards Han Li.

The two drops of essence blood arrived, and Han Li took them in, examining them carefully. He discovered that they had not been tampered with and couldn't help but feel a hint of surprise.

"Thank you..." Han Li said, storing the essence blood in a jade vial.

After speaking, he also condensed a drop of his own essence blood and sent it to Bai Ze.

Bai Ze raised his hand, and the essence blood flew into his palm. He casually wiped it with his finger, and the essence blood began to boil, releasing strands of smoke. It directly burned away the excess essence blood, only refining the essence blood of the Mountain Giant Ape.

Bai Ze flicked his finger, and the essence blood fell into the fire pit.

A loud explosion sounded!

The fire pit erupted with flames, shooting towards the Mountain Giant Ape's statue. The entire hall was once again enveloped in light.

Outside the hall, the crowd was still arguing, but they suddenly felt the ground shake beneath their feet. Dark red light burst forth from the ground, transforming into massive symbol shadows.

The eight ancient paths leading to the mountain peak lit up, and the eight True Spirit King silhouettes reappeared. The light grew even brighter.

The people of the Savage Tribes on the mountain, below the mountain, and in the city of Zhuo Wu all fell to the ground, performing their unique rituals and praying to the heavens.

The earth was filled with light, and the light gathered at the top of the sky, forming a dazzling radiance.

In the distant, boundless Savage Lands, ancient altars that had been buried for millions of years suddenly reawakened, emitting golden light that illuminated the sky.

Countless people from various tribes, at this moment, all made praying gestures, as if the entire Savage World had connected and become one.

At the peak of the mountain, a massive blood-red light gate appeared in the void. The gate was surrounded by countless blood-red lights, which condensed into a giant blood-red door.

On the door pillars, two massive faces appeared: one with a furious expression and the other with a welcoming smile.

On the door, various True Spirit silhouettes floated, including the eight True Spirit Kings, their bloodline descendants, and even the silhouettes of the Dragon, Phoenix, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise from the Immortal Realm.

"It has appeared, it has appeared..."

"The Blood Gate has opened..."

The crowd on the square cheered, and everyone was filled with excitement. The elderly man with the long eyebrows from the Mountain Ape tribe also smiled.

However, inside the stone hall, the atmosphere was somewhat heavy.

On the six stone chairs in front of the eight True Spirit King statues, only the central chair, where Bai Ze sat, was occupied. The other chairs were empty, except for the chairs in front of the statues of Zhuo Wu, the young master, Jiao Yin, the nine-tailed fox, and the Mountain Giant Ape. On each chair, a blood-red silhouette had condensed, taking on a human form.

They all seemed lifelike, but they were only residual bloodline souls. Everyone looked at the silhouettes, feeling a strange, unbridgeable connection.

"Look, it seems that only Luo Hou and You Tian Kun Peng have not fallen..." Bai Ze said, his voice calm and detached, as if only reminiscing about the past.

He waved his hand, and the blood-red silhouettes flowed into the fire pit.

The flames in the fire pit condensed and transformed into a fist-sized blood flame sphere.

"Let's go..." Bai Ze said, taking the blood flame sphere and leading the crowd out of the hall.

As they emerged, the crowd cheered, and everyone called out to them.

"Your Majesty..."

Bai Ze walked to the front of the Blood Gate and shouted, "The Savage World's revival begins today!"

As he spoke, he raised his hand, and the blood flame sphere flew up, landing on the Blood Gate.

A faint explosion sounded.

The blood flame sphere shattered, transforming into a sea of blood-red flames that engulfed the Blood Gate.

The flames burned fiercely, and the True Spirit silhouettes danced wildly. A blood-red vortex appeared, and the Blood Gate officially opened.

The crowd cheered, and everyone was filled with excitement. The elderly man with the long eyebrows from the Mountain Ape tribe smiled, and the atmosphere was filled with joy.

However, inside the stone hall, the atmosphere was still heavy, and the crowd was filled with a sense of reverence and awe.
