Chapter:

Lei Yu Ce's eyes saw this scene, his face slightly sank, and then he gritted his teeth, his body immediately shot out, and in an instant, he appeared in front of the stone door, his hands pressing on the light screen.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

108 golden flying needles shot out from his body, each with a lifelike golden dragon carved on the end, encircling the needle, with clear scales and claws, and a clear head and tail, as if they wanted to ride the clouds and drive the fog, and were crafted with exceptional skill.

In the blink of an eye, the 108 flying needles all pierced into the crystal light screen, embedding nearly half of them.

"Golden Light Absolute Immortal Needle!" someone in the distant crowd shouted.

Lei Yu Ce muttered to himself, and the golden flying needles burst forth with dazzling golden light, and rapidly vibrated.

The crystal light screen shook and trembled, and burst forth with dazzling crystal light, and emitted a piercing shriek, like the sound of thousands of swords clashing.

"Break!"

Lei Yu Ce's eyes flashed with a hint of pain, and the next moment, he suddenly became resolute, his hand grasping the incantation gesture, and his mouth loudly shouted!

The 108 golden needles' light burst forth again, and in an instant, they all disappeared into the crystal light screen, and then exploded inside.

A series of massive explosions shook the air!

The crystal light screen instantly appeared with countless cracks, and then shattered with a loud crash, turning into countless streams of light that scattered, revealing the dark green stone door inside, with no longer any obstruction.

Lei Yu Ce's face relaxed, and the distant crowd of cultivators cheered again, and the cultivators inside the array on the ground also let out a long sigh.

But at this moment, the thunder patterns on the giant tower above suddenly lit up, and flashed wildly, and countless thick gray-black lightning bolts shot out from them, with power and quantity far surpassing before, sweeping out in a fan shape in all directions.

The black and white whirlwind was already weak, and was easily torn apart by the gray lightning.

The black and white double flags fell from the scattered whirlwind, already shattered into several pieces, and no longer had any spiritual energy.

Countless gray lightning bolts broke through the black and white whirlwind, and continued to pour down, covering the ground.

Lei Yu Ce's face changed greatly, and his body flashed, instantly shooting out dozens of miles away, avoiding the danger.

The crowd of cultivators in front of the tower also retreated in shock, and Han Li also retreated with them, floating backward.

He had actually discovered the giant tower's restriction was abnormal earlier than others, but he didn't immediately retreat, and instead waited for a moment, to avoid drawing attention.

The crowd of cultivators in front of the tower were still some distance away, and their reaction was quick, but some people were too close and didn't react in time, and were affected, their bodies directly exploding, and their Nascent Souls couldn't escape.

As for the hundred people inside the array on the ground, they were still bound by the large array, and couldn't escape, and were engulfed by the countless gray-black lightning bolts.

Dazzling electric arcs flashed and danced, forming a gray-black lightning sea, and the terrifying lightning laws churned within, and everything that touched the gray-black lightning was instantly reduced to ashes.

Pitiful screams echoed from the lightning sea, and then immediately disappeared.

Han Li saw this scene, and silently sighed, and then felt a deep sense of wariness towards the ancient tower.

Just the outside restrictions were this dangerous, and the inside situation was naturally even more so.

But at this moment, his eyes suddenly focused, and he vaguely saw a blue light flash in the lightning sea.

Immediately, the lightning sea transmitted a shocking explosion, and a large burst of dazzling white light erupted from within, forming a crescent shape, and the light was dazzling and piercing, tearing apart the gray-black lightning sea.

"Whoosh" "Whoosh" sounds echoed, and over a dozen escape lights shot out from the lightning sea, flying like meteors to the safe area outside, revealing the figures of over a dozen cultivators.

These people were the strongest cultivators from before, with three Taiyi Realm cultivators, and the rest were Golden Immortal peak and Golden Immortal late-stage cultivators.

None of them were unscathed, their clothes were tattered, and their bodies were covered in wounds, and some people were missing hands or feet, looking pitiful and disheveled.

The gray-black lightning sea flashed a few times, and then dissipated, and the ground was scorched black, and a layer of earth was scraped away, and the people inside had all disappeared, leaving only some scattered fragments of immortal artifacts.

Seeing this scene, the crowd's faces were difficult to look at.

"Lei Yu Ce, Wen Zhong, didn't you two say that breaking the restriction wouldn't be too dangerous? What's going on now?" a middle-aged man in a white Daoist robe stepped forward, his face pale, and coldly questioned Lei Yu Ce and Wen Zhong.

The middle-aged man had a white moon wheel immortal artifact floating in front of him, but its light was dim, and its spiritual energy was greatly lost.
The master of the Ling Yue Pavilion, Tian Yue Dao Ren, had reached the mid-stage of the Tai Yi Realm, making him one of the strongest among the group. He had also been selected to join the top 100.

Not only was Tian Yue Dao Ren affected, but the Ling Yue Pavilion's expertise in the extreme yin technique had also led to many of their members entering the double-life formation. Now, they had all been wiped out, and Tian Yue Dao Ren was furious.

The other survivors glared at Lei Yu Ce and his companions.

Many members of the Alliance's large group also looked at Lei Yu Ce with anger in their eyes.

Tian Shui Zong had also had someone enter the double-life formation, but they had not fallen. Therefore, Su Xun and Jin Liu did not ask any questions, instead standing quietly to the side.

"Everyone, please calm down. This was unexpected, even for me," Lei Yu Ce said, his face slightly pale. "I originally thought that if we broke the seal on the stone door, the thousand-needle yin thunder formation on the tower would also disperse. But I didn't expect this to happen."

Tian Yue Dao Ren listened to Lei Yu Ce's words, but his expression did not change, and his anger only intensified.

"Everyone, this is a tragic event, and I and the Alliance leader are also deeply saddened. However, as I said before, we are taking a great risk by exploring the immortal's mansion and the mysterious realm. Who knows when we will die? Life and death are determined by fate. Moreover, the Alliance leader broke two of his precious treasures to break the seal on the tower, which was a huge loss."

Wen Zhong, who was standing next to Lei Yu Ce, stepped forward and said, "This is an unexpected disaster, and it's not right to blame it on one person. The Alliance leader did it for the sake of all of us, so that we could enter the Years Tower and explore its treasures. If not, the casualties would be even greater. Everyone, please calm down."

Jin Liu also spoke up, "For those who unfortunately died, the Alliance will provide some compensation after we finish exploring the immortal's mansion. Everyone, please don't worry."

Tian Shui Zong and Tong Tian Jian Pai both said this, but Tian Yue Dao Ren's expression was still uncertain, and he coldly snorted before turning to leave.

The others were intimidated by the two sects' power and did not dare to say anything else.

Han Li stood in the crowd, but he did not pay attention to the argument. Instead, he glanced at the ten or so people who had just flown out, and behind them, he saw two people, a man and a woman, standing quietly. They were the Lan siblings.

Han Li's divine sense was extremely strong, and he had clearly sensed a powerful spiritual pressure in the thunder sea, which seemed to be a water attribute technique. It was not inferior to his own abilities.

It was this spiritual pressure that had actually opened the thunder sea, not Tian Yue Dao Ren's moon wheel immortal tool.

"From the aura of that spiritual pressure, it seems that it was these two people. They are hiding their true identities, and their clothing and attire suggest that they are cultivators of the water attribute. And they are two people... Could they be the Lan siblings from the Jin Han Xian Palace?" Han Li quickly withdrew his gaze, and his mind began to spin with thoughts.

"Brother, I'm sorry. Earlier, I was in a hurry and accidentally broke through the thunder sea. Will we be discovered?" Lan Yan's eyes flashed with a hint of guilt as she whispered to her brother.

"It's okay, Lan Yan. Even if you didn't act, I would have. And the thunder sea's power was enough to conceal your aura. With the divine sense of the people here, it's impossible for them to detect anything," Lan Yuan Zi reassured her.

Lan Yan listened to her brother's words and felt a slight sense of relief.

Tian Shui Zong and Tong Tian Jian Pai walked together, discussing something in hushed tones.

"Now that the seal on the Years Tower has been broken, we shouldn't waste any more time. Let's enter the tower quickly, or we might be surpassed by others. However, the seal on the tower was so powerful, and the inside will surely be even more dangerous. The Alliance leader and I have discussed this, and we've decided that those with lower cultivation should not enter the tower. It's better to avoid any more casualties and grievances."

Jin Liu stepped forward and said, "Those with cultivation below the Gold Immortal Realm should not enter the tower. The risk is too great, and the survival rate is low. It's better for them to stay outside and keep watch."

This statement caused a stir among the crowd.

"Jin Liu, what do you mean by 'lower cultivation'?" a Gold Immortal Realm cultivator asked immediately.

"Those below the Gold Immortal Realm are too weak and should stay outside," Jin Liu replied.

"This is unfair! We were all called to participate in the formation earlier, and now that the seal has been broken, you're not letting us enter the tower. What's the logic behind this?"

Many of the cultivators from the sects and the scattered immortals began to argue and protest.

"Silence!" Lei Yu Ce's voice was not loud, but the air around him seemed to vibrate with a powerful aura.

The cultivators who had been arguing were immediately silenced, their faces pale.

"This decision is for everyone's safety. However, the Alliance will give 30% of the treasures we find inside the tower to those who stay outside as compensation. You can also choose to leave and explore other areas. This secret realm is vast, and time is limited. There's no need for everyone to gather here."

Lei Yu Ce's words calmed the crowd, and many of the cultivators began to nod in agreement.

The sects and the scattered immortals both felt that this was a fair decision, and they began to make arrangements for their members to stay outside and keep watch.
