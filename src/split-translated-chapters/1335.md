A vast, unknown void.

The master of the Wheel of Reincarnation, dressed in a black robe and wearing a conical hat, stood at the edge of a floating cliff, with a small, ordinary-sized Void Mirror floating in front of him. The mirror's surface flickered with light, as if someone's shadow was moving within.

Upon closer inspection, it became apparent that the shadow in the mirror was none other than Han Li and Nangong Wan. The master of the Wheel of Reincarnation had been keeping a close eye on the situation.

Behind him, a group of seven or eight people stood, led by a figure wearing a black robe, with his face, neck, and arms wrapped in bandages. This was none other than Yuan Chongfeng, a cultivator of the Bu Tian Sect.

Yuan Chongfeng stepped forward, coming to stand behind the master of the Wheel of Reincarnation.

"Master, when Nangong Wan left the Underworld, I foresaw that she would be captured by the Heavenly Court. Why did you not intervene, and instead allowed her to be taken?"

"Nangong Wan's personality is similar to that of the Frost Goddess, and now that she has inherited many of the Frost Goddess's memories, her personality has become even more stubborn. She will not change her mind, and I can only keep her here by force," the master of the Wheel of Reincarnation replied casually.

"If that's the case, then we can still intervene when she is being pursued," Yuan Chongfeng said.

"The Heavenly Court will not hesitate to use any means necessary to achieve their goals. Today, Nangong Wan is being pursued because of me, and in the future, it is likely that she will be pursued because of Han Li. He cannot escape this fate," the master of the Wheel of Reincarnation said calmly.

"His conflict with the Heavenly Court is inevitable. The Heavenly Court will not tolerate anyone who opposes them, and will stop at nothing to eliminate them," Yuan Chongfeng said, after a moment's thought.

"Furthermore, I am also trying to deceive the Heavenly Court. They have been searching for me for millions of years, but have been unable to find me. Now, with this incident, I have finally 'lost my composure' and they think I am going to confront them head-on," the master of the Wheel of Reincarnation said, a hint of amusement in his voice.

"However, this plan is still a risk. If Nangong Wan is really taken to the Heavenly Court, things will become complicated," Yuan Chongfeng said, after a moment's silence.

"Feng Qing Shui is a fool, but his superior is not. The Bu Tian Sect knows that I am not someone to be trifled with, and they will not dare to provoke me. Therefore, they will not send Nangong Wan to the Heavenly Court, and will instead keep her in custody," the master of the Wheel of Reincarnation said calmly.

"Even so, if Nangong Wan is injured during the pursuit, it will be a disaster," Yuan Chongfeng said.

"You have already foreseen the outcome of this event. If something unexpected happens, will you not be responsible?" the master of the Wheel of Reincarnation asked, his eyes glinting with amusement.

Yuan Chongfeng's face turned pale, and he felt a chill run down his spine.

After a moment's silence, the master of the Wheel of Reincarnation laughed and said, "With me keeping an eye on things, there will be no unexpected events."

"Of course," Yuan Chongfeng replied, nodding his head.

The master of the Wheel of Reincarnation turned his gaze back to the mirror, where Han Li and Nangong Wan were still visible.

"Master, will this plan really work? Will Han Li be provoked into joining us in our fight against the Heavenly Court?" Yuan Chongfeng asked, his eyes fixed on Han Li.

"In this world, there is no one who understands Han Li better than I. The dragon has a reverse scale, and whoever touches it will die. Nangong Wan is Han Li's reverse scale, and now that his cultivation has increased, he will not back down. Ah..."

The master of the Wheel of Reincarnation's words were cut off, as he suddenly exclaimed, "Ah!"

The mirror in front of him suddenly shattered, as Han Li's eyes locked onto the master of the Wheel of Reincarnation, and a burst of light illuminated the area.

Everyone present, including Yuan Chongfeng, was shocked by this sudden turn of events.

"Master, what's going on?" Yuan Chongfeng asked, his voice trembling.

"It's nothing. He has discovered my surveillance... and has even erased the Wheel of Reincarnation's mark from Nangong Wan's body," the master of the Wheel of Reincarnation said, his voice calm and amused.

"Doesn't this mean that he will guess that this is all a ruse, and will not be provoked into action?" Yuan Chongfeng asked.

"Perhaps, but the outcome will be the same," the master of the Wheel of Reincarnation replied, his smile unwavering.

...

In a certain location in the Dragon Abyss, a vast and ancient forest stretched out as far as the eye could see.

Under a towering, hundred-meter-tall tree, Han Li and Nangong Wan stood facing each other.

"What's wrong?" Nangong Wan asked, her face pale.

Han Li did not immediately respond, but instead looked around cautiously, his eyes scanning the surroundings. Finally, his gaze came to rest on a strange, grayish-white rock in the distance.

The rock was unlike any other in the area, and Han Li's eyes narrowed as he stared at it.
Only a gray-white winged moth was perched on the stone, its four wings fluttering gently, yet it didn't fly away.

"Hmph, first it was dry grass, then it was a fish, followed by a spiritual bird, and now it's a moth, following us all the way. Don't you find it annoying?" Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he let out a cold snort.

The next instant, a beam of crystal light shot out from his eyes, and the gray-white moth exploded into a cloud of ash.

Nangong Wan was taken aback, and her brow furrowed in surprise.

"Why did the moth have the fluctuations of the reincarnation law on its body?" Nangong Wan asked, puzzled.

"It's the method of the Reincarnation Palace Master," Han Li replied.

After speaking, he gazed intently at Nangong Wan, carefully examining her for a moment before lifting his hand to touch the back of her neck.

Nangong Wan didn't resist, and she leaned her head towards him.

Han Li's palm landed on the back of her neck, and a faint warmth emanated from his palm, accompanied by a soft golden glow.

Nangong Wan felt a slight burning sensation, but it only lasted for a moment before passing.

"Did he leave a mark on me?" Nangong Wan asked, her brow furrowed, after Han Li withdrew his hand.

"Like the moth just now, it's probably the Reincarnation Palace Master's method to protect you. If Feng Qingyu were to harm you, he should be able to intervene through these methods. However, now that I'm by your side, these methods are no longer necessary." Han Li smiled and said.

Nangong Wan's heart warmed upon hearing his words, and a gentle smile spread across her face.

"What's past is past; what's important is that we can be together," she said.

"Unfortunately, there are some people who don't want us to have a peaceful life," Han Li sighed.

"Let's leave this place, return to the Spiritual Realm, or the Mortal Realm, or even the Ancient Realm. As long as we leave this place of strife, it's fine," Nangong Wan said, her voice calm, as she grasped Han Li's hand.

"It's useless. Over the years, I've always thought I was living according to my own desires, and no matter how difficult things got, I was always following my own path. But the more I went on, the more I realized that the influence of the Heavenly Dao's fate is everywhere," Han Li said, his voice laced with a hint of bitterness, as he gently stroked Nangong Wan's hair.

"The Heavenly Dao's path is unpredictable, where is the fate? If there truly is fate, I should thank it for bringing you to my side," Nangong Wan said, shaking her head.

"This matter... is indeed worthy of thanks," Han Li said, his voice momentarily stuck, before he smiled.

Nangong Wan saw this and smiled as well, her eyes curving upwards.

"Now that I've reached the peak of the Great Luo Realm, I can increasingly feel the collision of the Great Dao between the Time Dao Ancestor and myself. I can vaguely see the flow of the River of Time, and the Time Dao Ancestor is like the deity controlling the river's flow. As for me, I'm like a thief trying to divert the river's flow," Han Li said slowly.

"If you can sense it, then he..." Nangong Wan's voice trailed off, her heart filled with a sense of foreboding.

"The Time Dao Ancestor has definitely sensed it as well. The Great Dao may seem to have countless paths, but the further you go, the more it converges into one. Those who are lucky will find an empty bridge, while those who are unlucky will find a narrow path, and I'm inevitable," Han Li said, his eyes narrowing.

Nangong Wan felt the force of Han Li's grip on her hand increase, and she knew that his mind was made up, so she didn't continue to persuade him.

"Since you've decided to face this head-on, I may not be able to help you, but I'll accompany you, standing by your side," Nangong Wan said calmly, her eyes filled with determination.

"No. The Heavenly Court is like a tiger's lair, full of deadly traps. I won't let you take such a risk," Han Li said, shaking his head.

"Listen to me... in Gan Ruxue's memories, I once fought against the Ancient Ones with him. Although we failed, I don't regret it. This time, I want to accompany you as well. If we lose, I'll see it through to the end with you; if we win, I want to witness that moment," Nangong Wan said, her hands grasping Han Li's arms, her expression solemn.

Han Li nodded slightly, looking at Nangong Wan's determined gaze, and his heart sighed. He couldn't bring himself to refuse her.

"After this, it seems like no matter where I put you, I won't be able to put my mind at ease," Han Li said.

"Perhaps the most dangerous place is the safest. If I'm by your side, you'll be able to truly put your mind at ease and fight with all your might," Nangong Wan said, smiling.

"If you insist on following me, once we enter the Middle Earth Immortal Realm, you must stay in the Flower Branch Space unless absolutely necessary," Han Li said, his expression serious.

"Alright, I promise," Nangong Wan said, nodding heavily.

Han Li's expression relaxed slightly, and he gazed at Nangong Wan's lovely face, a sense of detachment washing over him.

"What are you looking at?" Nangong Wan's ears turned slightly red, and she looked away, her voice barely above a whisper.
