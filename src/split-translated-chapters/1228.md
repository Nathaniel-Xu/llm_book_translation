Luoyuanshan furrowed his brow and asked, "Elder Yu, judging from the explosion's power, it doesn't seem like an ordinary spirit beast. Could something have happened to your esteemed sect?"

As soon as he spoke, everyone's gaze fell upon the stout elder.

"Everyone, please don't jump to conclusions," Elder Yu said gravely. "It's just that some spirit beasts have escaped, and they all have unique abilities, making them difficult to capture. There's no need to be alarmed, just wait patiently here."

Elder Yu, if something has happened, I hope you'll inform us truthfully. Perhaps we can also offer some assistance?" Zhou Xianyang asked, his brow furrowed slightly.

Elder Yu snorted, "Ha! When has the Nine Yuan Sect ever needed outside help?"

Zhou Xianyang hastily apologized, "I spoke out of turn, forgive me, Elder Yu. Since the Bodhi Order has already been bestowed, we're of no use here. Why don't we leave and return to our respective sects, rather than causing trouble for your esteemed sect?"

As soon as he finished speaking, the Nine Yuan Pavilion shook violently once more, with an even greater intensity than before. The wooden pillars in the hall developed visible cracks, and if not for the restrictive spell, the entire structure might have collapsed.

Feng Tianxian, the heavenly envoy, frowned slightly, seemingly displeased. He stood up and asked, "What's going on with the Nine Yuan Sect? It's just a matter of spirit beasts escaping, yet you're making such a big fuss about it?"

The stout elder, naturally, didn't dare to gloss over the heavenly envoy's inquiry. After a brief moment of hesitation, he bowed and explained, "Reporting to the heavenly envoy, the disturbance in the Spirit Beast Mountain was just the beginning. Afterwards, various parts of the Nine Yuan Sect experienced unrest, with multiple incidents occurring simultaneously, making it seem chaotic."

"Where is Pure Jun Zhenren now?" Feng Tianxian asked.

"Our sect leader is currently stationed at the Ancestral Hall, worried that something might happen there. Once the unrest subsides, he will return here," Elder Yu explained hastily.

Upon hearing this, the crowd erupted into chaos once more, requesting that Elder Yu open the restrictive spell and let them leave.

"None of you should make a scene, just wait patiently here," Elder Yu said, his face sinking as he glared at the crowd.

Zhou Xianyang and the others fell silent, not daring to speak further.

"The Nine Yuan Sect has quite the nerve, treating us like this. These people have, after all, received the Bodhi Order and are qualified to participate in the Bodhi Banquet as guests from the Middle Earth Realm. What is Elder Yu trying to do?" Feng Tianxian narrowed his eyes and spoke coldly.

"I don't dare..." Elder Yu apologized hastily.

"Heavenly Envoy, please calm down. Since Pure Jun Dao has personally taken action, there's no need to worry. I've heard that the heavenly envoy is skilled at playing Go, why don't we have a match?" Tian Xingzun, who had been quiet until now, stood up and intervened on behalf of Elder Yu.

"I see that Elder Yu isn't intentionally causing trouble, but since the Nine Yuan Sect has encountered problems, it's indeed not suitable for others to leave at this time," Luochuan Feng added.

Feng Tianxian heard this and naturally understood the underlying meaning, so he sat back down.

Tian Xingzun sat across from him, and with a flick of his sleeve, a green jade Go board appeared on the table between them, along with two Go containers.

Feng Tianxian had initially been uninterested, but upon seeing the objects on the table, a hint of curiosity flashed in his eyes. He opened the black Go container, and a faint purple glow emanated from it.

The Go pieces inside the container were surrounded by a purple aura, with tiny, shining lights on each piece, resembling stars in the night sky. They emitted a gentle, starry power that seemed exquisite.

"Could this be the legendary 'Star River Go' set?" Feng Tianxian's eyes lit up as he asked.

Tian Xingzun smiled, "The heavenly envoy has a keen eye, indeed it is this very set. If you win this game, I'll gift it to you as a bonus, what do you say?"

Feng Tianxian laughed, "Ha! I'm glad Tian Xingzun has a taste for this. I'll play along for a bit."

He immediately set up the board and began playing against Tian Xingzun, no longer paying attention to the others.

After this commotion, the others didn't dare to speak up again, and could only wait quietly for the external chaos to subside.

Huoyuan glanced at the crowd and began discussing the secrets of the Golden Source Realm with Luochuan Feng. However, their conversation was already isolated from the others by a secret technique, making it impossible for anyone to eavesdrop.

The crowd fell silent once more, and the grand hall returned to its former tranquility, with only the occasional sound of Go pieces being placed on the board coming from Feng Tianxian and Tian Xingzun.

"Clack"

Feng Tianxian placed a Go piece that shone with starlight on the middle of the board, a smile on his face.

"Respectful sir, it seems you're intentionally gifting me this game, or else why would you make mistake after mistake, allowing me to gain control of the board?" Feng Tianxian asked Tian Xingzun, smiling.

Tian Xingzun chuckled, "The heavenly envoy is joking, of course. As for Go, I'm naturally no match for you. However, this board is also a formation, and the pieces are like seeds. Once placed, they can't be taken back. Perhaps the game isn't just about the pieces on the board."

Feng Tianxian was taken aback, "What do you mean, sir?"

Tian Xingzun didn't respond, instead smiling and saying, "It's my turn to make a move."

He picked up a white Go piece and placed it on the center of the board.

As the piece landed, the green jade board suddenly lit up with a purple glow.

A violent, starry power erupted from the board, sending shockwaves in all directions, shattering the surrounding furniture and decorations into splinters.
Huo Yuan and Lu Chuanfeng were also affected and retreated a hundred feet, looking towards that direction.

They saw that the table with the chessboard had already been reduced to dust, and the Qingyu chessboard had disappeared. On the ground, a large, circular Qing light chessboard with a diameter of tens of feet appeared.

The 19 lines on the board were transformed into thick, white light lines that wrapped around Feng Tian's body, connecting him to the chessboard on the ground, rendering him immobile.

The white chess pieces on the board had formed a complex starlight array, with purple starlight swirling around it, emitting intense starlight fluctuations.

At the same time, Tian Xing Zun, standing opposite him, had a smile on his face, his hands clasped together in a Buddhist gesture.

"Today, I have a great task to accomplish, and I must borrow the head of the Celestial Messenger."

As Tian Xing Zun's voice boomed, his hands suddenly thrust forward.

The white chess pieces on the ground immediately lit up, transforming into dozens of thick, starlight dragons that rushed towards Feng Tian's vital points.

This all seemed to happen in slow motion, but in reality, it occurred in the blink of an eye.

Feng Tian had no time to react, and could only rely on his instincts to activate his own laws, conjuring a layer of pale blue water armor around his body.

When Han Li's gaze fell upon the water armor, he noticed something unusual - the water vapor and ripples on its surface seemed to contain an immense, ocean-like power.

"Tian Xing Zun, have you gone mad?" Huo Yuan exclaimed, his eyes widening in shock.

He flashed forward, intending to intervene, but it was too late.

The dozens of starlight dragons suddenly burst into Feng Tian's water armor, causing a massive disturbance.

The armor's surface churned with clouds and mist, as if the dragons were struggling to move forward.

Huo Yuan, the master of Baizao Mountain, had already reached the scene, with Lu Chuanfeng close behind.

"Your abilities are more impressive than I expected, Celestial Messenger," Tian Xing Zun said, his voice laced with regret.

As he spoke, his hands changed into a different gesture, and his body rapidly retreated.

The dozens of starlight dragons within Feng Tian's water armor suddenly burst into a brilliant, white light.

Within the light, faint purple starlight was visible, releasing a terrifying, starlight-infused energy.

A deafening explosion shook the air.

A massive, starlight energy burst forth from Feng Tian's body, transforming into a towering, white light vortex that rapidly expanded in all directions.

The vortex was accompanied by a howling wind that shredded the surrounding space, causing the air to distort and writhe.

However, the energy seemed to be contained, only affecting the space around Feng Tian, without spreading further.

The top of the vortex had torn open the restrictive array above, creating a large hole in the roof of the Nine Yuan Pavilion.

Tian Xing Zun escaped through the hole, his body transformed into a rainbow-colored light that shot into the distance.

Huo Yuan's eyes blazed with anger as he gazed at the blurry figure within the vortex. He turned to Lu Chuanfeng, who had caught up, and shouted:

"Lu Gong, take care of the Celestial Messenger. I'll go after Tian Xing Zun."

With that, he waved his hand, summoning a ten-foot-long, cyan-purple flying needle that appeared in the air.

He leapt onto the needle, which flashed with symbols, and disappeared into the distance.

Lu Chuanfeng, who had been about to leave, returned to the scene, his brow furrowed in concern.

The other people in the hall, though unaffected by the blast, were shocked and retreated to the corner of the hall, their eyes wide with fear.

They couldn't believe what they had just witnessed. Had Tian Xing Zun, the leader of the Day and Night Alliance, really attempted to assassinate the Celestial Messenger of the Heavenly Court?
