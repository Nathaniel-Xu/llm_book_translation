Han Li stood in front of the four statues, his eyes flashing slightly.

Among them, the one on the far left was obtained from Du Qingyang and had already been cultivated in the previous blood formation. The two beside it were obtained from E Wai not long ago.

The last one was taken out by Han Li from the Flowing Branch space using the remaining bit of Immortal Spirit Power he had left.

According to what E Wai said, there should be a total of four such statues, and these should be all of them.

When Han Li thought of this, a hint of gloom inevitably appeared in his heart.

At that time, his Immortal Spirit Power was almost exhausted, only enough to take out this one statue. Even if he wanted to enter the Flowing Branch space again to take another look, he couldn't do it.

He had thought he would be able to return from the Accumulated Scaly Void soon, but he didn't expect it to take so long. What about Ti Hun, who was still sleeping on the second floor of the bamboo building? How was he doing?

However, no matter how worried he was, there was nothing he could do about it now.

The Third Prince, Shi Pokuoju, had ulterior motives, and his so-called method of returning to the Demon Realm was completely unusable. The only way to leave the Accumulated Scaly Void was to wait for the Crab Daoist to recover.

Now that the Eldest Prince, Shi Zhanfeng, had fallen, even if he returned to the Demon Realm now, he probably wouldn't be able to ask him to abide by the agreement and have the High Priest come to treat Ti Hun.

Moreover, the Demon Realm was already in chaos, and the subsequent struggle for the throne would only intensify. Han Li didn't want to get involved in it anymore.

Putting aside his chaotic thoughts, Han Li picked up the second statue and took a deep breath. A flash of light appeared between his eyebrows, and a crystal beam of light shot out from it, entering the black statue.

Immediately after, just like the first statue before, this one began to make all sorts of strange gestures, and behind it, a dense array of profound texts appeared, naturally containing the contents of the Heaven Slaying Prison Skill.

Han Li's eyes were fixed on the movements of the statue, and he began to imitate them.

...

On a distant continent, far away from here, there was a magnificent city with a dense array of guards.

In the center of the city, in a grand palace, a beautiful woman sat on a high platform, leaning against a white jade chair, listening with a relaxed expression to the report of a handsome man below her.

If Han Li were here, he would have recognized the woman as the master of the Puppet City, Sha Xin, and the man reporting to her as Zhuo Ge.

"Reporting to the City Master, the situation in the Mysterious City has basically stabilized. Although the five major cities and some affiliated small cities have put up some resistance, they were quickly suppressed. By the way, Gu Qianxun has been very helpful in this process," Zhuo Ge said respectfully.

"I heard that in Xuanzhi City, the elders and their clans who originally followed Qin Yuan, even those who took the lead in surrendering and pledging their loyalty, were all slaughtered?" Sha Xin asked casually, her tone devoid of any emotion.

"This... It was done by Gu Qianxun, but only after the Six Flower Madam gave her approval. He said he would explain it to you himself." Zhuo Ge hesitated for a moment before answering.

"They have some old grudges between them, it doesn't matter, let them do as they please." Sha Xin said indifferently.

"In this matter, Gu Qianxun acted decisively. Instead of relying on his influence to kill people, he fought in the city's Xuan Battle Arena for seven days and seven nights, a total of eighty-one matches, killing those people one by one. Not only did this not provoke the anger of the people of Xuanzhi City, but it actually won over quite a few hearts." Zhuo Ge said carefully.

"Since they are willing to serve under the Master, let Six Flower Madam be the City Master of Xuanzhi City. Have the City Masters of the other cities been decided yet?" Sha Xin nodded and then asked.

"Mysterious City is temporarily under the control of the Six Flower Madam, and the Zhu Ziyuan siblings have voluntarily come to pledge their allegiance, assisting in managing Mysterious City. It has been the smoothest transition. The other cities have suffered many deaths, but the City Masters have all been chosen." Zhuo Ge reported.

"As one of the main cities comparable to Puppet City, Mysterious City needs to be closely monitored, both openly and secretly. Necessary surveillance cannot be lacking." Sha Xin instructed.

"I will follow the City Master's orders," Zhuo Ge replied.

"These are small matters, you can handle them as you see fit. How many of the ruins I ordered you to excavate have been found?" Sha Xin waved her sleeve lightly and asked.

"So far, only twenty-one have been found, and the remaining eighty-seven are still being sought." Zhuo Ge answered.

"These ruins are scattered throughout the Accumulated Scaly Void, and some are in remote and dangerous places where people rarely venture. Finding twenty-one can be considered a fast pace. However, there's no need to rush too much. As long as they can all be excavated within the next thousand years, it will be fine." Sha Xin nodded and said.

"Yes!" Zhuo Ge responded, clasping his fist.

"This matter concerns the Master's re-control of the Accumulated Scaly Void after he comes out. Remember, there must be no mistakes. Alright, you may go now." After Sha Xin finished speaking, she waved her hand, dismissing Zhuo Ge.

Zhuo Ge bowed in response, then turned and left.

...

In the western district of Puppet City, within a large mansion, all was silent.

In an underground secret chamber within the mansion, a white-haired man, completely naked, was soaking in an octagonal blood pool. His body was bound by eight blood crystal chains, connected to eight blood-colored stone pillars at the edge of the pool.
Chapter:

His appearance was handsome, with deep purple eyes, and it was Shi Chuankong.

"Clang..."

The sound of chains rattling echoed continuously, causing the surrounding eight blood-colored stone pillars to shake violently. The entire blood pool seemed to be boiling, with waves of blood surging and emitting rolling hot breaths.

Shi Chuankong, who was in the middle of it all, seemed completely unaffected. His body didn't even tremble excessively. Only his tightly furrowed brows and the sound of his gritting teeth revealed that he was enduring unimaginable pain.

However, all of this was voluntary, and it was even the result of a deal he made with Sha Xin.

"Fellow Daoist Li, the feeling of being pulled away by you is really uncomfortable..." After he said this through gritted teeth, a point of light on his chest suddenly lit up, and he had actually broken through a mysterious orifice.

...

As the saying goes, cultivation knows no age. In the blink of an eye, more than 800 years had passed.

In the crystal palace beneath the Great Xu Blood Lake, the Star Array was still operating. In the side hall next to it, there were rumbling sounds.

Inside the side hall, a humanoid monster covered in golden fur, with lightning wings on its back, bulging eyes, and green tortoise shell-like armor on its arms, was wantonly punching the palace walls.

Fortunately, the runes on the crystal walls emitted a brilliant light, releasing a vast star power that strongly blocked the monster's heavy blows, preventing the entire crystal palace from being reduced to ruins.

After the monster had been rampaging for three hours, its momentum gradually weakened and it slowly stopped.

As its movements became slower, the silver wings on its body disappeared first, followed by the green tortoise shells fading away one by one, and finally, all the golden fur disappeared completely.

After all the abnormalities disappeared, it finally transformed back into a human form, which was Han Li.

At this moment, his eye sockets were sunken, and he looked like he had lost a lot of weight. His hands were supporting him on the ground, his chest was heaving, and he was panting heavily. The sweat on his body turned into mist as soon as it flowed out, evaporated by the high temperature emanating from his body surface.

His entire body seemed to be shrouded in a layer of smoke, making him look hazy and unclear.

After a long while, he leaned against the wall and sat down. The raging True Spirit bloodline in his body finally stabilized.

"The True Spirit bloodline is not a star power after all. With just this Star Essence Blood Refining Technique, it's becoming increasingly difficult to suppress the bloodline eruption. If this continues a few more times, I'm afraid it will eventually burn all the essence blood in my body dry." Han Li frowned and sighed.

All the books in another side hall had been read by him more than ten times. Among all the techniques for cultivating the body, none of them could deal with this situation. Instead, it was in the books about puppet techniques that a method was mentioned.

However, Han Li had a strong aversion to this method and was unwilling to try it.

The content described in this method was to refine a powerful puppet, channel the True Spirit bloodline into it, and then draw fresh blood from elsewhere into one's own body to preserve one's life.

However, if this method were followed, the strength of the main body would naturally be greatly damaged. Although the resulting puppet would have extremely powerful combat strength for a short period of time, once the refined blood in the puppet's body was exhausted, it would also become useless.

Although Han Li was resistant, he also knew clearly in his heart that if it really came to this point, life was naturally more important than anything else.

During this period of time, Crab Daoist had awakened several times. Han Li took the opportunity to borrow some of his Origin Immortal Spirit Power and opened the Flower Branch Cave to check on the state of the sobbing soul.

The result was that although the Purple Yang Warm Jade had been completely exhausted, for some reason, the state of the sobbing soul had not continued to deteriorate. So, he followed Crab Daoist's teachings and temporarily sealed the sobbing soul using the puppet secret technique, planning to deal with it in the future.

In addition, Han Li had also inquired with Crab Daoist about the issue of the True Spirit Bloodline backlash.

After all, it was Crab Daoist who had advised him to choose to cultivate the Heaven Slaying Prison Technique. And when he used the advanced refinement method recorded in the technique to refine the True Spirit Bloodline, the backlash situation began to appear.

After pondering, Crab Daoist also only gave an answer that "it was probably that after completely refining the True Spirit Bloodline, the power of the bloodline was inadvertently amplified, resulting in the backlash situation."

Unfortunately, he was unable to provide a solution and only said to wait until he came out of seclusion before discussing it further. Then, he fell back into a deep sleep.

Although Han Li felt helpless in his heart, there was nothing he could do about it.

However, as things stood now, as long as he continued to cultivate the Heaven Slaying Prison Technique and strengthen his physical strength, while not using the Heaven Slaying Prison Technique, he could use the star power to suppress the outbreak of the True Spirit Bloodline, which still had a certain effect.

Therefore, he intensified his cultivation of the Heaven Slaying Prison Technique even more.

Currently, Han Li had already finished cultivating the second statue, opening up more than 900 mysterious orifices, and his strength was already comparable to that of E'wan in the past.

The reason why he was able to cultivate so quickly was partly due to the ingenuity of the "Heaven Slaying Prison Technique" and partly due to the massive amount of qi and blood stored in the Grasping Heaven Bottle. Of course, this crystal palace also played a significant role.
