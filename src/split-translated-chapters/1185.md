"What's going on?"

"Impossible!"

"How can a human have such a complex and vast True Spirit bloodline?" The Qingshen tribe leader exclaimed.

"We, the barbarian tribes, are influenced by our own bloodline, making it difficult to integrate other True Spirit bloodlines into our bodies. On the other hand, humans have a bloodline that doesn't conflict with True Spirit bloodlines, making it possible for them to integrate other bloodlines. But how can a human's body withstand such a complex and vast bloodline without collapsing?" The Manshan tribe leader raised an eyebrow, equally puzzled.

Li Qi, who had entered a meditative state, couldn't help but open his eyes again at the commotion.

"Truly a sight to behold..." He gazed at the extraordinary scene before him, sincerely praising.

...

Meanwhile, in the Barbarian Sacred Temple on the Mount of the Eight Wastes, two of the eight chairs that were originally empty were now occupied.

Bai Ze sat in his own seat, looking at the other occupied chair, where a large, black-robed man sat majestically.

The man's body was robust and imposing, but his clothes were tattered and worn, with holes and tears everywhere. He looked like a common beggar.

The man lifted his hood, revealing a face with sharp features and a beard that was gray and black. His eyes, which were slightly sunken, shone brightly in the dim light of the temple, giving off an air of weariness.

This was none other than the True Spirit King, You Tian Kuang Peng, who had just returned.

"Yue Men, I knew you wouldn't leave the Barbarian lands for long, but I didn't expect you to return so quickly." Bai Ze's face showed a rare, warm smile.

"Enough chatter, what's the point of suddenly opening the Blood Gate of the Asura?" Yue Men, the black-robed man, replied coldly.

"Do you know that the Heavenly Court is about to hold the Bodhi Banquet?" Bai Ze asked.

"What of it?" Yue Men raised an eyebrow, asking.

"I know you're still blaming me for what happened back then, but..." Bai Ze's expression turned hesitant.

"Back then, the Heavenly Court coveted Mo Yu's abilities and wanted to recruit him. Mo Yu refused, and we fought against the Heavenly Court. You used the Barbarian lands as leverage, forbidding us from engaging in an all-out war. As a result, Mo Yu died, and even Old Yuan's body was lost. We couldn't even find out where he fell. Now, even if the Heavenly Court makes another move, our people's hearts are scattered, and we can only go with the flow." Yue Men's expression turned cold as he spoke.

"Back then... it wasn't that I didn't want to engage in an all-out war, but Mo Yu saw the outcome of our conflict with the Heavenly Court and used his death to blackmail me, forbidding me from intervening..." Bai Ze's face showed a mixture of hesitation and difficulty.

Yue Men's expression changed as he heard this, and he fell into deep thought. He knew that Bai Ze's words were absolutely true.

"This matter, Old Yuan also knew, but he still chose to take action. I've been regretting it for all these years, but regret is useless now..." Bai Ze sighed heavily.

"Indeed, it's useless now." Yue Men sighed, standing up to leave.

"Chu Yan and Zhu Yan have also fallen, and the entire Barbarian lands are now left with only you, me, and Luo Hou." Bai Ze said.

Yue Men's body froze at these words, and he slowly turned back to face Bai Ze.

"Only us...?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

"The Blood Gate of the Asura has reopened, and the Barbarian Sacred Temple has reappeared. I've also found the bloodline descendants of the other True Spirit Kings, and they've entered the temple to inherit the remaining True Spirit bloodlines. They need time to grow." Bai Ze explained.

"You're worried that the Heavenly Court will discover your actions and take action against the Barbarian lands, and you want me and Luo Hou to come back and protect them?" Yue Men sat back down, his body slightly hunched.

"The Barbarian lands need you." Bai Ze's eyes locked onto Yue Men's, his voice firm.

"These years, I've been wandering in the outer realms, waiting for the day to return to the Barbarian lands. The Heavenly Court owes us a blood debt, and it will be repaid sooner or later." Yue Men's eyes narrowed, his aura becoming fierce and intimidating.

"That day won't be far off." Bai Ze murmured.

Just then, Yue Men's brow furrowed, and he looked at Bai Ze.

"Interesting, you're just in time to take a look." Bai Ze's eyes seemed to sense something, and he spoke up.

With a wave of his hand, a golden flame spread out before them.

In the flames, a figure appeared - Han Li, surrounded by a halo of True Spirit energy, his body radiating a dazzling light.

"A mere human, yet he possesses so many True Spirit bloodlines, including those of Old Yuan and mine?" Yue Men's expression turned surprised.

"Not just that, he also asked me for the bloodline descendants of Chu Yan and Zhu Yan earlier." Bai Ze's face showed a mixture of surprise and bitterness.

As he spoke, a small, white jade bottle flew out from Han Li's body, dissolving into the flames and releasing two droplets of blood that merged into a mist, which then merged into Han Li's charred body.
As the two true spirit bloods entered his body, Han Li's Twelve Transformations technique suddenly activated on its own, and his body burst forth with waves of blood-colored light. His body shape also changed involuntarily, transforming into a giant ape with white hair and red feet, and then into a giant tiger with a long tail and wings.

Yue Mian leaned forward, his eyebrows furrowed in concern. "If this continues, this child will likely explode and die."

But Bai Ze smiled and said, "The clever part is right here."

As he finished speaking, the various true spirit illusions surrounding Han Li flew back and re-entered his body, and a five-colored light burst forth from his body.

Han Li's body shape changed even faster, and he actually transformed into all twelve true spirit forms.

But as his body shape changed, his aura stabilized, and even his charred and blackened flesh began to recover under the influence of a red glow.

Yue Mian was shocked. "How is this possible?"

Bai Ze praised, "He must have cultivated a technique that specializes in refining true spirit blood. It's truly remarkable. Looking at his aura, he originally only lacked two true spirit bloodlines, and now he has completed them."

Yue Mian's eyebrows furrowed. "That person..."

Bai Ze smiled and said, "We've already investigated him. He's not our enemy, but rather someone who will give the Heavenly Court a headache."

Yue Mian's eyebrows furrowed. "So you intentionally allowed him to complete the blood fusion in the Savage Wilderness Fire, and also helped him refine his blood and flesh?"

Bai Ze nodded. "Not only that, but his technique for refining true spirit blood is something we can learn from. I allowed him to do this on purpose, so that the people of the Sixteen Savage Tribes can see what he's capable of. As for how much they can gain from this, it's up to their own abilities."

Yue Mian shook his head. "You're being too kind. Although I think this child is not bad, I don't think he'll be able to enter the Savage Wilderness Temple. That door is impossible for him to open."

Bai Ze disagreed. "I don't think so. When he made that request, it wasn't because he was being reckless or arrogant. It was because his bloodline reacted to the temple door. If not for that, he wouldn't have spoken up."

Just as Bai Ze finished speaking, Yue Mian suddenly gasped in shock. Han Li suddenly let out a loud roar, and his body transformed into a three-headed, six-armed demon shape. He charged forward, his body glowing with a dark light, and crashed into the second giant door.

The sound of " Boom, boom, boom" echoed through the air, and Han Li's body was blocked by the door. Unlike Liu Yue'er and the others, who had easily passed through the door, Han Li was unable to do so.

Yue Mian sighed. "In the end, he's just a human. The Savage Wilderness Temple doesn't recognize his bloodline."

Bai Ze's expression turned serious, and he waved his hand. The golden flames on the ground disappeared.

The people in the Demon Blood Gate looked at Han Li's back, and they couldn't help but laugh. But as they watched, they realized that Han Li was not giving up. He was still trying to open the door.

Just as they thought the commotion was over, a sudden change occurred. The golden flames surrounding Han Li burst forth with a five-colored light, and the twelve true spirit illusions flew out and landed on the copper door. They merged into the door, and the door's rough lines began to glow.

The people gasped in shock as the door began to open, and Han Li's voice echoed through the air. His six giant arms pushed against the door, and the door slowly opened, revealing a gap.

A dense blood mist poured out, and Han Li's eyes lit up with excitement. He transformed back into his human form and stepped through the gap.

The door closed behind him, and the people were left staring at the empty space in shock.

"He...he actually went in!" the Celestial Ape tribe leader exclaimed.

The others gasped in shock. "He went in, that human went in!"
