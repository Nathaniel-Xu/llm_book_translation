The Rebirth Hall Master glanced at him and said, "With your current situation, completing your cultivation is not a problem. Take these two volumes of techniques, they will be useful to you. On the day of your great completion, your spirit and soul will be whole, and you will no longer need to worry about going mad. However, after completing the seventh layer, your path of rebirth and immortality will be severed. Whether you want to continue cultivating or not, you should consider it yourself."

As he finished speaking, he waved his hand, and a stream of light flashed towards Han Li. Han Li looked down and saw that he had received a white jade slip, which contained the techniques of the last two layers of the Refining Spirit Technique.

Han Li bowed his head and said, "Actually, there is only one path in front of me, which is to continue cultivating. As for the future, if I were to become an ordinary person, perhaps I would have the opportunity to reincarnate. But for someone like me, a cultivator, once I have embarked on the path of cultivation, I may not have the opportunity to reincarnate in the future."

The Rebirth Hall Master smiled and said, "You are quite perceptive, knowing when to cut off attachments. In this world, only those who can see through this point can achieve a state of no-self and attain the ancestral realm."

The Rebirth Hall Master stopped speaking and stood silently, his eyes fixed on Han Li, seemingly hesitant. Han Li waited for a moment, then spoke up, "Disciple has a question, may I ask for your guidance?"

The Rebirth Hall Master nodded, "Ask away."

Han Li glanced at Jiao San and said, "During my time at the Nine Yuan Observatory, I saw a woman who was practicing the Rebirth Technique. Her appearance and demeanor were very similar to those of a friend of mine. May I ask, where is she now? Can I see her?"

Jiao San's eyes flickered, and he took a step back involuntarily.

The Rebirth Hall Master asked, "Are you asking if that woman is your dao companion, Nangong Wan?"

Han Li's heart skipped a beat, but he maintained his composure, "Yes, that's what I'm asking."

Jiao San took a deep breath and turned to Han Li, his eyes filled with a mixture of emotions.

The Rebirth Hall Master said, "The person you are asking about is indeed here, but she is not Nangong Wan. To be precise, she is not your Nangong Wan."

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he felt a surge of hostility towards the Rebirth Hall Master. Even though the Rebirth Hall Master had been kind to him and had given him the techniques of the Refining Spirit Technique, if the matter involved Nangong Wan, it was different.

Han Li had dedicated his life to cultivation, and he had given up many things. He had few attachments, but Nangong Wan was one of them. If he lost this attachment, he would no longer be himself.

Nangong Wan was his reverse scale, his bottom line, and the softest part of his heart.

Han Li said, "Since she is here, I would like to see her. Whether she is my dao companion or not, I will be able to tell."

As he finished speaking, a figure emerged from behind the stone stele with the words "Rebirth" inscribed on it. Han Li turned to look and saw a woman in a blue palace dress, with skin as white as jade and a face as beautiful as a goddess. Her features were familiar, and Han Li felt a sense of warmth and nostalgia.

But what surprised him was that Nangong Wan's aura had increased dramatically, and she had already reached the level of a Mahayana cultivator. Moreover, her expression was not one of joy at being reunited with him, but rather one of confusion, doubt, guilt, and regret.

Han Li turned to the Rebirth Hall Master and asked, "What have you done to her?"

Jiao San stepped forward and said, "Han Daoist, don't be angry. The Hall Master only helped her recover her memories from her past life."

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise, and he asked, "What do you mean by 'her past life'?"

As he spoke, he took a step forward, wanting to pull Nangong Wan back to his side. The Rebirth Hall Master did not stop him, and Jiao San also did not intervene.

Just as Han Li was about to grab Nangong Wan's hand, she suddenly took a step back and looked at him with a mixture of confusion and guilt.

Han Li's hand froze in mid-air, and he looked at Nangong Wan in shock, calling out, "Wan'er..."

Nangong Wan's eyes flickered, and she seemed to remember something. She looked at Han Li with a mixture of emotions, and her eyes sparkled with tears.

Just then, Jiao San called out, "Mother..."

Nangong Wan's eyes snapped back to Jiao San, and she stopped in her tracks.

Jiao San removed his black mask, revealing his true face.
Nan Gong Wan saw this and came to Jiao San's side, examining him for a moment before suddenly bursting into tears.

"You're Jiuzhen!" she exclaimed, looking at Jiao San's face with joy and wonder.

In the depths of her mind, she could feel the connection between them, the bond of shared blood.

Jiao San nodded heavily, tears streaming down his face as he wept silently.

Han Li's heart felt like it had been struck by a massive stone, sinking heavily as he turned to face the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth, his voice trembling with rage.

"What did you do to her?" he demanded.

"Nothing, I just restored her lost memories and cultivation," the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth replied calmly.

Jiao San had never seen Han Li's face contorted in such a way before, and his heart felt a pang of sympathy. He spoke up, "The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth used the Six Paths of Rebirth to help her recover her memories from her past life. She is my mother, Gan Rufeng."

"Gan Rufeng... what does she have to do with me? I only know she's my Dao partner, my wife, my Nan Gong Wan!" Han Li thundered.

At the same time, his body erupted in a brilliant golden light, and the Time Domain surrounding him suddenly expanded, a wave of golden energy surging out and forcing Nan Gong Wan and Jiao San to stumble backward.

But the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth remained unmoved, waving his hand to summon a beam of light that swept over Han Li, causing the Time Domain energy to recoil and return to his body, where it dissipated without a trace.

Nan Gong Wan heard Han Li's thunderous roar and felt her entire body shudder, as if the memories of two lifetimes were flooding into her mind at once. Her face contorted in agony, she collapsed to the ground, clutching her head in her hands.

Han Li saw this and felt his heart tighten, rushing to her side, but the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth beat him to it, supporting her back and gently stroking her forehead.

As a beam of light flashed over her, Nan Gong Wan's face slowly relaxed, and she slipped into a deep sleep.

"The memories of her past life have resurfaced, and she's not yet able to handle it," the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth explained, entrusting Nan Gong Wan to Jiao San's care.

Han Li's face twisted in rage, his fists clenched so tightly that his knuckles turned white. "What right do you have to restore her memories?" he demanded.

"Because she's also my wife, my only Dao partner," the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth replied calmly, his voice icy.

Han Li and Jiao San were both shocked by his words, their faces pale with astonishment.

"Jiuzhen, didn't you ask me before about your father, who he was and where he was?" the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth asked, his eyes filled with a deep affection as he turned to Jiao San.

As he spoke, he reached up and removed the black headscarf that had covered his face for so long, revealing his true appearance.

In that instant, the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth's aura vanished, leaving Han Li and Jiao San staring at him in shock.

The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth's face was ordinary, with deep-set eyes and a nose that was slightly too high. But what shocked Han Li and Jiao San was that his face was identical to Han Li's.

"Who are you?" Han Li demanded, his Time Domain surging open as he took a step forward.

He had experienced countless strange and fantastical things in his cultivation journey, but nothing had ever left him as shocked and bewildered as this.

His wife, his Dao partner, had suddenly become someone else's partner, and that someone else was identical to him.

This was no disguise or transformation technique, but a face that was genuinely identical to his own. No wonder he had always felt a sense of familiarity when looking at the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth.

"I am me, you are you, I am Han Li, you are also Han Li," the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth sighed, his voice low and measured.

"What's going on?" Jiao San asked, feeling his strength draining away as he stared at the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth in confusion, Nan Gong Wan still cradled in his arms.

"I am Han Li, but I'm a Han Li who has reversed time, gone back to the past, abandoned time, and cultivated the Wheel of Rebirth," the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth explained slowly.

Jiao San's face was a picture of shock, his eyes filled with confusion.

"You're Han Li, then... who am I?" Han Li asked, his voice trembling as he took a step forward, his finger pointing at the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth.

His mind was a jumble of thoughts, unable to calm down and think clearly. The scene before him was like nothing he had ever seen before, and yet, deep down, he felt a strange connection to the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth, a connection that went beyond words.

Even though their auras were completely different, that inexplicable bond was undeniable.
