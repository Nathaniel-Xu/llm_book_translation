Ancient and modern times, seeing the situation, only smiled faintly.

After speaking, he raised his hands, and two golden light waves continuously surged out from his palms, rushing towards the high sky.

The massive chaotic vortex was suddenly stirred by the golden light, and the gray light emanating from it grew stronger, pressing down on Li Yuanji and the others.

The five-colored light on the small bottle was immediately suppressed, shrinking continuously, like a firefly in the dark night.

"It's no good, we can't hold on..." Meng Po exclaimed, and the crowd was forced to retreat repeatedly.

Li Yuanji also couldn't help but sigh, his hard work and preparation ultimately unable to match Guo's deep and far-reaching plans.

Just then, a sudden change occurred.

A massive silver symbol suddenly appeared in the void behind Guo, and a silver virtual door suddenly opened.

Guo immediately sensed it, his brow furrowed, and he withdrew one hand, slapping it towards the void behind him.

The golden light in his palm surged, transforming into nine golden dragons, rushing towards the door.

In the silver door, a dark red light also surged out, colliding with the nine golden dragons.

A loud explosion shook the air!

The silver door shattered, leaving behind a massive black hole that lingered for a long time.

Almost simultaneously, two figures flashed out from in front of and behind Guo, one clenched his fist and the other stretched out his hand, attacking him.

Guo was unable to avoid, his body's golden light surging, and a golden light shadow resembling a law body suddenly appeared, covering his figure and withstanding the attack.

A loud explosion shook the air!

The golden light shadow shattered, and a massive golden cloud ring expanded, pushing the two attackers back 100,000 miles.

The golden cloud ring gradually dissipated, and Guo's figure reappeared, his chest heaving violently, and a hint of blood on his lips, revealing that he had been injured.

"It's actually you..." Guo said, one hand maintaining the activation of the great array, the other wiping away the blood on his lips.

Li Yuanji and the others felt the pressure suddenly ease, and they quickly looked towards the two figures that had suddenly appeared.

Upon seeing them, the crowd was shocked.

It was none other than the Devil Master and the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation, who had been previously eliminated by Guo.

The two of them were surrounded by a layer of light, able to resist the invasion of the great array, and their bodies did not have any law power overflowing.

"It seems that Guo doesn't seem to be surprised by our return?" The Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation asked.

"In this world, there are three supreme laws, and you two, although not at the peak of your respective great paths, are still closely following me. If you were that easy to deal with, it would be disappointing. However, I'm a bit puzzled by the two fake bodies you created, which were able to deceive me." Guo said with a smile.

"My fellow clansman, Shi Kongjie, has a puppet law that is considered one of the highest in the world. The puppets he created, infused with our law power, were able to deceive Guo, which isn't surprising." The Devil Master replied.

"Ah, I see. I previously thought you brothers were at odds, and you had already killed him. I didn't expect it to be a play you two were putting on. It's been a long time, and it's indeed been a waste of effort." Guo said with a hint of realization.

...

The Devil Domain, the originally majestic Night City, had already been destroyed by half.

The previous battle between the rebel army led by Crab Daoist and the orthodox army led by the Devil Master was actually quite brutal, and anyone who had experienced it wouldn't think it was a play.

In fact, the war wasn't a play at the beginning, and even the early stages of the battle weren't a play. It was only when the two sides were about to engage in a decisive battle that someone intervened, bringing a message that could stop the war.

This person was naturally the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation, and the message was naturally Guo's plan.

At this moment, in a secret room deep within the Devil Palace, Crab Daoist, with a pale face, was sitting cross-legged on a mat, his body's aura extremely low.

Even more shocking was that his left half, from his shoulder to his abdomen, had disappeared, merging into the void, clearly a result of overusing the puppet law power and being invaded by the heavenly law.

In front of him, Shi Chongkong stood with his hands tied behind his back, his face filled with worry.

Earlier, when Crab Daoist extracted law power from the Devil Master and the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation to create the two fake bodies, he was also observing from the side. At that time, Crab Daoist was also invaded by the heavenly law, but not as severe as it was now.

Just a moment ago, Crab Daoist, who was meditating, suddenly suffered a severe injury, and the heavenly law invasion became even more severe.

After a moment, Crab Daoist slowly opened his eyes, took a deep breath, and spoke.

"You don't need to worry, the destruction of the fake bodies earlier caused me to suffer a backlash." Crab Daoist said, seeing Shi Chongkong's worried expression.

"Uncle, what's the situation on the other side?" Shi Chongkong asked anxiously.
"It's hard to put into words..." Crab Daoist shook his head.

Just then, a strange fluctuation suddenly appeared in the void, and both of them felt a thread of law force emanating from their bodies, like silk threads being pulled into the air.

"What's going on?" Shi Chuan's heart skipped a beat as he asked.

"Guo or Jin has activated the great array, the situation over there is not good..." Crab Daoist's expression turned increasingly serious.

...

In the void outside the realm.

Han Li and Jintong were flying at incredible speeds, braving the heavenly winds, as they attempted to enter the Xian Realm through the remaining "windows" and then use the transmission arrays to reach the Middle Earth Xian Realm. However, they discovered that the transmission arrays leading to the Middle Earth Xian Realm, and even those nearby, were all malfunctioning.

After a series of attempts, Han Li decided to take Jintong on a journey through the void, just like Yue Meng had done before, to reach the Middle Earth Xian Realm.

As they flew at full speed, they suddenly felt an unusual sensation, and law force began to emanate from their bodies, disappearing into the void.

"What's happening?" Jintong's figure halted, and he exclaimed in surprise.

Han Li noticed and, after a moment of contemplation, slowly said, "I fear something has changed in the Heavenly Court..."

He then activated his spiritual energy to try and seal off his law force, but to his surprise, he found that it was impossible to stop.

"What can we do? If this continues, we won't make it to the Heavenly Court, and..." Jintong's words trailed off as he noticed a green glow emanating from Han Li's chest.

Han Li also sensed the change in the small bottle and quickly retrieved it.

The leaf-like patterns on the bottle shone brightly, releasing a gentle light that enveloped Han Li's body, and the golden light emanating from him disappeared.

"It's stopped," Jintong exclaimed.

Han Li hesitated for a moment before releasing a beam of light that connected him to Jintong.

The light enveloping Han Li's body spread to Jintong, wrapping him in its radiance, and the law force emanating from him ceased.

"It seems the small bottle can resist this strange change, but I'm not sure if it's temporary or permanent. We must hurry to the Heavenly Court," Han Li said gravely.

Jintong nodded, and the two of them flew off together, disappearing into the distance.

...

In the Middle Earth Xian Realm, on the continent of Qitian.

The Dragon Ascending Peak of the Bu Tian Sect was still desolate and quiet.

However, the ancient peach trees on the peak, which had been flourishing, suddenly withered and shed their leaves, as if they had been battered by a fierce storm.

Without the mist to conceal it, the Dragon Ascending Peak's summit appeared bare and rugged, making the eight-sided black stone altar at its center stand out even more.

The black vortex hovering above the altar continued to churn, and the ancient face embedded in it, now only half-remaining, seemed eerie and terrifying.

"There are three thousand ways to divine the Dao, but it's hard to predict the heavens..." a hoarse voice echoed through the void, resonating across the mountain peak.

Chen Yun's blind eye scanned the scattered petals, gazing out at the distant mountains, and finally, he looked up at the sky, his expression filled with worry and hesitation.

"Never mind, I've lived for so long, but I've never dared to divine this particular fate. With only half of the Dao's opportunity remaining, I wonder if I can still divine the future... Ha ha, it's all up to fate now," Chen Yun sighed, his voice laced with sorrow.

He had given up on knowing the outcome of the Bodhi feast, and now he only wanted to know what the future held for Guo or Jin.

As he spoke, his mouth began to murmur an incantation, and his blind eye suddenly burst forth with a blood-red glow, piercing the void in front of him.

The void distorted, forming a black vortex that absorbed the glow, creating a blood-red "bridge" between Chen Yun and the void.

However, the old man, who had reached the pinnacle of divination, had finally exhausted his energy.

The bridge had barely formed when it collapsed, and the black vortex flew back towards Chen Yun, merging with the vortex behind him, slowly devouring his remaining life force.

"I didn't expect it to be like this..."

Chen Yun's final words echoed through the heavens.

In an instant, the ancient peach trees on the Dragon Ascending Peak spontaneously ignited, sending black smoke billowing into the sky, as if a dragon had risen from the peak and disappeared into the heavens.
