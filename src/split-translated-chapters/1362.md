Here is the translated text:

“After all, it's still a struggle for the Great Way... But it's also similar to the entanglements of the past life. The Palace Master has now turned to comprehend the cycle of reincarnation, and should be more aware that such struggles are unavoidable. And now, the connections between us are not many, and the struggle for the Great Way has already ceased. Why not put down our grudges? I can help you reach the pinnacle of the cycle of reincarnation, and rank among the Seven Lords. How about it?” Gu Huo Jin sighed and said.

“For you, it's just a matter of the past, and even the memories don't exist. But for me, it's a real and painful experience, branded into my bones, and even scraping my bones won't erase it. Moreover, the grievances between the Heavenly Court and the Cycle Palace have already involved countless people, and it's not just between you and me. This karma is impossible to cut off.” The Palace Master shook his head and said.

“Then, according to the Palace Master's intentions, what do you plan to do?” Gu Huo Jin seemed to have expected the Palace Master's response, and asked slowly.

“Only when we make a decisive move, and one side completely disappears from this world, can we achieve true peace.” The Palace Master's eyes locked onto Gu Huo Jin, and he spoke in a measured tone.

“Although we have been struggling with each other, I have always considered you a friend. Because your methods have often surprised me, I have always regarded you as a fellow traveler. Now, it seems I was wrong. Your understanding is still too shallow.” Gu Huo Jin's face showed a hint of disappointment, and he spoke slowly.

The Palace Master simply gazed at Gu Huo Jin, without speaking, as if waiting for him to continue.

“Your dao companion's death, our struggle for the Great Way, even the countless lives and deaths of the Heavenly Court and the Cycle Palace's cultivators, are all just trivial matters under the Heavenly Way. Haven't you thought about what's above the Heavenly Way, something higher than the Heavenly Way?” Gu Huo Jin's sleeves fluttered, and his clothes rustled, as he revealed an air of confidence.

His words were spoken with great momentum, and anyone who heard them would feel a sense of reverence.

“Contending with the Heavenly Way? As the Master of the Time Law, and the leader of the Seven Lords, you have already reached the pinnacle of the world's cultivators. Are you still not satisfied?” The Palace Master smiled, and spoke in a calm tone.

“You don't understand me, which is not surprising, since you are not a true Dao Ancestor. You can't feel the suffocating pressure of the Heavenly Way, that feeling of wanting to punch through it.” Gu Huo Jin pondered for a moment, and then clenched his fist.

The people present were all taken aback, and it was clear that they had never seen Gu Huo Jin speak like this before. Today's Gu Huo Jin seemed different, very different.

“Is the strong one without limits? Haha... You've finally revealed your ambition? Unfortunately, I won't be able to see you contend with the Heavenly Way, and you won't be able to see it either.” The Palace Master suddenly burst out laughing.

As soon as he finished speaking, a sudden change occurred!

The void around the Jade Pool suddenly shook violently, and countless chaotic silver waves appeared, stirring the void like boiling water.

The entire Jade Pool was already surrounded by the powerful seals of the Heavenly Court's Dao Ancestors. At this moment, the various seals and lights containing powerful energy emerged, and clashed fiercely with the silver waves.

The silver waves' energy was extremely powerful, and the Jade Pool's seals were at a disadvantage.

A series of thunderous powers surged into the Jade Pool, and the guests on the periphery were directly blown away. Some cultivators with weak cultivation were severely injured, and their cries of pain filled the air.

At this moment, white clouds flashed on either side of the Jade Pool, and a large amount of white cloud energy appeared, blocking the silver waves.

The turbulent silver waves were suddenly stopped, and the powerful energy surged into the cloud energy, but it was like a mud cow entering the sea, without any effect.

A white shadow flashed above the Jade Pool, and the White Cloud Dao Ancestor appeared.

The injured cultivators narrowly escaped death, and hastily flew towards the central area of the Jade Pool. The scene was chaotic.

By the side of the Clear and Bright Lake, Li Yuanji and the other Dao Ancestors saw the scene, and their expressions changed. They all looked at Gu Huo Jin and the Palace Master.

Gu Huo Jin sat on the high platform, his expression unchanged, as if he was not interested in the scene before him.

The Palace Master also remained silent, as if the events around him were of no concern to him.

Seeing this scene, Li Yuanji and the Chi Rong Dao Ancestor exchanged a glance, and it was clear that they were thinking deeply.

Chen Ruoyan's lips curled into a faint smile.

The Yinming Dao Ancestor closed his eyes, as if he was in a state of meditation, without any reaction.

The other Dao Ancestors looked at Gu Huo Jin's face, and their expressions were different. Some looked puzzled, some furrowed their brows, some observed, and some retreated quietly.

The White Cloud Dao Ancestor's gaze flashed, and his hands moved without hesitation. He pointed with his finger.

Countless white clouds emerged from the void, and covered the silver waves on either side.

The various seals in the nearby void also burst forth with light, and combined with the White Cloud Dao Ancestor's summoned cloud energy, they fiercely suppressed the silver waves.

But the silver waves' energy suddenly surged, and two powerful forces burst forth, sharp and piercing.

“Hiss!” The White Cloud Dao Ancestor's body shook violently, as if he had been struck by lightning. He retreated over a dozen steps before stabilizing his body.

In front of everyone, the White Cloud Dao Ancestor's face turned purple with anger, and he prepared to make another move.
The two sides of the Jade Pool flashed with silver light once again, and the void directly split open, revealing two spatial channels that floated out, dark and bottomless.

Countless figures flew out of the spatial channels, landing on both sides of the Jade Pool, their numbers unknown, a dense and oppressive crowd, with banners fluttering in the wind.

The people on the left side of the Jade Pool were all dressed in purple-black robes, emitting a rolling aura of demonic energy, and were the army of the Demon Domain.

The leader was a middle-aged man with a refined and elegant appearance, but with a stern and awe-inspiring expression, and was none other than the Demon Master, Shi Kong Yu.

Shi Kong Yu was wearing a set of purple armor covered in black patterns, with a blood-red cloak fluttering behind him, emitting an endless aura of power.

He was flanked by four people.

On the left were a pair of men and women, the man with a head of dry, yellowish hair and a body that was as thin as a skeleton, giving off an aura of evil and malevolence.

The woman was beautiful, with a slender waist and full hips, every movement she made exuding an aura of seduction and evil, as if she was a blooming flower of evil, making people feel both fearful and attracted.

On Shi Kong Yu's right stood two people, one of whom was a white-robed woman, tall and imposing, with a body that was extremely fat, her eyes reduced to a slit by the fat on her face, and her neck filled with layers of fat, making her look like a mountain of flesh.

The other person was a young man in yellow robes, who looked only in his twenties, with a black sword at his waist, and an ordinary appearance, but with eyes that were extremely dull and lifeless, without any sparkle.

If one had to describe his eyes with a single word, it would be "death".

The four people's auras were all unfathomable, and they were all clearly Dao Ancestors.

Behind them stood dozens of people, all of whom were at the level of the Great Luo, with auras that were deep and profound.

The Third Prince, Shi Po Kong, and the Fifth Princess, Shi Jing Yan, were among them, both of whom had reached the level of the Great Luo, but were still at the early stage.

Next to them stood another young man in imperial robes, who had a handsome face and a full beard, with an aura that was extremely powerful, and had reached the level of the Great Luo.

Behind them was the army of the Demon Domain, all of whom were at the level of the Golden Immortal or higher, and were clearly the elite of the Demon Domain.

On the other side of the Jade Pool, the people's auras were wild and untamed, and were the True Spirits of the various tribes of the Savage Realm.

The three people standing at the front were the Bai Ze, Yue Mian, and a middle-aged man with a shaved head, who had a smiling expression on his face.

The middle-aged man was wearing a set of ancient bronze armor, with no spiritual patterns or designs, and looked like a ordinary suit of armor, but when worn by him, it gave off an aura of dominance and power, that was not inferior to the Bai Ze and Yue Mian.

Behind them stood dozens of people at the level of the Great Luo, including the leaders of the other tribes of the Savage Realm, and the likes of Li Qi Ma, Xiao Bai, and Liu Le Er.

The army of the Savage Realm, was also the elite of the various tribes, and had all come out to surround the Jade Pool.

...

At the same time.

In the unknown realm, the Ten Directions and Hundred Sages' Great Array.

Han Li's sleeves fluttered, and a golden light burst forth from his sleeves, as 72 bamboo swords flew out, like two golden dragons charging forward, shooting straight at the four figures that had just appeared.

The golden lightning that struck the void caused it to shake and tremble, and the ripples of the lightning were thousands of feet wide.

The four people, with one of them standing at the front, were in a state of rapid movement, like a tiger, and blocked the way for the others, their hands clasped together, and then suddenly thrust forward.

Their clasped hands were like a sharp sword, splitting the void on either side, and a golden light burst forth, revealing a giant mountain peak that was thousands of feet tall, although it was not a real mountain, it had a majestic aura.

A golden mountain peak suddenly appeared, and the two golden dragons struck it, but were unable to pierce through, and instead carved out two large holes on either side of the mountain, and slid to the sides.

The golden dragons, after failing to strike, flew into the distance, and dispersed, turning into 72 sword spirits, each wrapped in golden electric threads, floating in the void.

The sword spirits, each with their arms crossed, looked at the four people, seemingly not in a hurry to attack, or to set up a formation.

"Four Dao Ancestors arriving at the same time, Han Li is deeply honored." Han Li stepped forward, his hands behind his back, and his feet treading the void.
