"City Lord E, we are just evenly matched. You plotted against us first, and my actions were just self-defense," Chenyang said calmly, meeting E's gaze.

"Xiāo Xīn, even if you were planning to get rid of me, I'll still advise you, given our past relationship. The matter of obtaining the Holy Remains is a win-win situation. Without me, even if you find the Holy Mausoleum, you won't be able to get the Holy Remains," E said, turning his gaze to Xiāo Xīn.

"I know the truth about what happened back then. Actually, the main reason I wanted to cooperate with you and enter this Grand Tomb was to kill you," Xiāo Xīn replied with a cold smile.

E snorted in response but didn't say anything.

"How did E come out? According to what you said earlier, he should still be inside the Weeping Blood Array?" Xiāo Xīn glanced at the blood array beside her and raised an eyebrow, turning to Chenyang.

"An unexpected turn of events occurred, which I didn't anticipate either. The Grand Hall is surrounded by a barrier that prevents me from sending a message," Chenyang replied with a bitter smile, glancing at Han Li inside the blood array.

E overheard the conversation between the two, and his heart skipped a beat.

If he was still inside the array when the lightning struck, he would have been unable to defend himself effectively, and he might have been struck dead on the spot.

Luckily, Li Feiyu appeared, allowing him to exit the array.

As soon as he thought of this, E's hatred towards Han Li decreased significantly, and his mind quickly turned to thinking of a way to retreat.

"E, you have some good fortune today, but you're heavily injured. Prepare to die!" Xiāo Xīn didn't give him any chance to catch his breath, her eyes shining with a fierce killing intent as she raised her hand.

A gold-colored sphere the size of a fist flew out of her sleeve, making a cracking sound as cracks appeared on its surface. A large amount of golden light burst out from within.

The sphere quickly transformed into a golden, giant bird-shaped puppet, over ten zhang tall, resembling two golden eagles. Its broad wings spread out, also over ten zhang wide, with golden feathers on top, each one embroidered with intricate patterns that shone with a starlight glow.

The golden bird puppet looked elegant and noble, but it also gave off an extremely perilous aura.

"Golden Wing Hawk!" E's face changed drastically as he exclaimed.

Before his words had even faded, his figure suddenly sprang forward, his target clearly Xiāo Xīn.

E was severely injured, but his speed was still incredibly fast. He covered a great distance in a single flash, reappearing right in front of Xiāo Xīn.

A white longsword appeared in his hand, shining with a brilliant white sword light, its sharp tip almost instantly reaching a distance of just one foot from Xiāo Xīn.

Just as his sword was about to strike, a blurry golden shadow flashed by, and a golden wing appeared out of thin air, blocking the sword light and Xiāo Xīn.

There was a loud clang as the white sword light struck the golden wing, exploding into a burst of golden light.

The golden wing remained motionless, easily withstanding the attack.

Almost simultaneously, E's head was suddenly enveloped in a golden shadow, and another golden wing appeared out of thin air, striking down towards him like a giant golden knife with incredible speed.

The air around the wing vibrated violently, and the ground nearby cracked open, forming a deep gash.

E's pupils constricted as he swiftly dodged to the side, his other hand flashing with a white light as another longsword appeared, and he crossed his swords to slash down.

The two swords clashed, creating a massive explosion of light as the white and gold energies met and exploded.

A massive wave of gold and white energy surged out in all directions, causing the air to quiver and the ground to be scraped away.

The entire Grand Hall building shook violently, its structure creaking ominously.

E and Xiāo Xīn moved at incredible speeds, their exchanges happening in the blink of an eye, and the others could only react after the fact, hastily retreating to avoid the aftermath.

Han Li, who was inside the blood array, was also affected by the residual energy, and the array began to shake violently. He quickly cast a spell to stabilize it.

The white sword light shattered, but it also momentarily halted the golden wing's descent.

E's face turned red again as he spat out a mouthful of blood, but he had already retreated, his feet stomping the ground.

With a swift motion, he shot upwards like a black owl taking flight, aiming for a large hole in the ceiling.

E's speed was incredibly fast, and with the added momentum from the shockwave, he moved at an astonishing velocity, reaching the ceiling in an instant.

Just as he was about to exit through the hole, a golden afterimage flashed by, creating numerous residual images as it moved at a speed that surpassed even E's, instantly blocking his path.

E's body glowed with starlight as he forcibly halted his movement.

The Golden Wing Hawk's most formidable aspect is its speed. City Lord E, you won't be able to escape today. Surrender!" The Golden Wing Hawk's wings spread wide, and Xiāo Xīn stood atop it, her face twisted into a cold smile as her slender fingers moved, her fingertips radiating a faint, transparent thread.

As the bird's wings fluttered, its golden feathers glowed with an intense light, and the next moment, countless golden feathers exploded from its surface, emitting a blood-curdling shriek as they hurtled towards E like a dense, golden rain.

Each feather transformed into a blinding, golden light, leaving behind a long, glowing tail that resembled a golden meteor.
E Fu's face sank, seemingly extremely wary of the golden feathers. He let out a loud battle cry, and the double swords in his hand danced swiftly.

Innumerable white sword silhouettes appeared, densely packed, hacking towards the golden feathers.

However, upon contact, the white sword silhouettes crumbled upon touching the golden feathers, instantly pierced and shattered into fragments.

Meanwhile, the golden feathers merely slowed down slightly but continued to shoot down at incredible speeds, like lightning.

E Fu's face was strained taut; the Star Acupoints around his body shone with starlight, and his body spun like a top, creating a white whirlpool of starlight around him.

Nearby star energy surged towards him wildly, and rays of starlight poured in from the large holes in the roof, merging into the whirlpool.

The whirlpool instantaneously grew several times in size, spinning rapidly and releasing waves of intense tearing forces, which also stirred up the surrounding void, causing ripples to form.

As soon as the golden feathers entered the whirlpool, they were pulled away from their original trajectory, moving involuntarily with the whirlpool and their speed significantly reduced.

E Fu's double swords left arcs of light, hacking at the incoming golden feathers, splitting and sending them flying.

However, the power contained within the golden feathers was truly terrifying, and E Fu's body would involuntarily shudder each time his swords cut through one, and he would be blown backward.

A series of intense, earth-shaking booms erupted!

In an instant, all the golden feathers had been exhausted, and E Fu's body was severely struck, crashing to the ground, and creating a large crater.

The golden feathers that had been deflected or shot into the air mostly landed on the ground, while some struck the nearby walls.

Regardless of whether it was the ground or the walls, they seemed as fragile as tofu in the face of the golden feathers imbued with immense power, easily penetrating them.

The sound was like thunder, the shockwaves like knives, creating a maelstrom of explosive air that shook the entire great hall violently, as if it was about to collapse from the intensity of the two men's battle.

Xuan City's and Gui City's other cultivators retreated even further, their eyes wide with shock.

When the two City Lords clashed, they were like insignificant ants, unable to intervene, and if they failed to dodge in time, they might be affected.

The blood array was also struck by the golden feathers, but it wasn't damaged, and continued to function.

Inside the array, Han Li's expression kept changing.

E Fu was heavily injured yet still possessed such power; looking back, taking food from him was a desperate measure but also an extremely reckless move. If Sha Xin and the others hadn't appeared suddenly, Han Li's own situation would have been quite precarious.

As he pondered, E Fu leaped out of the crater, but the starlight surrounding his body had disappeared.

He spat out another mouthful of blood, his face deathly pale, his steps stumbling, and seemingly at his wit's end.

A golden shadow flashed, and the Golden-Winged Eagle appeared above E Fu.

"I said it before; you won't be able to escape today. I'll avenge my Master's enmity today!" Sha Xin's eyes were icy cold as she moved her fingers.

The Golden-Winged Eagle flapped its wings, releasing more golden feathers in a flash, amidst a piercing shriek.

E Fu's situation seemed extremely dire, yet he showed no signs of giving up. As he prepared to respond, eight silver lights shot out from beside him, each containing a silver ball, rapidly spinning above his head.

A loud "boom" sounded!

The eight silver balls burst with silver light, unleashing a swarm of silver runes, which rapidly condensed into a silver light array.

The array enveloped the surrounding area, covering several dozen zhang, and E Fu's figure was obscured within it. The array was filled with countless silver lights, which seemed to move like the rotation of the celestial spheres, mysterious and unfathomable.

Innumerable golden feathers pierced the silver light array, causing it to shake violently, but it didn't shatter.

Sha Xin's expression changed as she gazed at the scene, her eyes focusing on the direction the silver light had come from, but she saw no one, and coldly snorted.

The Golden-Winged Eagle swooped down, radiating golden light, and flapped its wings, shooting another barrage of golden feathers at the silver array.

Its sharp talons gleamed with golden light, as if they could pierce the heavens, and struck down.

Two enormous golden claws emerged, shining with an intensity that made it hard to look directly at them, and grasped the silver array, tearing at it violently.

The array finally shattered, releasing a blast of silver light.

Two figures shot out from the silver light: one was E Fu, and the other was Liu Hua Furen.

E Fu's face looked slightly better, seemingly having used some recovery technique within the array.

However, the two didn't charge towards the holes in the roof but instead shot towards a distant wall, where over ten golden feathers were lodged, the surface cracked and broken.

They fled, leaving the scene of intense battle behind, disappearing into the distance.
