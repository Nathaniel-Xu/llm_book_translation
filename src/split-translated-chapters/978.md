Han Li saw "Xiao Zi" in a perilous situation, and his pupils suddenly contracted.

The 475 Xuan points on his body all emitted brilliant light, and his body transformed into a white light, making a desperate dash towards "Xiao Zi" just in time, and a fist struck towards the black war knife.

However, at that moment, the direction of the falling black war knife suddenly veered, narrowly avoiding Han Li's fist, and struck towards his neck.

At the same time, the ancient beast phantom on the knife released a low, muffled roar, and a bloodthirsty mouth bit towards Han Li's head.

A massive, crushing pressure threatened to overwhelming Han Li, weighing heavily on his mind, and the light from his Xuan points also dimmed.

Han Li took a deep breath, and another fist flashed out, striking the black war knife, and the surface of his body suddenly radiated a brilliant golden light. A golden giant ape phantom materialized behind him, charging towards the black ancient beast phantom.

Two deafening sounds shook the air.

The golden, white, and black lights burst out, a three-way explosion.

The entire cave trembled with the force, and the massive shockwave attracted the attention of Sha Xin and E Mo.

The entwining three-way lights formed a vortex that shook and trembled.

A figure was flung backward, crashing into the cave wall, and it was indeed Shi Zhanfeng.

His black war knife was broken, the black patterns on his body had dimmed significantly, his mouth was bloody, and his eyes were filled with shock and dismay. He turned around and fled towards the cave entrance.

"Don't go!"

A "whoosh" sound, Han Li's figure burst out from the exploding lights, his face enraged, and his figure flickered, turning into a white light phantom in pursuit of Shi Zhanfeng. He caught up with Shi Zhanfeng in a flash, and a fist crushed down.

A brilliant white light exploded from his fist, causing the air around him to violently shake and tremble. Han Li's fist brought the void with him, crushing it towards Shi Zhanfeng.

Shi Zhanfeng was terrified, his body releasing a brilliant starlight, and the black patterns on his body glowing, forming a black crystal membrane once more.

At the same time, his hands opened, and a gray shield was launched from his sleeve, emitting the light of 30 star points.

With a "whoosh" sound, the gray shield expanded ten times, blocking his front.

Just as Shi Zhanfeng finished setting up his defense, Han Li's fist descended.

A crisp "tearing" sound, the gray shield shattered upon contact with Han Li's fist, shattering like paper.

Shi Zhanfeng was drenched in cold sweat, his hands raised, intending to do something.

But suddenly, his mind was pierced by a sharp pain, as if stabbed by an ice pick. He let out a dull groan, his entire body stiffening.

As Shi Zhanfeng's body became paralyzed, Han Li's white fist struck his chest.

The black crystal membrane on Shi Zhanfeng's body resisted Han Li's fist, but it quickly shattered. A "punching" sound was heard, and Han Li's fist perforated Shi Zhanfeng's chest, striking out a massive bloody cavity, as blood spurted out in all directions.

The next moment, Shi Zhanfeng's body was sent flying, like a falling rock, crashing into the ground near the entrance of the underground space.

A thunderous sound shook the ground, and the impact caused the ground to tremble, like ripples on water. Pebbles and dust flew everywhere.

Shi Zhanfeng spat out a massive amount of blood, his body cracking, his black patterns fading quickly, and disappearing in an instant.

"My Black King bloodline...this is the most superior, true spirit bloodline power...how is this possible..." Shi Zhanfeng, on the verge of death, gazed at his pale arm, his eyes filled with incredulity.

Han Li's gaze was icy, intending to deliver a fatal blow.

At that moment, a white light flashed from the entrance passageway, dragging a trail of frigid white light in the void.

A "punching" sound was heard, the white light piercing through Shi Zhanfeng's head, a white bone spear pinning his body to the ground.

Shi Zhanfeng's face was shocked, his eyes losing their luster, and turning a dull gray.

The sudden turn of events caused everyone in the cave to shift their attention.

Sha Xin's mouth curled into a cold smile.

E Mo's heart sank, Shi Zhanfeng was his man, and his killing spelled trouble. He had only Liu Hua Furen left, and their side was vastly outnumbered.

A thought struck him, and his heart quickened, the white light emitted by his Xuan points growing brighter, like burning white flames. The black light on his brutal dragon sword also intensified, cutting towards the tiger-shaped puppet.

Sha Xin's eyes watched the scene unfold, a finger pointing.

The tiger-shaped puppet's body glowed with golden light, expanding in size, then opening its mouth.

Countless golden blades shot out, forming a massive golden storm, sweeping towards E Mo.

E Mo snarled, his brutal dragon sword's black light intensifying, cutting through the golden storm.

A "tearing" sound was heard, the golden storm splitting in two, the brutal dragon sword slowing momentarily, before striking the tiger-shaped puppet.

A deafening sound shook the air, the tiger-shaped puppet being flung into the air, creating an opening in the four symbol war puppet's attack circle.
Sha Xin was shocked, and hastily controlled the other three puppets to respond.

However, after E Mo split the tiger-shaped puppet apart, not only did his movement not falter, but instead became even more fierce and vigorous, with the white light on his body becoming even more radiant. The barbaric dragon sword in his hand transformed into three massive black sword shades that slashed at the other three puppets.

Although the might of these three sword shades couldn't compare to the Heaven-Shattering strike earlier, they still managed to repel the other three puppets.

E Mo's body transformed into a white shadow and shot forward, looking as if he was about to break through the battle formation.

Just as he was about to, a silver shadow suddenly appeared, intercepting E Mo's path and blocking his way. It was a massive, seven-or-eight-zhang-tall silver giant ape puppet that clashed heavily with E Mo.

This sudden turn of events caught E Mo off guard, but he quickly retaliated by swinging his barbaric dragon sword sideways.

A black sword flash appeared, and the silver giant ape puppet was split in two with a hiss, but E Mo's movements also came to a pause.

Sha Xin saw this scene and was overjoyed, his ten fingers moving swiftly.

The four puppets immediately rearranged their formation and charged at E Mo once more.

In a flash of golden light, a dragon tail, a tiger claw, and a golden bird beak shot towards E Mo simultaneously, striking him in tandem.

E Mo let out a series of furious roars, and his barbaric dragon sword transformed into a ring of black sword light, shielding his body. However, he was still sent flying backward by the combined force of the attacks.

A figure appeared from the side and landed on the tiger-shaped puppet's back. It was Kun Yu, who had been blasted away earlier.

A massive hole had been blasted through his chest, but no blood flowed from the wound, which instead glowed with a metallic light. It seemed as though nothing had happened to him.

"Lord, you're injured, and controlling the four puppets alone is too exhausting. I'll take over the tiger-shaped puppet," Kun Yu said.

Sha Xin nodded in response, using a hand gesture to withdraw his control over the tiger puppet and hand it over to Kun Yu.

Although E Mo had been sent flying, he hadn't suffered any injuries. After stabilizing himself, he launched another attack.

However, now that Kun Yu was assisting him, the four puppets' strength increased greatly, and they were able to solidly block E Mo's attacks once more.

Meanwhile, Shi Chuan Kong lay paralyzed on the ground, but his gaze turned to Shi Zhan Feng's corpse, revealing a complex expression.

Liu Hua Furen gazed at the white bone spear, and her eyes lit up slightly.

"Who is it? Show yourself!" Han Li shouted, his eyes scanning the entrance. A intense killing aura erupted from his body.

"Hehe, it's me, Bone Qian Xun. Brother Li, please refrain from releasing such intense killing aura; I fear it may be too overwhelming for me," a white-robed woman walked in, laughing gently. It was indeed Bone Qian Xun.

"It's you? What brings you to this place?" Han Li raised an eyebrow.

"I simply stumbled upon this place by chance; I didn't follow you, Brother Li. In fact, I should thank you for your assistance; it helped me complete my mission," Bone Qian Xun said with a charming smile, as if she had anticipated Han Li's thoughts.

Han Li let out a soft snort but didn't press the matter further.

Even if Bone Qian Xun had been the one to kill Shi Zhan Feng, he was, after all, the crown prince of the Ye Yang Dynasty, and killing him would have meant endless trouble.

"Xun Er!" Liu Hua Furen's face lit up with joy when she saw Bone Qian Xun, and she hastened towards her.

Han Li's eyes observed this scene, and he vanished in an instant, only to reappear beside Shi Chuan Kong. A bright white light emanated from his hand as he struck Shi Chuan Kong's body.

"Stop!" Liu Hua Furen, who had seen this, cried out in alarm and turned around, but it was already too late.

A white glow enveloped Shi Chuan Kong's body, fluctuating with a series of dull sounds as he regained his freedom. He immediately leapt up.

"Many thanks, Brother Li, for saving me once again," Shi Chuan Kong bowed to Han Li.

Han Li casually waved his hand in response.

Liu Hua Furen, who had been watching from a distance of about a dozen zhangs, wore an expression of frustration, but a hint of cunning flashed in her eyes.

Han Li seemed to sense this, and he shot her a thoughtful glance before turning to look inside.

The three-colored light sphere had dispersed, and Xiao Zi's figure emerged from its center. However, she didn't continue to manipulate the puppets to attack. Instead, she stood there in a daze, her eyes gleaming with an unaccustomed spark, no longer as apathetic as before.

Han Li's heart stirred as he watched this scene.

Suddenly, the heart in his chest began to beat fiercely and, without warning, flew out from his bosom, transforming into a blood shadow that soared towards Bone Qian Xun.

Han Li's expression changed, and he gave chase.

Shi Chuan Kong, who had been watching from the side, followed closely behind Han Li.

Bone Qian Xun saw the heart flying towards her and, her face changing color, quickly dodged to the side.

But what happened next was unexpected!

The blood light didn't pay attention to Bone Qian Xun and, with a single flash, disappeared into the corpse of Shi Zhan Feng in the great pit.
