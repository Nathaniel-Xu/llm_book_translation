Han Li was urging his spiritual domain to move, thinking rapidly about how to escape.

Breaking through the time law's restraint surrounding him was not impossible, but the key was to figure out how Gu or Jin found his location, otherwise even if he managed to escape multiple times, it would be meaningless.

Because the pursuit from Gu or Jin would be endless.

Han Li's thoughts were racing, and he believed that he had not been directly tracked, and he was always careful, so he shouldn't have been caught by Gu or Jin.

Since that was the case, the problem shouldn't be with him.

Han Li looked at the Golden Boy beside him, and his mind suddenly flashed.

"I understand, Golden Boy, quickly expel the Xuan Yuan's law power from your body!" Han Li shouted to the Golden Boy.

The Golden Boy was taken aback, then suddenly realized, wanting to stop his attack, but looking at the golden giant palm in the sky, he showed a hint of hesitation.

"There's no need for you to intervene, I can handle it myself," Han Li shouted.

The Golden Boy nodded, stopping his attack.

Her body's light flickered, and she returned to her human form, sitting cross-legged, using all her strength to activate the Devouring Law, forcing the Xuan Yuan's law power out of her body.

Without the Golden Boy's help, Han Li's pressure suddenly increased, and his breathing became urgent.

He let out a low shout, and dozens of lightning sword shadows shot out from his body, landing in various parts of his spiritual domain.

In the midst of the thunderous roar, the lightning sword shadows instantly grew larger, transforming into dozens of lightning giant pillars, pushing against the golden giant palm, barely holding it back.

All of this seemed complicated, but in reality, it was done in the blink of an eye.

In the Heavenly Court, Gu or Jin saw this scene, and his eyebrows furrowed, just as he was about to act, the palace behind him suddenly shook.

Gu or Jin's face tensed, and he couldn't help but pay attention to the palace, waving his hands.

A series of golden lights appeared around the palace, rapidly intersecting and merging, forming a golden Taiji diagram that enveloped the palace.

The palace's tremors immediately began to subside.

In the spiritual domain below, Han Li took advantage of this brief moment of respite, and his face relaxed, turning to look at the Golden Boy beside him, but his eyebrows furrowed.

Although the Golden Boy had achieved the Dao Ancestor's realm, in terms of law power, Xuan Yuan, who had been in the Dao Ancestor's position for a long time, was still more powerful, and the speed of forcing out the law power was slow.

Han Li's hands formed a seal, and a series of golden lights shot out from his spiritual domain, landing on the ground near the Golden Boy, transforming into numerous golden patterns, forming a golden law array, similar to the Time Heaven's Great Array.

He then waved his sleeve, and the golden law array immediately activated, resonating with the surrounding spiritual domain, and the time flow speed within the array increased by nearly ten thousand times.

In the Heavenly Court, Gu or Jin continued to form seals and cast spells with one hand, suppressing the palace's turmoil, while his other hand pointed downwards, drawing a circle.

A deafening thunderclap echoed through the heavens, and a golden giant ring suddenly appeared near Han Li's spiritual domain, then contracted, tightly enclosing the golden spiritual domain.

A golden ring appeared at Han Li's waist, and he was also tightly bound.

A terrifying massive power seeped in, Han Li's shoulders sank, and his body felt as if it was being crushed by a giant mountain, becoming incredibly heavy, and his limbs were almost unable to move.

He looked up at the sky, and a flash of fire appeared in his eyes.

Was Gu or Jin trying to humiliate him, thinking that he wouldn't dare to counterattack?

Han Li's hands formed a seal, and a series of black patterns appeared on his body, rapidly spreading, covering his entire body in the blink of an eye.

A dark light burst forth from his body, and Han Li's body rapidly expanded, growing to a height of ten thousand feet, with twelve heads and thirty-six arms, transforming into a Heavenly Demon God.

A massive power erupted, impacting the golden ring.

But the golden ring, seemingly a divine ability, remained unmoving, and a powerful restrictive force emanated from it, attempting to limit the Heavenly Demon God's power.

The demon god let out a low roar, and the black patterns on its body suddenly hummed, becoming blindingly bright, and its eyes couldn't be looked at directly.

A massive power, combined with an extremely powerful time law, erupted, heavily impacting the golden ring.

The golden ring trembled, and a small gap appeared.

The thirty-six arms grasped the golden ring, and with a burst of power, the ring shattered, turning into countless golden lights that scattered.

The golden ring outside the spiritual domain also shattered, and the Heavenly Demon God regained its freedom, immediately leaping up and charging towards the golden giant palm.

The thirty-six arms glowed with golden light, and a series of golden patterns appeared, emitting a strong golden light, which harmonized with the surrounding black light, rather than conflicting with it.

The True Speech Treasure Wheel and other objects within the spiritual domain suddenly lit up, shooting out like lightning, and merged into the demon god's back, forming five golden patterns that surrounded it.

The demon god's thirty-six arms glowed with golden light, and a massive fist shot out, striking the golden giant palm.

A deafening sound echoed through the heavens, and thirty-six golden fist shadows shot out from the void, striking the golden giant palm with incredible speed.

Each of the thirty-six fist shadows contained the five time laws of the "Great Five Elements Fantasy World Seal", and they were all the "Great Five Elements Extinction Fist".
BOOM!

Thirty-six golden suns appeared under the giant palm, then exploded.

The golden giant palm was immediately engulfed by the suns, and countless golden lights swept out, causing the entire sky to collapse like a paper mache.

The shockwave spread out, quickly sweeping across the entire Corrupted Earth Domain, causing the domain to turn upside down. Several large continents collapsed, sinking into the ground, and countless magma and mud shot up into the sky, engulfing everything.

The nearby space was also shattered, and the restrictive power of the void disappeared.

Han Li saw this and was about to use his Thunder Sword to teleport.

But the golden light that had exploded in mid-air suddenly split open, and a golden hand descended from the sky, grabbing down with lightning speed. It was the same golden giant palm, but its surface was much dimmer.

Han Li's face changed slightly, and he realized that his previous attack had been his full strength, yet the golden giant palm seemed unscathed.

Although he was shocked, his movements didn't slow down, and he was about to cast a spell to counterattack.

Just then, Jintong suddenly opened his eyes and spat out a yellowish-brown light, containing a pure and unimaginable earth law.

The yellowish-brown light flew out of Jintong's mouth and shot up into the sky, quickly dispersing and merging into the void.

The golden giant palm that had been grabbing towards Han Li suddenly stopped, hesitated for a moment, and then changed direction to grab towards the yellowish-brown light.

Han Li was slightly stunned, but he quickly reacted and used his Thunder Sword to teleport.

He and Jintong disappeared in a flash of lightning, reappearing in a lush green forest.

Han Li's divine sense expanded, and the feeling of being suppressed disappeared.

However, to be safe, he didn't stay there and teleported several more times before stopping.

"It seems that we've finally shaken off Guo or Jin's pursuit," Jintong said with a sigh.

Han Li's face was calm, and he also felt a sense of relief.

He had been provoked by Time Daozu earlier, and after a brief battle, he had realized the vast difference in strength between him and Guo or Jin. He was grateful to have escaped successfully.

"Master, I've just advanced to the Daozu stage, and my cultivation is not stable. I plan to find a place to close up and cultivate, and then settle the score with Guo or Jin. What about you?" Jintong asked Han Li.

"Jintong, since you've already advanced to the Daozu stage, let's not use the term 'master' anymore. We can call each other Dao friends," Han Li said with a wave of his hand.

Jintong was still a bit hesitant.

"We're at the level of cultivation where we can't be bothered with trivialities. Besides, when have I ever really treated you as a spirit pet?" Han Li said with a smile.

"Since you've said so, I won't be polite. But what are your plans, Han Dao friend?" Jintong asked with a smile.

"I also plan to find a place to close up," Han Li said after a moment of silence.

The self-corpse that had appeared earlier was still a hidden danger, and Time Daozu had already set his sights on him. He needed to quickly increase his strength.

"That's great, Han Dao friend. You have the Accelerated Space, and I can take advantage of it," Jintong said with a joyful expression.

"Alright," Han Li nodded.

"Now that I've advanced to the Daozu stage, my memories have mostly recovered. Your cultivation has reached the peak of the Great Luo stage, and if I'm not mistaken, you're planning to use this opportunity to break through to the half-step Daozu stage," Jintong said, looking at Han Li with a serious expression.

"Not bad, I do have that intention. Is there anything wrong with that?" Han Li asked.

"Although it will increase your strength, it will also make you a thorn in Guo or Jin's eye," Jintong said gravely.

"I've already been cultivating time laws, and Guo or Jin has been eyeing me for a long time. Even if I give up now, he won't let me off the hook," Han Li said with a wave of his hand.

"Indeed, that's Guo or Jin's style," Jintong said with a bitter smile.

"I bear the legacy of my master, and I want to revive the True Word Sect. I'll eventually have to fight Guo or Jin to the death. And now, the Wheel of Reincarnation has attracted the attention of the Heavenly Court and Guo or Jin, making it a great opportunity for me to accumulate power and break through," Han Li said with a smile.

Jintong saw that Han Li had made up his mind and didn't say anything else.

Han Li looked around, and his eyebrows rose.

He was currently in a domain with a vast desert landscape, and his divine sense couldn't cover the entire area. The terrain was mainly sandy, but the heavenly and earthly energies were very dense, especially the earth attribute energies.

There were many fortress-like cities built in the desert, each with its own unique features.

"It seems I've arrived at the Yellow Sand Domain," Han Li said to himself, his face filled with surprise.

The Yellow Sand Domain was one of the 500 middle domains of the True Immortal Realm, known for its endless yellow sand and unique landscape. It was also famous for producing many earth attribute materials.

However, Han Li's surprise wasn't because of the Yellow Sand Domain itself, but because of its location, which was close to the Black Earth Domain and not far from the North Cold Domain.

He had unknowingly arrived here after his previous escape.

Han Li's eyes scanned the area, and he soon found a suitable place to close up and cultivate.
