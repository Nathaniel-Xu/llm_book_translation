Miaofa Xianzun's body suddenly shook, and a mouthful of blood sprayed out. She stumbled and fell towards the lotus throne below.

The blue sword rain in the sky suddenly stopped, and all the mist dissipated.

Miaofa Xianzun had not yet stood up when a silver flame suddenly erupted from the lotus throne, forming a giant fire lotus that tried to engulf her.

Luckily, she reacted quickly and dodged to the side, narrowly avoiding the silver fire lotus.

The silver fire lotus failed to hit her and transformed into a silver flame bird, which pounced towards her.

Miaofa Xianzun quickly raised her hand to summon her blue sword, but instead of just the sword, a young girl, Jintong, fell from the sky, holding the sword tightly in her hand.

"How is this possible?" Miaofa Xianzun exclaimed in shock.

Just then, Han Li appeared behind her, his shadowy figure floating into view, and stabbed her chest with his sword.

"Zzzt!"

A burst of electricity crackled, and countless lightning crystals erupted from Miaofa Xianzun's wounds, causing her to let out a blood-curdling scream as her face turned pale.

"You thought Jintong was hiding underground, so you let your guard down, but she was actually hiding in the sky," Han Li said slowly.

"She can't...can't control my Xuanfeng Sword," Miaofa Xianzun spat out a mouthful of blood.

"Who wants to control your broken sword, anyway?" Jintong retorted, tossing the sword at Miaofa Xianzun's feet.

The sword landed with a clang, and Miaofa Xianzun's face changed color as she gazed at it in dismay.

The sword's blade was now chipped, and it was clear that someone had bitten off a piece of it.

"Ugh, that's so cold!" Jintong rubbed her hands, which were frozen from holding the sword.

"I underestimated you this time, but next time, I'll make you pay back a hundredfold," Miaofa Xianzun snarled, her face twisted in anger.

Jintong glared at her, about to curse, when Miaofa Xianzun's body suddenly froze, encasing Han Li and his sword in ice.

A blinding blue light erupted from the ice, and a massive explosion shook the air, sending blue crystals flying everywhere.

After a while, the crystals finally settled, and the surrounding area was transformed into a snowy landscape.

Han Li and Jintong reappeared, scanning their surroundings, but Miaofa Xianzun was nowhere to be seen, and the lotus throne and Xuanfeng Sword had vanished.

"She got away," Jintong said, annoyed.

"It's okay, we didn't plan to fight her to the death. You played a big role in forcing her to retreat," Han Li said with a smile, instinctively reaching out to ruffle Jintong's hair.

But he quickly withdrew his hand, remembering that Jintong was no longer the little girl she used to be.

Jintong saw his awkward expression and smiled.

"Let's go back to the flower cave and rest. I need to catch up with Jiao San and the others," Han Li said.

"They've probably already gone far, thanks to Miaofa Xianzun's delay," Jintong said.

"They were chasing after them, leaving a trail of clues. I'll follow their tracks to find them," Han Li said, his eyes narrowing.

After a short rest, Han Li sent Jintong back to the flower cave and set off alone, following the trail of clues left behind by Jiao San and the others.

Han Li used his black mask's stealth ability to follow the trail, which led him to a large temple.

The sound of intense battle echoed from within, and Han Li's face changed as he hid behind a nearby boulder, gazing at the temple entrance.

He activated his Nine Yang Magic Eye, and a purple-black glow appeared in his eyes as he observed the temple entrance.
On the top of the two stone pillars, two transparent figures were attached, one was red and the other was black, which were Chi Meng and Huo Yuan.

The two were intently gazing into the hall, unaware of Han Li's arrival.

It was also because Han Li's black mask had an excellent concealment effect, that the two didn't notice.

Han Li glanced at the two and then ignored them, his body silently entering the ground, slowly moving towards the main entrance of the hall, and soon arrived at the front of the hall.

From this angle, he could see the situation inside the hall.

The hall was filled with flying artifacts, bursting spiritual light, and chaotic energy.

There were ten figures in the hall, five from the Wheel of Rebirth Hall: Tu Shou, Wu Yang, Lu Chuan Feng, Jiao San, and the black-robed woman.

The other five were from the Jiuyuan Palace: Chun Jun, Yang Jun, and Lei Jun, who had previously met Han Li.

Chun Jun was fighting against Tu Shou in mid-air.

Yang Jun and Lei Jun were sitting in a large formation, surrounded by a golden altar, and several golden statues stood around it.

These golden statues were wearing armor and holding giant swords, and they seemed to be alive, working in tandem with the surrounding formation to release a rainbow of golden light.

These golden lights seemed ordinary, but they contained extremely powerful golden attribute laws, and were evenly matched against Wu Yang, Lu Chuan Feng, Jiao San, and the black-robed woman.

At the top of the golden altar, a dazzling golden cloud floated, and it seemed to contain a treasure, but the cloud was too dazzling to see clearly.

The golden cloud seemed to be alive, and it was emitting a powerful spiritual energy, occasionally releasing a golden light that contained a sharp golden law, which could easily cut through the surrounding void.

Moreover, the golden cloud flashed several times, and its color suddenly changed to yellow, and the law energy it emitted changed to a thick and heavy earth law, causing the surrounding void to tremble.

The next moment, the cloud changed to green, and it released a dense wood law energy, filling the void in the hall with a vibrant vitality.

The cloud continued to change, turning red, blue, and other colors, and then repeated the cycle.

The five people from the Wheel of Rebirth Hall were staring at the cloud, launching various attacks while charging towards the altar from all sides.

The three people from the Jiuyuan Palace were struggling to resist, blocking the Wheel of Rebirth Hall's people from approaching.

The battle had reached a climax, and it was unclear what kind of powerful restriction was in place in the hall to withstand the aftermath of the battle.

"What treasure is inside the cloud, that it contains the power of five laws?" Han Li looked at the cloud in surprise.

The higher the grade of the artifact, the more it emphasized the purity of the law.

The energy emitted by the cloud was extremely powerful, surpassing all the artifacts Han Li possessed, even the Years of God Lamp, and it contained five laws.

He thought for a moment, and then cast a spell to project the scene into the flower branch space, letting Jin Tong, Ti Hun, and others see it, and asked.

"Jin Tong, Ti Hun, Xiao Bai, have you seen such a treasure?"

Jin Tong and Ti Hun were also shocked, and they shook their heads.

Xiao Bai had a hesitant expression.

"Xiao Bai, do you know something?" Han Li asked, noticing Xiao Bai's expression.

"I inherited my father's bloodline power, and also inherited some of his memories, in those memories, I saw the White Emperor and my father trying to refine an artifact, that artifact also contained different laws, but unfortunately, they failed. However, my father's memories didn't have a detailed description of the artifact." Xiao Bai said.

Han Li listened to this, and nodded slowly. He looked at the cloud for a few more moments, and then turned his gaze to the battle in the hall, focusing on the black-robed woman and Tu Shou.

The black-robed woman's cultivation had reached the early stage of the Mahayana, and her body was surrounded by a dark red aura, which was divided into six layers, like a rainbow.

She was wielding an ancient dark red mirror artifact, and fighting against four or five golden statues.

The dark red mirror was unknown, but its power was shocking, and it constantly released dark red crystal lights.

The golden statues' attacks were like ice and snow meeting fire, and they immediately dispersed and disappeared, and the statues were at a disadvantage, constantly retreating.

"The law of reincarnation!" Han Li looked at the dark red aura surrounding the black-robed woman, and his eyes flashed.

However, the law of reincarnation emitted by the black-robed woman was different from Jiao San's.

Jiao San's law of reincarnation was extremely fierce, with a strong and hard feeling, but the black-robed woman's law of reincarnation was more unpredictable.

Wu Yang, Lu Chuan Feng, and Jiao San were also using their divine abilities, fighting against the golden statues, and they were all at an advantage.

But the golden formation around the altar was extremely powerful, and it was connected to the Jiuyuan Palace, constantly supplying a stream of golden attribute laws, and Yang Jun and Lei Jun's control over the golden statues was extremely skilled, so the black-robed woman and others were unable to defeat the statues.
