Heavenly Crane Domain.

The cave dwelling hidden in the nameless mountain range had been sealed off for hundreds of years.

In the cave's side chamber, the Purple Spirit, dressed in a purple robe, sat cross-legged on a stone bed, regulating her breath.

Her stable Taichi Peak realm had persisted for many years, but she was still stuck in the bottleneck period, unable to progress further.

Just then, she was suddenly disturbed while meditating, and her eyes snapped open.

Her gaze turned to the other side of the chamber, and a hint of joy flashed across her face.

Immediately, a loud rumbling sound echoed, and the large stone door of the opposite chamber opened. A tall figure, slightly bowing his head, walked out of the door, smiling warmly at her.

The Purple Spirit stood up from the stone bed, sizing up Han Li from head to toe, and her heart skipped a beat. A hint of incredulity flashed across her face.

"This is only a short time, a few hundred years, and your aura..." she said, pausing for a moment.

"I've just exited seclusion, and my aura is still somewhat unstable. It will stabilize in a few days," Han Li replied with a smile.

"I'm talking about your realm," the Purple Spirit said, her eyes filled with concern.

"It's indeed the Great Luo Peak, don't worry, I'm not one to rush for quick gains or use shortcuts. My cultivation method is just a bit unusual, and this realm was achieved through hard work, not by relying on external help," Han Li said, walking forward and grasping her hand.

"That's good," the Purple Spirit nodded.

As she spoke, her expression turned melancholic again. Han Li's cultivation had advanced to such an extent that it meant he would likely return to the Nether Realm soon.

Han Li noticed her change in expression and was about to ask when his brow furrowed, and his face changed slightly.

"What's wrong?" the Purple Spirit asked, noticing his expression.

Han Li shook his head, and his hand turned, revealing a black mask from the Wheel of Reincarnation. He put on the mask, raised his hand, and pointed to the mask's brow.

The mask's surface lit up with symbols, and a faint glow emanated from the brow, casting a shadow in front of him. A tall, slender figure emerged from the darkness, dressed in a black robe, wearing a hat with a veil.

The figure's aura was extremely repressed, but he was unmistakably the Master of the Wheel of Reincarnation.

As soon as Han Li saw the Master, he knew something had happened and immediately asked, "What's going on?"

"As for Gan Ruoshui, she was kidnapped by the Heavenly Court," the Master replied after a brief hesitation.

Han Li's expression changed beneath the mask, and he asked, "What's going on? What happened to Wan'er?"

The Purple Spirit's expression also changed upon hearing the news.

Earlier, Han Li had not hidden the truth from her, and she knew about the Master's identity and that Gan Ruoshui was actually Nangong Wan'er.

"After you left the Nether Realm, Ruoshui woke up not long after, but she still didn't choose to become my wife. Instead, she insisted on becoming Nangong Wan'er again," the Master explained.

Han Li's eyes flashed with a hint of heat, and he asked, "Why was she kidnapped by the Heavenly Court? You're not capable of resisting the Heavenly Court, so why did you let her get into trouble?"

"After you left, she initially planned to find you, but she was worried about becoming a burden to you, so she didn't leave immediately. I also didn't let her leave, as I was worried about her safety. However, the Wheel of Reincarnation lost all contact with you, and even the mask couldn't reach you. Recently, she was worried about your safety and left the Nether Realm to find you during my seclusion. As a result, she was caught by the Heavenly Court," the Master replied.

"Have you found out where she is?" Han Li asked, his eyes narrowing.

"No, the Heavenly Court has kept this matter secret, making it difficult to find her. However, not long after she was caught, Gu Huo or Jin sent a message, asking me to personally go to the Central Plains Heavenly Domain. If I agree, they promise not to harm her," the Master said.

Han Li fell silent.

He knew that the Heavenly Court had long been at odds with the Wheel of Reincarnation, and if the Master fell into their hands, the consequences would be dire.

"I've already agreed to Gu Huo or Jin's request. I won't continue to hide and will go to the Central Plains Heavenly Domain as promised," the Master said.

"When will you depart?" Han Li asked.

"I need to prepare first; otherwise, not only will I fail to rescue her, but all our previous efforts will also be wasted," the Master replied.

"I'll go with you," Han Li said without hesitation.

The Master hesitated for a moment before saying, "Very well, you can bring Ruoshui back with you. That way, I'll be more at ease."

The Master's words were laced with a deep sense of concern and responsibility.
Han Li said, "I'll take Nan Gong Wan with me. Before that, I have something to do. After I'm done, I'll go to the Underworld to meet up with you."

"Alright, I'll wait for you," the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation replied.

"Don't trust the Heavenly Court's words completely. If you can find Wan'er's exact location, that would be best. Think about it carefully," Han Li said.

"If I get any news, I'll let you know," the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation replied.

The two of them finished their discussion, and the light on Han Li's mask dimmed. The shadowy projection disappeared.

Zi Ling's expression was complex as she looked at Han Li.

Han Li opened his mouth to explain, but before he could, Zi Ling said, "Go ahead, rescue her."

"Let's go back," Han Li said.

"Where are we going back to?" Zi Ling asked in confusion.

"The North Cold Immortal Domain," Han Li replied, his eyes narrowing slightly.

...

On the other side, in the Underworld, a large hall.

The Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation, who had just finished communicating with Han Li, slowly walked down from the high platform.

At this moment, a figure hastily entered the hall, wearing a wide black robe, with thick bandages wrapped around their arms, neck, and face, and golden talismans drawn on top. They looked very unusual.

"Lord, I just received a prophecy that the Honored One of the Qiu Tian Immortal Domain will soon arrive at the Dun Yang Continent," the black-robed person reported in a hoarse voice.

"The Qiu Tian Immortal Domain is just a medium-sized immortal domain, and it doesn't have a direct transmission array to the Middle Earth Immortal Domain. He's probably going to the Dun Yang Continent to use their transmission array to go to the Xuan Tian Immortal Domain, which has a transmission array that can reach the Middle Earth Immortal Domain directly. Inform Feng Hui and Wu Jiang to ambush him at the Dun Yang Continent, and kill all his followers," the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation said.

"Yes, sir," the black-robed person replied, bowing.

"Yuan Chun Feng, how many years have you been following me?" the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation suddenly asked.

The black-robed person stopped and turned back, thinking for a moment before answering, "It's been too long, I've forgotten. Probably hundreds of thousands of years..."

"You use the Heavenly Calculations to divine for me, and see if I have a chance of winning if I go to the Heavenly Court ahead of time," the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation asked calmly.

"Lord, do you really want to calculate? With my current state, using the Heavenly Calculations once won't get me punished by the Heavenly Court, but afterwards, I'll be no different from a useless person. Besides, if it's related to the Time Ancestor, the Heavenly Machine... might not be able to predict it," Yuan Chun Feng replied calmly.

"If that's the case, then don't bother. I still need you to predict the paths of the various Da Luo cultivators going to the Bodhi Banquet, otherwise, it'll be like finding a needle in a haystack," the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation said.

Yuan Chun Feng didn't say anything else, and simply bowed again.

"You people from the Bu Tian Sect are clever, betting on both sides between the Heavenly Court and me," the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation said with a smile.

"Lord, you're joking. We're just forced to do this. You and the Time Ancestor are both at the top of the True Immortal Realm, and your conflicts have already surpassed the Great Dao, even affecting the Heavenly Court and disturbing the Heavenly Machine. We can't predict the outcome, so we can only do this," Yuan Chun Feng said.

"Chen Gong chose to bet on the ancient side, and as his disciple, you bet on our side. It seems you think the Heavenly Court has a higher chance of winning. But it's good that you're doing this, winning isn't necessarily a big win, and losing won't be a complete loss. At least, no matter which side wins, you'll be able to preserve your sect's legacy," the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation said.

"If the Heavenly Court wins, I'll be destroyed along with the Wheel of Reincarnation. I hope you won't let me lose," Yuan Chun Feng said, a glimmer of light flashing in his eyes from the gap in his bandages.

The Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation didn't respond, and simply nodded, indicating that Yuan Chun Feng could leave.

The latter slowly walked out of the hall, leaving the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation alone in the darkness.

...

Time passed, and two years went by.

In the North Cold Immortal Domain, at the edge of the Gu Yun Continent, a border city.

A figure descended from the sky, and Han Li and Zi Ling appeared, dressed in a blue robe and a purple dress, respectively.

They landed outside the city, and their bodies were surrounded by a layer of golden light, which isolated the gray mist in the air.

Han Li looked into the distance, gazing at the city wrapped in a layer of light, and a hint of nostalgia flashed in his eyes.

"When I first left the Black Wind Sea, I stayed in this city for a short time on my way to the Zhu Long Dao. Compared to my memories, this place has changed a lot," Han Li said.

"Now that the Gray Boundary is invading, not just the North Cold Immortal Domain, but also the nearby immortal domains, have been occupied. The world has changed a lot," Zi Ling said.

"This North Cold Immortal Domain has been mostly transformed by the Gray Boundary, and the original immortal cultivators have been forced to retreat to the cities. I think it won't take long before these places are completely conquered," Han Li sighed.

"There's nothing we can do. The Heavenly Court not only didn't send any reinforcements, but also suppressed the news. Not many people in the immortal realm know about this situation, so it's not surprising that it's not getting much attention. Fortunately, the Gray Boundary is being cautious, and has temporarily stopped expanding. Otherwise, the Heavenly Court might not be able to control the situation," Zi Ling said.

"I'm afraid this is just a tacit agreement between the Heavenly Court and the Gray Boundary. One doesn't expand too much, and the other doesn't suppress them immediately," Han Li said with a cold smile.

"Why is that?" Zi Ling asked.
