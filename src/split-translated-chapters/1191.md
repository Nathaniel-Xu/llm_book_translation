The powerful thunder law, at least it's a sixth-grade... no, a fifth-grade immortal artifact! Could it be that a senior in the Da Luo realm is refining an immortal artifact in the Five Lightnings Domain?" The black-armored ugly man and the red-dressed woman were shocked by the scene.

The thunder snakes seemed to be intimidated by the powerful aura of the 72 sword lights, stopping their struggles and looking towards the depths of the thunder domain.

"Senior, save us!" The black-armored ugly man and the red-dressed woman looked at each other, using all their strength to shout for help.

The thunder snakes were startled by the cry for help, and immediately began to roar again, struggling with all their might.

The silver threads wrapped around them suddenly snapped, and the thunder snakes broke free, pouncing towards the black-armored ugly man and the red-dressed woman.

The two of them saw the scene, their faces pale with fear, and closed their eyes waiting for death.

But at this moment, a golden light burst forth from the location of the 72 sword lights, expanding with a "pu" sound, and forming a giant golden circular plate.

The 72 sword lights flew out, merging into the giant circular plate.

A loud "hong" sound echoed, and the golden circular plate disappeared, turning into a thousand-mile-sized golden thunder cloud, with countless golden thunderbolts flashing within.

A mournful cry echoed from the golden thunder cloud, and the nearby void was filled with a chilling scream, as if the void itself was shattering.

A powerful, unmatched devouring force burst forth from the golden thunder cloud, spreading in all directions, causing the void to tremble.

Everything within a hundred thousand miles was drawn towards the golden thunder cloud, including the black-armored ugly man and the red-dressed woman, and the thunder snakes, all of whom were powerless to resist.

The black-armored ugly man and the red-dressed woman's vision blurred, and they found themselves in a golden space.

The golden space was vast and endless, with no visible boundaries, and seemed to be a primordial realm.

Above the golden space, massive golden thunderbolts flashed and moved, forming a series of thunder arrays, and powerful thunder spirits appeared and disappeared.

A terrifying, crushing pressure mixed with the thunder law's fluctuations emanated from the air, pressing down on the two of them.

The black-armored ugly man and the red-dressed woman's silver threads had shattered when they were drawn into the thunder cloud, and they had regained their freedom.

But under the pressure of the thunder law, they felt as if they were being crushed by a mountain, and couldn't move.

The thunder snakes, which had been nearby, were also frozen in place.

However, the thunder beasts' intelligence was low, and under the pressure, they immediately wanted to counterattack, spewing out thick, purple thunderbolts towards the golden thunderbolts in the air.

But the golden thunderbolts simply flashed, and a dozen or so arm-thick golden thunderbolts struck down, faster than the purple thunderbolts, and struck the thunder snakes' heads.

The thunder snakes' heads exploded like eggs, and a golden arc of lightning spread through their bodies, causing them to explode and turn into tiny balls of lightning, which were absorbed into the golden thunder cloud.

The black-armored ugly man and the red-dressed woman watched in shock, their eyes wide with fear, before slowly recovering.

"This is the Heavenly Thunder of the 36 Heavens! Legend has it that this thunder law is the most destructive of the 36 Heavens, capable of destroying everything! Who is the senior who has cultivated this thunder law to such an extent?" The black-armored ugly man looked around, his eyes wide with fear.

The black-armored ugly man had also cultivated the thunder law, and was from a large sect, but the thunder law displayed here was beyond his knowledge.

The red-dressed woman heard his words, and her face showed shock, as she looked around.

At this moment, a low, muffled sound echoed from above.

A magnificent golden heavenly gate appeared in the golden thunder cloud, with golden thunder symbols etched onto it, giving off an ancient, primordial aura.

A suffocating, terrifying pressure emanated from the golden heavenly gate, pressing down on the two of them, ten times stronger than the pressure from the golden thunderbolts.

The black-armored ugly man and the red-dressed woman spat out blood, their faces pale, and their bodies trembling, as if they were being crushed by the pressure.

The two of them were filled with despair, thinking they had encountered a savior, but instead, they had encountered an even greater calamity.

At this moment, a blue-robed man appeared in the air, his hands weaving a spell.

The golden heavenly gate flashed, and disappeared, and the golden space also vanished, leaving the three of them in the Five Lightnings Domain.

The black-armored ugly man and the red-dressed woman felt the pressure lift, and their faces relaxed, as they took deep breaths.
The blue-robed man raised his hand and waved it once more, and the golden lightning clouds in mid-air flashed twice before rapidly dispersing, transforming into 72 golden flying swords and an octagonal jade plate. These objects revolved around the man's body.

The blue-robed man gazed at the flying swords and jade plate, a faint smile on his lips, and then swept his sleeve in a wave.

A burst of emerald-green light shot out from his sleeve, enveloping the flying swords and jade plate, and then withdrawing them. The man's figure flickered, and he appeared before the black-armored man and the red-robed woman.

"You two, are you cultivators from the Great Jin Yuan Immortal Realm?" the blue-robed man asked.

"Yes, I am Zhao San Lei, a disciple of the Shen Xiao Sect, and this is Miao Xian Zi, a loose cultivator of the Golden Immortal realm. Thank you, senior, for saving our lives. May I ask your esteemed name?" The black-armored man, sensing the profound aura emanating from the blue-robed man, showed a respectful expression and asked.

The red-robed woman also bowed to the blue-robed man, her expression extremely respectful.

"My surname is Shi, and you don't need to know my given name. Do you two have a map of the Great Jin Yuan Immortal Realm?" The blue-robed man's eyes flashed as he spoke.

This blue-robed man was actually Han Li.

He had departed from the Eight Desolate Mountains, and after obtaining some clues along the way, he arrived at the Five Radiant Thunder Realm after nearly 20 years. During this time, Han Li had been contemplating the Heavenly Sword Array in the Flower Branch Space, and his understanding of the array had grown deeper. He had become more skilled in setting up the array, unlike when he first comprehended it.

The Heavenly Sword Array was incredibly powerful, but his Blue Bamboo Bee Cloud Sword was somewhat inferior in comparison. It didn't match the array very well.

Therefore, Han Li was overjoyed to arrive at the Five Radiant Thunder Realm and immediately entered the depths of the realm to temper his flying sword using the power of the thunder.

He used several thunder and lightning secret techniques from the "Five Thunder Orthodox True Scripture" and combined them with the power of the Xuan Tian Gourd to re-forge the 72 Blue Bamboo Bee Cloud Swords.

After re-forging, the Blue Bamboo Bee Cloud Swords' internal thunder and lightning laws had greatly increased, reaching the level of a fifth-grade immortal artifact. Their properties had also changed, evolving into the "Du Tian Shen Lei" of the 36 Heavenly Thunders, which was an unexpected surprise.

"I have one," Zhao San Lei hastily replied, taking out a map jade slip and handing it to Han Li.

Han Li accepted the jade slip and scanned it with his divine sense, nodding to himself.

The map on the jade slip was quite detailed, with the locations of the Jiu Yuan Guan and Bai Cuo Shan clearly marked. It was sufficient for his use.

"Senior, are you going to the Great Jin Yuan Immortal Realm? I've lived in the Great Jin Yuan Immortal Realm for many years and am familiar with the area. I can guide you," Zhao San Lei said, a hint of expectation in his eyes.

"That's not necessary, this map jade slip is enough. The Five Radiant Thunder Realm is quite dangerous, and your cultivation is not strong. It's best for you to leave quickly," Han Li said calmly.

Zhao San Lei's face fell upon hearing this, his eyes flashing with disappointment.

He had intended to guide Han Li to the Shen Xiao Sect, not to actually guide him. The Shen Xiao Sect specialized in thunder and lightning laws, and if they could invite Han Li to the sect, it would be a great achievement. Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned, and Han Li refused his offer.

"Senior's words are wise, I was too reckless. We'll take our leave now. If senior needs any help, you can come to the Shen Xiao Sect and find me," Zhao San Lei said, bowing to Han Li.

The red-robed woman also bowed to Han Li, her expression respectful.

But at this moment, the scenery before them rapidly changed, and their eyes became unfocused. They stood there, frozen.

Han Li withdrew his hand, which had been pointing at the two of them. He had used a secret technique to probe their memories, but he didn't sense that they had recognized his identity or had any intention of reporting him to the Heavenly Court.

Although he had altered his appearance, the Blue Bamboo Bee Cloud Sword had been revealed, and those who had seen his wanted poster might still be able to connect the sword to his identity. Now that he was close to the Great Jin Yuan Immortal Realm, he couldn't afford to be careless.

Han Li's fingers flashed with light once more, and he inserted them into the two people's brows. He muttered to himself, and a half-hour passed.

Zhao San Lei and the red-robed woman flew out of the Five Radiant Thunder Realm.

"Zhao, where are we going now? Back to Jin Yan City?" the red-robed woman asked.

"That's right, Sun Chong Shan's treachery was unexpected. Fortunately, the sudden thunderstorm drove away the thunder beasts, or we would have fallen already. This matter can't be let go like this!" Zhao San Lei said coldly.

"We must demand an explanation!" the red-robed woman's face was also filled with anger as she nodded.

The two of them transformed into a purple and red streak of light, flying towards the Great Jin Yuan Immortal Realm.

As they flew away, Han Li finally emerged from the Five Radiant Thunder Realm, gazing in the direction they had gone.

He had just used a secret technique to modify their memories, erasing the part where they met him and replacing it with a scene where they encountered a thunderstorm that drove away the thunder snakes, allowing them to narrowly escape.

Although killing them would have been more convenient, Han Li was not a bloodthirsty person and didn't want to slaughter them indiscriminately. He was willing to expend more effort to avoid doing so.

Moreover, after reaching the Great Luo Realm, he would face the Three Corpse Severing Tribulation, and reckless actions would ultimately affect his mental state.

Han Li's gaze lingered on the two people's receding figures before he turned and flew away.
