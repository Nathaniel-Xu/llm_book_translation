Just as this was happening, a sudden turn of events occurred!

The fire-red cloud cluster that had been grabbed by the dark red hand suddenly expanded, increasing in size by more than ten times in an instant, and shooting out rays of fire-red light that directly pushed open the dark red hand, making it unable to grasp the cloud cluster.

Jiao San's face changed slightly as he opened his mouth to spit out a mouthful of air.

A ball of dark red light shot out from his mouth, containing dozens of threads of the cycle of reincarnation, which merged into the dark red hand.

The dark red hand immediately swelled up, its surface flashing with numerous circular symbols, and the light surrounding it grew several times brighter.

A deep and immeasurable spiritual pressure burst forth from the dark red hand, rampaging uncontrollably throughout the great hall, causing the space around the altar to violently shake like the surface of water.

The hand's five fingers clenched, and the dark red light flashed wildly, immediately pressing down on the red cloud cluster once again.

However, just as Jiao San was about to smile, the suppressed dark red cloud cluster suddenly flashed rapidly, releasing green, blue, yellow, and gold lights.

The five colors of light intertwined, their law energies fusing and resonating.

With a loud "Boom!", a massive roar erupted from the cloud cluster, and the five colors of light burst forth, increasing in size by dozens of times, transforming into a miniature five-colored sun that filled the entire Xuan Tian Dark Light Shield space, and seemed to be rotating and cutting like a windmill.

Each of the five colors of light was like a razor-sharp blade, leaving behind cracks in the void wherever they passed.

With a "Rip!" sound, the seemingly invincible dark red hand was easily torn apart like paper.

"Not good! Nine True, quickly retreat!" Wu Yang, who was outside the light shield, cried out in alarm as he saw the scene unfold.

Jiao San's expression also changed greatly, and his body rapidly retreated backwards, simultaneously waving his hand to produce a small black flag that transformed into a layer of dark misty light in front of him.

His other hand flipped over, producing a silver-colored jade ruler, from which a silver-colored flame erupted.

The two of them merged into a ball-shaped light shield that protected his body.

Jiao San had just finished doing this when the razor-sharp five-colored lights shot towards him, tearing into the two layers of light shields around him.

With a sound like tearing silk, the two layers of light shields only lasted for a single breath before shattering completely.

However, Jiao San had already escaped from the Xuan Tian Dark Light Shield's opening.

But just as Jiao San was about to catch his breath, the five-colored lights shot out from inside the shield, striking the Xuan Tian Dark Light Shield.

The Xuan Tian Dark Light Shield seemed to be easily destroyed from the inside, with countless cracks appearing on its surface before it exploded with a loud "Boom!" sound.

The five-colored lights continued to burst forth, but possibly due to the exhaustion of energy from breaking the Xuan Tian Dark Light Shield, the originally sharp lights had become layered five-colored light waves, which rolled out like a tidal wave, flooding the entire great hall.

Shi Kongmo, Chun Jun True Person, Wu Yang, and the others were swept away by the five-colored light waves, like being hit by countless meteorites, and were all knocked flying without any resistance, crashing into the walls of the great hall.

Jiao San, who was the closest, received the greatest impact, and his entire body was knocked into the wall, spitting out blood wildly.

Only the black-clothed woman, who was standing farther away from the altar, was affected less, although she was also knocked flying, she managed to stabilize her body.

However, the black-clothed woman's hat was blown off, revealing half of her face.

Outside the great hall, Han Li saw this and was shocked, his eyes wide with surprise as he stared at the black-clothed woman.

The dense five-colored light waves did not last for long, and soon dissipated, restoring calm to the great hall.

The entire altar had already been completely destroyed, leaving behind only a pile of rubble, and the five-colored cloud cluster on top of the altar had also disappeared.

Only the sound of "Ding!" was heard, as a small ball of five-colored light fell to the ground near the entrance of the great hall.

 Inside the light was a small, fist-sized five-colored bottle, with a narrow neck and a round body, and some leaf-like patterns on its surface, giving off a mysterious aura.

"This...!" Han Li's body shook again, his face filled with an expression of disbelief.

The five-colored bottle, except for its color, was identical to his own Palm Heaven Bottle.

"Could this be another imitation?" Han Li quickly calmed down, his mind racing with thoughts.

After all, Ma Liang had also possessed an imitation Palm Heaven Bottle, and it was not surprising that the Nine True Sect could create another one.

However, looking at the five-colored bottle's aura, it was far beyond Ma Liang's imitation Palm Heaven Bottle, and was almost on par with the real thing.

The black-clothed woman, who had been knocked flying to the entrance of the great hall, saw this and was overjoyed, rushing towards the small bottle like a bolt of lightning.

At the same time, she swept her sleeve, and a dark red light shot out, curling towards the five-colored bottle, about to grab it.

But just as she was about to succeed, a purple electric light and a red flame shot out from outside the hall, almost simultaneously striking the black-clothed woman's dark red light.

The black-clothed woman did not expect this, and her dark red light was easily torn apart.

The electric light and flame were followed by two figures, one purple and one red, who were none other than Huo Yuan and Chi Meng.
Huò Yuān pinched his fingers together and the purple lightning bolt split into two, transforming into two purple lightning serpents. The two serpents were several meters long and as thick as a person's leg, with dazzling purple electric arcs dancing across their bodies. They emitted a "hiss" sound, as if they were living creatures, and their aura was truly astonishing.

One of the serpents suddenly coiled and struck at the black-clothed woman.

The other serpent, however, struck at the red flame, wrapping itself around it in an instant and constricting it tightly.

At the same time, the serpent opened its mouth and spat out a purple lightning bolt that shot towards the five-colored small bottle on the ground.

"Foolish!" Chi Mèng's face turned red with anger, and she spat out a mouthful of words.

A red flame burst forth from her mouth, instantly growing larger and forming a red net that enveloped the purple serpent.

The purple serpent's lightning bolt was also trapped within the red net, and the two energies clashed fiercely, producing a loud, crackling sound. The purple lightning bolt dissipated and disappeared.

At the same time, Chi Mèng raised her hand and waved it.

A red light shot out, spinning rapidly before transforming into a red fire shield. The shield was adorned with nine red fire dragons, and it was the Nine Dragons Divine Fire Shield. It descended towards Huò Yuān, covering him.

Huò Yuān's face sank, and he slapped his forehead. A complex purple lightning pattern appeared on his forehead, flashing with intense purple lightning.

The purple light flashed, and two purple lightning orbs shot out from the pattern, growing rapidly to the size of wheels. They collided with each other, producing a deafening thunderclap.

A massive, tens of meters wide, purple lightning cloud suddenly appeared in the air, with countless purple lightning bolts flashing wildly within it. The thunderclap and the sound of rushing wind intertwined, creating a terrifying spectacle, as if the God of Thunder had descended.

The purple lightning cloud's radiance flashed, and it struck the Nine Dragons Divine Fire Shield that was hovering in mid-air.

The lightning and flames clashed fiercely, producing a deafening roar.

This purple lightning cloud seemed ordinary, but it actually contained unfathomable power. It was able to hold the Nine Dragons Divine Fire Shield in mid-air.

Although the two were traveling together, they were now fighting over the treasure. The black-clothed woman dodged the purple serpent's attack with a flick of her body and pressed her hand down, summoning the dark red ancient mirror once again.

A dark red crystal light shot out from the mirror, striking the purple serpent's head.

With a loud "crack," the purple serpent's head shattered, and its body exploded.

The black-clothed woman's eyes flashed beneath her black veil, and she took advantage of the distraction to make a move. Her body was surrounded by a wave of black light, and she suddenly disappeared without a sound, moving swiftly towards the five-colored small bottle on the ground.

"Don't think you can deceive us with your stealth!" Chi Mèng suddenly turned her head, her hands weaving a spell.

Two of the fire dragons on the Nine Dragons Divine Fire Shield opened their mouths, spewing out two dragon-shaped flames that shot towards the black-clothed woman. The air around her was incinerated, leaving nothing but a void.

Huò Yuān also raised his hand, pointing at the black-clothed woman's location. Tens of purple lightning flames shot down, striking the spot where she was.

The terrifying lightning laws emanating from the purple flames seemed to be able to tear the heavens apart.

The black-clothed woman's eyes narrowed, and she accelerated towards the five-colored small bottle on the ground.

At the same time, she spat out a mouthful of essence blood, which transformed into a blood-red light that merged with the dark red ancient mirror.

The mirror instantly grew larger, and circular patterns began to spin rapidly on its surface.

A dark red crystal light, ten times brighter than before, shot out from the mirror, enveloping the two dragon-shaped flames and the tens of purple lightning flames.

The crystal light pulsed with a mesmerizing, maze-like pattern, and the dragon-shaped flames and purple lightning flames were momentarily frozen in place before beginning to dissipate.

Perhaps the dragon-shaped flames and purple lightning flames contained too much power, as they dissipated very slowly.

The black-clothed woman's body also froze momentarily, but she took a deep breath and continued to charge forward like a bolt of lightning.

Chi Mèng's face changed, and she shouted angrily, her hands weaving a spell.

The Nine Dragons Divine Fire Shield broke free from the purple lightning cloud's restraint, transforming into a red light that shot towards the black-clothed woman.

The nine fire dragons on the shield detached themselves and flew towards the black-clothed woman, spewing out red flames that struck the dark red crystal light.

The temperature in the grand hall surged, as if they had been transported to a sea of molten lava.

Huò Yuān also stopped fighting Chi Mèng and let out a low growl, his hands weaving a spell.

The purple lightning cloud churned and boiled, shooting down towards the ground. The thunderclap was deafening, and hundreds of thick lightning flames rained down, striking the dark red crystal light.

The crystal light pulsed wildly before shattering, transforming into countless sparks that scattered everywhere.

At the same time, the dark red ancient mirror also shattered, splitting into two halves with a loud "crack."
