Ten days later, Han Li reappeared in the Spiritual Realm.

"Friend Han, you've come again today, are you looking for another fight?" The blue-robed Han Li, with his eyes shining brightly, stood up and smiled.

"Indeed, but before that, I have something to ask you." Han Li said slowly.

"What is it that you want to ask? Go ahead and speak." The blue-robed Han Li replied, his hands clasped behind his back.

"You said last time that to sever the self, one must kill friends, wives, and parents. What did you mean by that?" Han Li's eyes narrowed, staring intently at his opponent.

"Ah, that's something you'll have to figure out for yourself." The blue-robed Han Li chuckled, shaking his head, clearly knowing the answer but not willing to share it.

Han Li fell silent for a moment, then suddenly charged forward, unleashing a powerful punch.

A massive golden fist shadow appeared, carrying a destructive force that threatened to annihilate everything.

The blue-robed Han Li's face remained unchanged, his body radiating a brilliant golden light. With a swift movement, a massive palm shadow appeared, resembling a wave crashing against the shore.

The golden fist shadow struck the layered palm shadows, breaking through hundreds of them, but its power was greatly diminished, and it was ultimately shattered by the blue-robed Han Li's single palm strike.

Just then, a flash of lightning appeared behind him, and Han Li's figure suddenly materialized, his fists striking like the wind.

Two massive Five Elements Annihilation Fists descended, their speed faster than before, instantly reaching the blue-robed Han Li's head.

However, the blue-robed Han Li's body rapidly spun, releasing a multitude of golden lights that formed a whirlwind-like barrier around him.

The two massive fists struck the barrier, but they were repelled, flying back out.

The golden barrier trembled violently, then disappeared.

"Haha, I understand now. You're trying to refine your control over the laws through our battles, aren't you? Your cultivation has progressed too quickly, and your control over the immense power within you is insufficient. If you want to contend with the ancients or the moderns, you must make up for this deficiency. Fighting me is indeed a good way to do so." The blue-robed Han Li's figure floated backward, laughing.

Han Li's eyes flashed, but he didn't respond.

The blue-robed Han Li's words were indeed one of Han Li's goals.

However, he had another purpose: to gather information about the self through his interactions with the blue-robed Han Li.

As long as they maintained close proximity, Han Li could discern something from his opponent, regardless of how tight-lipped he was.

Han Li's thoughts turned, and he charged forward once more, his fists and palms moving in tandem, unleashing a flurry of attacks.

The blue-robed Han Li's hands danced, his body radiating golden lights that transformed into various shapes, deflecting Han Li's attacks.

"Just be careful, for if I seize the opportunity, I'll annihilate you here, and this body will be mine. As for the name 'Han Li,' it won't change, for I am you, and you are me." The blue-robed Han Li smiled, his eyes gleaming with a profound, unsettling depth.

"You can try." Han Li said, charging forward once more.

The two continued to fight, their battle raging on for days, until they were both exhausted, and only then did they stop.

Days passed, and Han Li, having recovered, entered the Spiritual Realm once more, engaging in a fierce battle with the blue-robed Han Li.

This cycle of fighting and stopping continued, with time passing in the blink of an eye, until ten thousand years had elapsed.

In the Spiritual Realm, two blurry golden figures clashed, their movements lightning-fast, leaving behind a trail of afterimages.

Punches, palm strikes, sword energies, and dark lights filled the air, colliding and intersecting in a blur of speed and power.

Suddenly, a deafening explosion shook the Spiritual Realm, and the two figures retreated, revealing Han Li and the blue-robed Han Li.

Han Li's body radiated a frantic golden light, and he unleashed a single, powerful punch.

A multitude of golden fist shadows erupted from his body, not just from his fists, but from his entire being.

Each fist shadow was a massive Five Elements Annihilation Fist, varying in size and length, intertwining to form a colossal net that enveloped the Spiritual Realm.

The overwhelming power and law energy permeated the space, making it impossible to avoid.

The blue-robed Han Li stood still, not dodging, his sleeves fluttering as he extended a finger, shouting: "Annihilation!"

A massive, earth-shaking roar filled the Spiritual Realm, and the surroundings turned a dark, grayish hue.

An absolute, boundless power emerged, colliding with the countless fist shadows.

A thunderous explosion shook the Spiritual Realm, and the fist shadows shattered, restoring the space to its original color.

Han Li and the blue-robed Han Li stumbled backward, their bodies trembling, still evenly matched.

Han Li's expression turned somber, as if he had lost interest, and he didn't continue the fight.
"What, aren't you going to continue fighting?" The blue-robed Han Li also didn't take the initiative to attack.

"I won't have much hope of winning if we keep fighting, I'll take my leave for today." Han Li waved his hand, and his body flashed, disappearing from sight.

After over 10,000 years of fighting, the relationship between the two had undergone a subtle change.

In reality, the two were almost identical in terms of their cultivation and strength, and even their personalities were similar. Now, after so many years of fighting, they had developed a sense of being both enemies and friends.

The blue-robed Han Li watched as Han Li left, then turned around and flew towards the depths of his spiritual realm.

Han Li's consciousness returned to his body, and he felt a slight fatigue, so he closed his eyes and took a moment to regulate his breathing.

After recovering, he didn't enter his spiritual realm again. These years of fighting with his "self" had allowed him to grasp the limits of his control over time, and continuing to fight wouldn't bring any further progress.

Furthermore, during this time, he had also gained a deeper understanding of his own "self" from his "self".

As he pondered, Han Li flipped his hand, and a book appeared in his hand.

The book was completely black, seemingly made from some kind of beast skin, and was very old, giving off a feeling of having been washed by countless years of time.

This was something he had obtained by chance through the Wheel of Reincarnation, a rare book said to be written by a descendant of a Dao Ancestor, recording some of the Dao Ancestor's strange and unusual experiences.

The part that interested him the most was the section about the Dao Ancestor's final severing of his own "self".

Although it was only a few pages long, with only a few hundred words, it had made him think deeply, and he had gained some insights from it that he had never considered before.

For example, the Dao Ancestor had spent nearly a thousand years searching for the true meaning of "self" before severing his own "self", even going so far as to return to his original sect's ruins, where he had sat in meditation for a hundred days.

In Han Li's view, this was perhaps the Dao Ancestor's way of trying to find his original aspiration for cultivating the Dao, in order to help him discover and sever his own "self". It was somewhat similar to hiding in the mortal world, and had a certain unique charm to it.

Jin Tong had also had some exchanges with him over the past 10,000 years, but Jin Tong hadn't severed his own "self" in this life, so his help was limited.

Han Li quickly flipped through the black book, "slamming" it shut, and stood up, seemingly having made some kind of decision. He left the attic, and went outside.

Nangong Wan had also built an attic outside, where she was sitting in meditation.

After 10,000 years of bitter cultivation, combined with the rich resources Han Li had given her, and the abundant heavenly energy in the Flower Petal Space, Nangong Wan's cultivation had reached the peak of the True Immortal realm, and she was only one step away from becoming a Gold Immortal.

Han Li nodded slightly, and sent a transmission.

Nangong Wan immediately stopped her cultivation, and came outside.

"Husband, have you finished your cultivation? Have you made any progress?"

"Not yet, the gains have been limited, I'm thinking of going out for a walk. Will you come with me?" Han Li said, taking Nangong Wan's hand.

"Okay, I've never traveled the world since I ascended to the True Immortal realm." Nangong Wan smiled.

"I'll be leaving the Flower Petal Space, and the accelerated space will disappear. Will you come with me, Gold Immortal?" Han Li asked, turning to Jin Tong's closed-off area.

"I won't be a bother, you two go on your trip." Jin Tong's voice came from afar.

Han Li didn't force the issue, and dispersed the spiritual realm, bringing Nangong Wan to the outside of the Tianwai Space.

Nangong Wan had never seen such a scene before, and her face was filled with surprise.

Han Li waved his hand, and a beam of golden light appeared, lifting Nangong Wan's body. As he flew forward, he explained the situation to her.

After flying for half a month, he descended downwards, and soon arrived on the ground.

This was a black sea, with waves crashing against the shore, and very little spiritual energy.

In the distance, a small island could be seen, with many residents, and a bustling atmosphere. However, the entire island was surrounded by a powerful seal, which seemed to be sealing off the island.

"This scenery is quite unique, but I wonder what place this is?" Nangong Wan asked curiously.

"This is the Black Wind Sea, and that island is called the Wumeng Island. I came here the second time I ascended to the True Immortal realm." Han Li looked at the sea and the island, a nostalgic expression on his face.

Han Li had previously told Nangong Wan about the Black Wind Island, and she carefully examined the scene before her, trying to match it with what she had heard before.

Han Li moved, and landed on the sea surface near the island, walking on the waves. He looked around, seemingly searching for something.

Nangong Wan saw Han Li's actions, and didn't disturb him.

Han Li walked around the island for a while, before returning to the air.

"Let's go."

Han Li didn't say anything else, and brought Nangong Wan to a certain direction.

He flew slowly, seemingly thinking about something as he flew. Occasionally, he would tell Nangong Wan about his experiences in the places they passed through.

After a few days, they arrived at a large island, which was the Black Wind Island.

Nangong Wan didn't wait for Han Li to explain, and had already recognized the place from the signs on the Black Wind City.

"Is this the Black Wind City, the city that connects to the outside world, where you stayed in the past?" Nangong Wan asked, her eyes sparkling with laughter.
