Time was of the essence, and it was crucial to break through this defensive barrier. The outcome of this battle would be decided in this one move.

Suddenly, a loud shout echoed from the sky.

As the sound fell, the sky shook, and the figure of Tian Xing Zun, the Heavenly Star Sovereign, appeared out of thin air. His face, normally lazy and carefree, was now stern and serious.

In his hand, he grasped a silver spear adorned with hundreds of crimson crystals, pointing it at the sky. The crystals glowed brightly, illuminating the clouds.

The clouds immediately began to churn and boil, turning a deep crimson color.

The sound of thunder rumbled in the distance, like the approaching storm of summer rain. The clouds shook violently, and massive fireballs, each the size of a millstone, fell from the sky, piercing the clouds like meteors, and crashing into the golden barrier, creating a shower of sparks and flames.

However, the golden barrier, though shaken, continued to ripple and undulate, absorbing the impact of the fireballs, and remained unbroken.

"You shameless traitor!" a senior elder of the Jiu Yuan Sect shouted.

The other elders and disciples were also filled with righteous indignation, gazing up at Tian Xing Zun with anger in their eyes.

Tian Xing Zun, however, ignored them, and with a wave of his spear, launched another attack at the barrier.

...

In contrast to the chaos outside, the interior of the Jiu Yuan Palace was eerily calm, with only the occasional tremor of the buildings and the sound of explosions in the distance.

At this moment, in a beautifully landscaped garden within the palace, a silver symbol array appeared on the ground, emitting a brilliant light. Five figures emerged from the array, including three individuals wearing black masks from the Wheel of Rebirth Temple.

One of the masked figures, a tall and imposing man with a monkey mask, spoke up, "Haha, it seems that the heart of the Jiu Yuan Palace is indeed the most tranquil place."

A woman with a dragon mask added, "We must be cautious and avoid confrontation. We don't know who might be lurking in the shadows."

The woman glanced at her companion, who was wearing a rabbit mask. He was a slender figure with disheveled hair, and his face was obscured by the mask. He seemed to be muttering to himself.

Wu Yang turned to the person behind him and said, "We can't rely on spiritual sensing here, so we'll have to rely on you to guide us, Lu."

The person, Lu Chuan Feng, who had previously killed the Phoenix Heaven Envoy, replied, "I've only been to the Jiu Yuan Palace a few times, so I can only provide a rough direction. We'll have to rely on our companion to find the exact location."

A gentle voice spoke up from beside Lu Chuan Feng, "Don't worry, as long as the object appears within my range, I can find its exact location."

The woman with the dragon mask raised an eyebrow, looking at the speaker, who was wearing a black dress and a black veil that covered her face. Only her neck was visible, and it was as white as jade.

The woman's identity was unknown, but Wu Yang remembered seeing her in the strange space where they had met the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth Temple.

Wu Yang said, "Let's move quickly, we can't afford to waste any more time."

Lu Chuan Feng nodded, and led the group forward, with the others following closely behind.

After they left, a strange glow appeared from behind a cluster of spirit flowers, and two figures emerged from the shadows.

One of them was a tall and slender young man with long black hair, a white lock of hair falling across his forehead. He was none other than the Master of the Bai Zao Mountain, Huo Yuan.

The other person was a beautiful woman wearing a red dress, her skin as white as porcelain, and her eyes sparkling with a hint of mischief. She was none other than Chi Meng.
“Those remnants of the Wheel of Rebirth really want to do something? Have they gone crazy, actually planning to attack the Nine Yuan Observatory?” Chi Meng cautiously looked around in the direction that Jiao San and the others had left, saying.

“If the Nine Yuan Observatory was really so vulnerable, how could it have been suppressing us, the Hundred Creations Mountain, for so many years? Their purpose for coming here is probably the same as ours.” Huo Yuan sneered.

“Also for that thing?” Chi Meng's expression changed, and she asked in surprise.

“They dare to take such a great risk to come here, and I think there's no other reason besides that thing. What a clever move, openly repairing the road while secretly crossing the river.” Huo Yuan nodded slightly, and pondered.

“Huo Mountain Master, that thing was said to be crafted by the Hundred Creations Mountain, don't you really know what its purpose is?” Chi Meng hesitated for a moment, but still couldn't help asking.

“That thing was crafted by the previous generation's Mountain Master of the Hundred Creations Mountain, and it's said that it was personally commissioned by the Nine Yuan Observatory's Old Ancestor, who rarely shows his face, at a great cost. However, the thing that was crafted after tens of thousands of years, was just a dead object similar to a container, and its true purpose couldn't be known.” Huo Yuan sighed.

“Being able to make that Old Ancestor personally take action, and have the previous generation's Mountain Master personally craft it, shows that this thing is truly extraordinary. But since it's a dead object that was crafted tens of thousands of years ago... why did you, Huo Mountain Master, suddenly suggest to the Heavenly Court that it should be investigated?” Chi Meng asked, becoming even more perplexed.

The reason for this transmission ceremony being so complicated, and even having a competition for the command token, was to have a reason to stay in the Nine Yuan Observatory for a while, and try to investigate something.

“At the time when the previous generation's Mountain Master was crafting this thing, he had doubts and wanted to understand its true purpose, but unfortunately, he not only didn't get an answer, but also triggered his heart demon...” Huo Yuan said, suddenly stopping, and a hint of resentment flashed in his eyes, before he continued.

The previous generation's Mountain Master of the Hundred Creations Mountain was his master, and he had been affected by the heart demon, failing in his last attempt to sever his mortal ties, and the Hundred Creations Mountain would have had a Dao Ancestor by now, and its position in the Immortal Realm would be vastly different.

“Back then, the Mountain Master said that the Nine Yuan Observatory has great ambitions for this thing, and I must keep an eye on it, and if the Nine Yuan Observatory further refines this thing, making it a immortal artifact, I must find a way to investigate it clearly.” Huo Yuan paused, and continued.

“Further refinement? What does that mean?” Chi Meng asked, not understanding.

“That thing's refinement in the Hundred Creations Mountain only completed half of it, and it's just a container filled with endless possibilities. The Nine Yuan Observatory has been secretly refining it, and based on calculations, it should have been completed a few days ago.” Huo Yuan said.

“Does that mean the Nine Yuan Observatory has been refining this thing for tens of thousands of years?” Chi Meng asked, shocked.

“When this thing was about to be completed, it actually triggered some heavenly phenomena, although it was quickly covered up by the Nine Yuan Observatory, but the Heavenly Court has also sensed it, so when I brought up this matter, I immediately got a response. Originally, it should have been Feng Tian Xian Shi and I investigating this matter together, but it was disrupted by the Wheel of Rebirth. However, this water has been stirred up, and it's not entirely a bad thing.” Huo Yuan continued.

“Huo Mountain Master, shouldn't we catch up to them?” Chi Meng asked, nodding, and looking in the direction that Jiao San and the others had left.

“Not yet. Although we can't use spiritual sense to investigate here, that black-clothed woman with the bamboo hat, has a very strange aura fluctuation, and if we get too close, we might be discovered.” Huo Yuan shook his head.

After waiting for a dozen breaths, Huo Yuan finally spoke, saying "Let's go", and led Chi Meng to chase after them.

...

In another part of the Nine Yuan Palace, in a garden, a fake mountain made of piled-up rocks suddenly made a muffled sound.

A rock was lifted, along with the earth, and several figures jumped out from underground, landing behind the fake mountain.

The person in the lead was a tall, ordinary-looking man, with a pair of eyes that seemed like deep, dark wells, and it was none other than Han Li.

 Beside him were a white-clothed youth, and two women, Xiao Bai, Lan Yan, and Jin Tong.

 Qi Hu had returned to the Huaxi space to rest, as she had suffered a great loss of energy due to the evil corpse.

“Ah, where is this place? The aura around us... why does it feel like we're still within the Nine Yuan Palace?” Xiao Bai wrinkled her nose, sniffing, and said with a worried expression.

“The underground tunnels were destroyed, and we can't return by the original route, so we can only come up and look for a way out. Lan Daoist, do you know how to leave from here?” Han Li asked.

“Nine Yuan Palace is a key location of the Nine Yuan Observatory, and I don't have the qualifications to enter, so I'm not familiar with the situation here, just like you.” Lan Yan sighed.

At this point, she was in a precarious situation, and according to the sect's laws, she should be punished severely.

Han Li heard this, and his brow furrowed, as he looked around, trying to find a direction to leave.

“Why are you all making such sour faces? With me, a Daoist fairy, here, are you worried about finding a way out?” Jin Tong suddenly spoke up, with a confident expression.
