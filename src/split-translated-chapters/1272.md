Liu Daren, the ritual altar was built according to your requirements, and the remaining spiritual materials are all here. 

As he spoke, Luo Feng handed over a black storage ring. 

Han Li had already inspected the altar when he flew over, and it was built very neatly, without any problems. He waved his hand at Luo Feng and said, "You can keep it."

"Thank you, Liu Daren." Luo Feng was overjoyed and quickly bowed to thank him.

"I've already taught you the method of operating the formation, and I'll let Jintong guard the formation for you, so you can cultivate in peace. However, the time I can give you is limited, only 49 days." Han Li said.

"If this formation is as powerful as you say, 49 days is enough." The Di Qi incarnation said.

Luo Feng stood to the side, watching the two speak, and a hint of doubt flashed in his eyes.

Han Li saw it but didn't say anything, and instead flew down to the altar.

He walked around the altar, turned his wrist, and took out a series of round stones imbued with the dense water attribute law, and embedded them into the formation's grooves.

"Alright, you can enter the formation now." After finishing, he returned to the ground and said.

The Di Qi incarnation nodded, and then jumped up, landing in the center of the altar, and sat down in a cross-legged position.

Not long after, a chanting sound arose, and the entire altar shook violently, with a series of pillars of light shooting up into the sky, stirring up the clouds, and forming a massive whirlpool.

The surrounding sea area was filled with turbulent clouds, and a surge of water attribute spiritual energy gathered from all directions, pouring into the whirlpool, and then falling onto the altar.

The Di Qi incarnation bathed in it, and his body suddenly shone with a blue light, turning into a transparent crystal-like state, absorbing the spiritual energy.

"You stay here and guard the formation for 49 days." Han Li patted Jintong's shoulder and said.

"Got it, Uncle." Jintong nodded, her mind elsewhere.

Han Li knew that aside from eating those heavenly materials and treasures, it was unrealistic to expect her to focus on one thing.

Fortunately, this place was remote and far from the Heavenly Court's influence, and it was relatively safe. If someone wanted to cause trouble, as long as Jintong released a hint of her aura, it would be enough to make them retreat.

"Luo Feng, you come with me to Wumeng Island." Han Li looked at Luo Feng and said.

The latter nodded, and followed Han Li as they flew away.

"I know you're puzzled about what you just saw, right?" Han Li said, hovering in mid-air, waiting for Luo Feng to catch up.

Luo Feng didn't know how to respond, so he just nodded.

"Actually, I didn't plan to keep it a secret, but... " Han Li then told Luo Feng about the Di Qi incarnation's situation, but naturally left out the part about beheading the corpse.

The two of them slowly flew back to Wumeng Island, Luo Feng initially looking terrified, but after hearing that Han Li had already made arrangements, his expression gradually returned to normal.

"Liu Daren, our Wumeng Island has been able to survive until now, and thrive, thanks to your support and protection. You didn't have to tell me, but since you've arranged everything so meticulously, I won't have any other thoughts, and will follow your arrangements." Luo Feng bowed deeply and said.

"Very good." Han Li nodded in satisfaction.

In the following days, Han Li stayed on Wumeng Island, secretly directing Luo Feng to arrange the aftermath.

A island that was originally sustained by faith and bloodline couldn't be easily changed.

So, Han Li started from the basics, selecting a group of talented children from the island, and gathering them in the ancestral temple, teaching them the fundamental methods of cultivation.

As long as the seeds of change were sown, and Luo Feng guided and supported them, Wumeng Island would gradually evolve into a place similar to a sect, and it was only a matter of time.

49 days later, Han Li left Wumeng Island and returned to Tiansheng Island.

As soon as he arrived on the island, Jintong immediately came to greet him.

"Uncle, you're finally back! Your incarnation left seclusion four days ago, and has been sitting in silence, like a mute, not saying a word, I was worried you'd turn into a stone." She complained.

"Has there been any commotion here?" Han Li asked.

"There was, on the second day after you left, and then several more groups came, all sneaking around, not daring to get too close. I followed your instructions and chased them away." Jintong replied.

"How did you chase them away?" Han Li asked, slightly suspicious.

"I told them that the Wumeng Island ancestral god was in seclusion here, and that outsiders weren't allowed to approach." Jintong avoided Han Li's eyes and said.

"You didn't fight anyone?" Han Li raised an eyebrow and asked.

"I didn't... I hit one of them, he was a bit too bold, and came back to snoop around. I gave him a good smack, and he didn't come back up for half a day." Jintong smiled sheepishly and said.

"You didn't hurt anyone seriously?" Han Li asked.

"No, no... I didn't use much force. But after that, no one came back." Jintong quickly shook her head and said.
Han Li nodded and didn't say anything else, jumping onto the altar in the center of the island.

The various water-attribute xian yuan stones embedded around the altar had all turned grayish-white, and the xian ling energy they contained had naturally gathered into the body of the Di Qi transformed.

At this moment, the Di Qi transformed body was sitting cross-legged on the ground, its entire body still maintaining a crystalline blue color, with its internal organs and viscera all intact. One could see the xian ling energy transformed from the threads of faith flowing within it, but it still couldn't give off the vibrant aura of a living being.

Within the head of the transformed body, a water-blue virtual light silhouette could be seen, looking like a cultivator's yuan ying, but it was far less vivid and clear than a yuan ying, appearing more like a wisp of smoke.

"The divine soul has converged, the body is refined, and it has reached the expected state," Han Li said with a nod.

At this moment, the virtual light silhouette suddenly dispersed, spreading out like smoke, covering the entire body.

The transparent sensation on its body disappeared, and its shape returned to normal.

"I've prepared everything, what's next?" the Di Qi transformed body asked, its eyes suddenly opening.

Han Li smiled slightly, not saying anything, and simply waved his hand. A silver light portal suddenly appeared beside him.

The next moment, a girl in a black dress walked out of the portal, and it was Ti Hun.

After a long time of recuperation, her injuries had fully recovered, and her cultivation had returned to its peak.

"This is Ti Hun, next, she will use her divine soul secret technique to seal your divine soul and soul essence, you may need to sleep for a while," Han Li said.

The Di Qi transformed body looked at Ti Hun from head to toe, opening its mouth, but not speaking, only nodding.

Then, it closed its eyes, waiting for Ti Hun to cast her spell.

Han Li saw this and nodded to Ti Hun.

Ti Hun walked forward, arriving beside the Di Qi transformed body.

She raised her hand, pointing at the Di Qi transformed body's brow with her middle and index fingers, and a dark red light appeared on her fingertips, radiating wave-like ripples.

A powerful divine soul fluctuation spread out from it.

Han Li watched for a moment, then turned and walked down from the altar.

He rotated his wrist, and a light flashed in his palm, and several array flags and array disks appeared, which he placed in the various rock crevices on the island.

About two hours later, Han Li had walked around the entire island, placing the over 1,800 array flags and array disks he had prepared in advance.

When he returned to the altar, Ti Hun had already finished, and the Di Qi transformed body had returned to its original crystalline blue color, but the smoke-like virtual light silhouette in its head had disappeared.

Han Li released his divine sense, carefully examining the Di Qi transformed body, and his eyebrows slightly rose in surprise.

"With my divine sense and the connection between my divine soul and the transformed body, I shouldn't be able to sense its divine soul, could it be that you've extracted it from its body?" Han Li asked in doubt.

"Master, didn't you say that the divine soul of the ancestors can't be separated from the body of the earth xian for a long time? How could I do that?" Ti Hun smiled and said.

"It seems that your soul-sealing technique is truly powerful, and even I couldn't see through it," Han Li praised.

Ti Hun heard this and covered her mouth with a smile, pointing at the Di Qi transformed body's palm.

A light flashed on its palm, and a blurry human silhouette the size of a dragon's eye appeared, disappearing again after a flash.

"In this way, even if the evil corpse occupies the earth xian's body, it won't be able to sense the transformed body's divine soul," Han Li said.

He then turned his wrist, and a qing bamboo sword appeared in his palm, starting to draw a symbol array on the ground.

This symbol array was extremely complex, far surpassing any Han Li had seen before, with three layers of array patterns.

The innermost layer was a yin-yang fish-like pattern, the middle layer was a circle of returning symbols, and the outermost layer was a circle of ring-shaped symbols.

Each layer of symbols was filled with countless thumb-sized symbol characters.

After finishing the symbol array, Han Li took out over a dozen xian yuan stones and seven or eight treasures containing different ling energy auras, placing them on each array eye and array axle.

By the time everything was set up, the sun had already set on the distant sea, dyeing the entire ocean orange.

"Alright... Jin Tong has gone to play in the stormy sea, go call her back, and have her guard the southern end of the island with you, while I set up the array," Han Li said to Ti Hun, putting away the qing bamboo sword.

Ti Hun nodded, turned, and was about to leave.

"After the altar array is activated, you'll open the island's boundary, and no matter what happens on the altar, you must not intervene, only guard the island's boundary, not allowing anyone to enter or exit, remember?" Han Li's face turned serious, reminding her.

"Remembered," Ti Hun nodded and said.

She then jumped into the air, disappearing into the sky above the island under Han Li's watchful eyes.
