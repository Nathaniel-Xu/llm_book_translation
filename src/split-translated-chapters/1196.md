Han Li saw this situation and no longer felt the need to leave in a hurry, instead waiting for the Two Life Tree and the Eastern Yi Divine Wood Forest to fully merge.

However, at this moment, an unexpected scene appeared once again.

Only to see the Guangyin Tiandi Great Array, which was set up in the flower branch space, suddenly tremble with a massive light, its radiance filling the entire space, and even suppressing the light of Han Li's spiritual domain.

Han Li saw this and his heart tightened.

Could it be that the Xian Yuan Stone had been depleted, and the Guangyin Tiandi Great Array could no longer be maintained?

Just as he was wondering, a dazzling golden light suddenly rose from the center of the array, drawing an arc in the air, and rushed towards him.

The golden light enveloped a golden circular plate with various symbols flashing on its surface.

Han Li took a closer look and discovered that the plate was none other than the Jun Tian Ri Gui, which he had used to set up the Guangyin Tiandi Great Array.

He worried that it would affect the spiritual domain's creation, so he made a grasping motion with his hands, turning them into two cyan light palms, wanting to grab the Jun Tian Ri Gui.

However, he saw that the Ri Gui drew an arc in the air, suddenly changing direction, and rushed straight up towards the Zhen Yan Treasure Wheel suspended in the air.

A loud thunderclap echoed in the air, and the Jun Tian Ri Gui exploded as it approached the Zhen Yan Treasure Wheel.

However, what was strange was that the Jun Tian Ri Gui exploded, but its contained golden attribute time law power did not disperse, instead condensing into a golden light that merged with the Zhen Yan Treasure Wheel.

The golden light wrapped around the Zhen Yan Treasure Wheel like a silk thread, causing the originally illusory treasure wheel to start taking shape, and the golden light it emitted became even more solid.

Han Li had prepared for this scene, having experienced the merging of the Two Life Tree, and his heart was filled with joy.

He himself didn't expect that this closed-door meditation would bring so many gains.

However, he couldn't understand why the Zhen Yan Treasure Wheel, which hadn't entered the realm of creation, would also merge with the Jun Tian Ri Gui, just like the Two Life Tree had merged with the Eastern Yi Divine Wood Forest.

Could it be that the spiritual domain's boundaries could be directly transcended?

Han Li was puzzled, and suddenly felt that his spiritual domain was a bit off, the faint golden light screen surrounding him was trembling in a regular, small amplitude.

Immediately after, a loud, muffled sound echoed.

The Zhen Yan Treasure Wheel above his head suddenly shook violently, and a powerful attractive force emerged from it.

"Damn it..."

Han Li's heart sank, and he quickly waved his hand to cast a spell, wanting to interrupt the merging of the Jun Tian Ri Gui and the Zhen Yan Treasure Wheel.

However, this merging had already reached a critical stage, and intervening at this moment would certainly cause great damage, and the Jun Tian Ri Gui might even collapse and disappear, while the Zhen Yan Treasure Wheel would also suffer heavy damage.

But Han Li couldn't care about these things at this moment.

This merging of the two would require a large amount of time law power, and the Zhen Yan Treasure Wheel, which hadn't entered the realm of creation, couldn't provide such power.

And Han Li's own time law power had been depleted during the merging of the Two Life Tree and the Eastern Yi Divine Wood Forest, so he couldn't support the Zhen Yan Treasure Wheel at this moment.

Han Li worried that the Zhen Yan Treasure Wheel and the Jun Tian Ri Gui's merging would forcefully absorb his spiritual domain's power to nourish themselves.

As expected, with the attractive force from the Zhen Yan Treasure Wheel growing stronger, the spiritual domain's light screen began to shake violently, and a thread of golden light started to separate from it, swimming towards the top like a tadpole.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and his hands shone with a brilliant light as he condensed two massive, ethereal hands in the air, clasping towards the Zhen Yan Treasure Wheel.

The air was distorted by his hands, and a ripple effect spread out, pressing towards the Zhen Yan Treasure Wheel, trying to sever its connection with the spiritual domain.

However, this was all in vain, as when Han Li's hands approached the Zhen Yan Treasure Wheel, the golden light it emitted wrapped around his hands like a thousand golden threads, blocking his advance.

This light contained extremely pure time law power, and Han Li, with his current abilities, was unable to overcome it, and could only watch as his spiritual domain slowly dissolved.

Han Li wouldn't sit idly by, and with a thought, the Eastern Yi Divine Wood Forest suddenly shook violently, its leaves rustling, and a dense, worldly law power surged towards the sky.

The ground was filled with the sound of wind, and a layer of golden sand flew up, swirling towards the sky like a storm, and the winding river also churned with muddy waves, surging upwards.

In response, a rain of fire and stars descended from the sky, crashing down towards the ground.

The entire spiritual domain was in chaos, and the other four time law powers simultaneously launched a counterattack, colliding with the Zhen Yan Treasure Wheel in a massive explosion.

"Boom..."

A deafening sound echoed, and a blinding golden light exploded, transforming into a golden wave that swept across the spiritual domain.
The golden light spread, and the Sky Pavilion Array burst forth with a wave of temporal fluctuations. The two energies didn't clash, but instead merged together, giving birth to a strange power that enveloped the entire spiritual realm. Han Li's heart was shocked by this phenomenon.

The golden light screen suddenly contracted, shrinking down to a radius of several dozen feet around Han Li.

A metallic clanging sound echoed, and the space outside the spiritual realm seemed to solidify. The bamboo forest stopped swaying, the mist ceased to rise, and even the wind appeared to come to a standstill.

At the same time, the True Speech Treasure Wheel and the Jun Tian Ri Huo above Han Li's head, the strange attractive force disappeared, and the two seemed to enter a relatively calm state.

Han Li's mind was filled with doubts, and he didn't know what was happening.

He tried to recall his spiritual realm, but to his surprise, he had lost control of it and couldn't retract it.

Han Li's face changed, and he tried to leave the spiritual realm, but when he attempted to exit the range, he found that his spiritual realm had frozen in place, trapping him inside.

"This is troublesome..." Han Li said with a furrowed brow.

It was clear that the fusion of the Jun Tian Ri Huo and the True Speech Treasure Wheel had caused some changes in the Sky Pavilion Array and the spiritual realm, resulting in Han Li's spiritual realm being sealed.

He stood still for a moment, thinking of a plan. Since his spiritual realm was out of control, he needed to regain control of it to solve the current predicament.

However, regaining control of his spiritual realm wasn't easy. The True Speech Treasure Wheel was currently transcending the Creaation Realm, and he needed to solve this problem first.

Han Li's time law power was insufficient, and he couldn't help the True Speech Treasure Wheel complete its transformation smoothly.

Fortunately, the current space had stabilized, and as long as he continued to cultivate the Great Five Elements Fantasy Technique, he could condense more time law power and eventually succeed.

Han Li's heart was filled with a sense of urgency. Time was precious, and if the Sky Pavilion Array was still functioning normally, he would have six thousand years to spare.

This way, he might still be able to escape and rescue Jin Tong before the Wheel of Rebirth took action.

But if the array had stopped working due to the Jun Tian Ri Huo's separation, then he would truly be trapped in this spiritual realm for thousands, or even tens of thousands, of years.

Han Li steeled himself and sat down, continuing to cultivate.

Time passed, and several thousand years went by.

The spiritual realm was filled with golden light, and the air was filled with time law energy.

Han Li, wearing a blue robe, sat on the ground, his hair disheveled, and his eyes filled with a puzzled expression.

"Although the True Speech Treasure Wheel has entered the Heaven Man Realm, and the Jun Tian Ri Huo has merged with it, why..." Han Li muttered to himself, looking around at the still-sealed spiritual realm.

Even after promoting the fusion of the Jun Tian Ri Huo and the True Speech Treasure Wheel, Han Li was still unable to leave the spiritual realm.

"Is it still not enough?" Han Li wondered, his voice barely above a whisper.

Time passed again, and several thousand years went by.

The Sky Pavilion Array's Sanyuan stone should have been depleted, and the True Speech Treasure Wheel should have become substantial. The spiritual realm should have returned to normal, but Han Li was still trapped.

During these thousands of years, Han Li had cultivated tirelessly, and the changes in the spiritual realm had become more pronounced.

The ground had formed mountains and valleys, and a mountain range had taken shape. The scenery was more solid than before, although it still didn't compare to the lush green forests that grew on the mountains.

The River of Time remained unchanged, still looking empty and hollow, and hadn't yet entered the Creation Realm.

"Why... why..." Han Li's hair was disheveled, and his eyes were wild as he shouted at the sky.

With a loud cry, he jumped up and punched the spiritual realm with a golden fist.

A massive golden fist shadow condensed, striking the spiritual realm with a deafening crash.

However, the golden light screen only shook violently for a moment before dissipating into layers of golden light, which eventually disappeared.

Han Li's anger dissipated, and he sat back down, continuing to cultivate.

"Perhaps when the other time law manifestations enter the Creation Realm, I'll be able to break through this predicament?" Han Li thought to himself, still unable to understand the situation.
