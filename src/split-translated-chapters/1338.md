In all the spatial rifts, there was one rift that could be seen to contain a vast expanse of snow.

In the midst of the wind and snow, a white-haired man with two long, slender antennae on his forehead stood, his body almost merging with the snowy white surroundings.

At this moment, he was looking up at this side, his face showing no signs of emotion.

Suddenly, the man smiled, his body suddenly shooting up high, his hands parting in front of him, a faint white glow emerging from between them, directly piercing into the spatial rift.

Immediately, the faint white glow suddenly burst forth, actually tearing open the original several-meter-sized spatial rift, ripping it open to a hundred meters, the white-haired man's body flashing, and he passed through it, entering the extraterritorial space.

As he stepped into the extraterritorial void, a snowy white glow erupted from his body, directly shattering the spatial storm that was sweeping in, and his body flashed, coming to the front of the golden beetle, where he directly clasped his fists together and knelt down.

"I, Frost White, welcome your return, my king," the white-haired man said, his expression excited.

As soon as his words fell, a young woman in a white silk dress, accompanied by several hundred black-armored ant-headed men, stepped out from another rift.

Outside the rift, countless black-armored ant soldiers stood in a dense, orderly formation, guarding the area.

"Frost White, I thought the one who would arrive first would be Qing Feng, but it's actually you, this lazy good-for-nothing," the young woman said with a smile, seeing the white-haired man.

"Feng Zhong..." Frost White replied, looking back at her with a calm expression.

"Still alone, still with that cold, icy demeanor, still... oh, your cultivation has actually increased quite a bit?" the young woman, Feng Zhong, said with a hint of surprise.

In her memory, during the war between the Insect King and the Heavenly Court, most of the eight great generals under the king's throne had died, and among the three who survived, aside from Qing Feng, the one with the most severe injuries was Frost White.

"Back then, I was unable to help the king defeat the enemy, and I was lucky to have survived, how could I not have worked hard to cultivate? Unfortunately, I was still unable to reach the king's level," Frost White said.

"You can think like this, it's already very good," a voice as thin as a mosquito's buzzed from Frost White's shoulder.

Feng Zhong and Frost White were both startled, then relaxed.

A blue wasp, no larger than a finger, flew out from Frost White's shoulder, its body glowing with a faint blue light, and it transformed into a tall, middle-aged man wearing a soft, blue armor, landing in front of the two.

The man looked like a forty-year-old, with a head of long, wavy black hair scattered behind his head, his face tired, with a thick beard, looking like a fallen, drunken bum, with a sleepy expression.

However, his eyes shone with a brilliant light, especially the golden patterns on the outer rim of his pupils, which seemed to have a strange, captivating glow, making it hard to forget.

The black-armored ant soldiers behind Feng Zhong drew their weapons, preparing to surround him.

"Fall back," Feng Zhong raised a hand, stopping the ant soldiers.

"Qing Feng, it seems your concealment techniques have improved again, and we didn't even notice you. When did you arrive here?" Frost White asked, his brow furrowed.

"I received the king's summons, and I immediately came," Qing Feng replied, rubbing his face.

"Have you heard the king's orders?" Feng Zhong asked hastily.

"Not yet, since I arrived, the king hasn't spoken to me," Qing Feng shook his head, looking at the golden beetle.

As soon as his words fell, the golden beetle's body glowed brightly, a woman's virtual image flew out, hovering in mid-air, her eyes shining with a dense, golden light, emotionless, scanning the people in front of her.

The woman's face was quite young, still with a few hints of a girl's features, it was Jin Tong.

"I pay my respects to the Insect Ancestor," Qing Feng and the others were overjoyed, kneeling down to pay their respects.

"Today, this seat will attempt to return to the position of the Dao Ancestor, and I hope you will all protect me, and repel all invading enemies," Jin Tong's gaze swept over the three, her voice emotionless.

"We will not hesitate to die," the three replied in unison, their eyes shining with joyful light.

The woman's virtual image nodded, then retreated, merging back into the golden beetle's body.

In an instant, the golden beetle's body glowed even brighter, emitting a special, pulsating energy that shook the surroundings.

The spatial rifts around them began to shake, transmitting the energy outward.

The spirit insects that had come from the immortal realm became even more frenzied, rushing through the rifts, entering the extraterritorial space, and the golden insects that had been scattered about flew out, rushing towards the golden light.
Among these Gold Devouring Insects, there were both immature larvae and Gold Devouring Immortals who had cultivated to the Taiyi Realm, but there were no more Gold Devouring Immortals of the Daluo level, as they had all merged with the Gold Boy.

"Xuanyuan Jie won't give up easily, we must also prepare ourselves." Qing Feng said after a moment of contemplation.

"This time, even if we're torn to pieces, we absolutely cannot let him threaten the King." Frostwhite's face turned cold as she spoke.

"I'll deploy the insects and set up a formation, you two pay attention to the spatial rifts and don't let the enemy sneak in." Antuo said slowly as she gazed around her surroundings.

"I'll drive away the Heavenly Demons that are lurking in the distance, and leave this place to you two." Qing Feng's gaze shifted, looking towards the distant Heavenly Demon cloud, and said.

As soon as he finished speaking, the exhausted expression on his face suddenly disappeared, and a flash of golden light appeared in his eyes. His entire body's aura disappeared in an instant.

Antuo and Frostwhite blinked, and Qing Feng's figure had vanished.

"He's... stronger than before." Antuo's brow furrowed as she spoke.

Among the three of them, she was the one who had been injured the lightest in the past, and now she was the one with the lowest cultivation level.

Frostwhite saw the guilt and disappointment in her eyes, and spoke to comfort her: "You're skilled at deploying formations, don't worry too much about other things, just do what you need to do."

Antuo nodded, and flew up, entering the front of the Gold Beetle. The Black Armor Ants behind her followed closely.

She gave orders to the ants, and they began to scatter and fly away, merging into the tide of insects surrounding the Gold Beetle.

Before long, the originally chaotic tide of insects began to separate and reorganize, like a disciplined army, and were arranged by Antuo to surround the Gold Boy.

As more and more spiritual insects joined, a massive spiritual insect formation began to take shape.

Frostwhite's gaze concentrated, watching the scene before her, and took a deep breath. A flash of blue light appeared, and a wave of icy white mist spread out, filling the surroundings.

Her divine sense also spread out with the mist, closely observing the situation within the spatial rifts.

As time passed, the tide of insects grew larger and larger, with countless insects that had withstood the pressure of the external space, gathering around the Gold Boy to protect their king.

Under Antuo's command, the tide of insects formed a massive formation, shaped like a giant scorpion, with its two claws, one snow-white and emitting a cold aura, and the other emerald green, burning with a dark green flame.

The scorpion's tail, which was raised high, had a curved hook-like stinger, which flashed with a sharp light.

The Gold Boy was now completely surrounded by golden light, and the beetle's body was no longer visible, only a massive golden light ball, like a precious jewel, was being protected by the scorpion's back.

Just then, a loud, drum-like sound came from the light ball, and a woman's figure appeared, standing on top of the ball. It was the Gold Boy.

She began to hum, and her hands opened, as if welcoming something. A golden whirlpool appeared in front of her, connecting to the golden light ball below.

The spatial rifts around them began to shake violently, and countless Gold Devouring Insects poured in, like a golden waterfall, entering the whirlpool.

The originally dark external space was now filled with a dazzling golden light, as if a sun had appeared, illuminating the surrounding space.

Antuo, standing on the scorpion's head, turned around, and saw the magnificent scene before her. Her face was filled with excitement, and her eyes were moist.

Frostwhite's figure appeared beside her, and said: "We've waited for this moment for endless years, and it's finally here."

Antuo looked at him, and then looked away, asking: "Where's Qing Feng? Hasn't he come back yet?"

"The external Heavenly Demons aren't easy to deal with, but he should be back soon." Frostwhite replied.

Antuo was about to say something, but her expression suddenly changed.

She turned her gaze, and was about to look at the largest spatial rift in front of her, when she saw that Frostwhite had already disappeared, and was rushing towards the rift.

But before Frostwhite could reach it, a dark shadow flashed, and a mountain peak, over a hundred meters high, emerged from the rift, appearing in the external space.

"Bad!"

Antuo's expression changed, and she flew up, but didn't rush towards the mountain peak. Instead, she commanded the scorpion to raise its claws, preparing for battle.
