"What's going on?"

Han Li's transformed giant demon saw this and changed its expression.

The next moment, the white light screen flashed again, and the depressed area suddenly returned to its original state.

The giant demon's body shook violently, and it was blown away again, retreating over a dozen steps before stabilizing its body. It looked at the white light screen in shock, its face filled with a heavy expression.

As for the attacking power of its cultivation method, the "Tian Sha Zhen Yu Gong" was the strongest, but it couldn't break through this light screen. What could be done?

Han Li still had some other methods, but judging from the current situation, it was likely to be useless.

The Jing Yan Tong Zi suddenly let out a sharp cry, transforming into a firebird shape once again, and was about to fly out.

At this moment, the nearby misty sea surged violently again, and a muffled sound came from within.

The white light on the Jing Yan firebird's body flashed again, and the white fireball automatically flew out once more, its light intensifying.

Han Li's expression changed slightly, and he looked back.

Could it be that the last array eye had been broken?

Although he had expected it, he didn't think it would happen so quickly. This way, the time left for him was limited.

If he couldn't break through the obstruction in front of him in a short time, there would be many variables.

As soon as he thought of this, Han Li turned back, looking at the white light screen in front of him.

And at this moment, a shocking scene appeared!

The white light screen, which was almost impossible to destroy, suddenly burst into a dazzling white light, flashing violently twice, and then rapidly thinned out, shattering with a "bang" sound, turning into a multitude of white light streams that flew towards the sky, disappearing in an instant.

Han Li was stunned, almost unable to believe his eyes.

"Could it be that the five array eyes have been broken, and this light screen restriction will disappear?"

He thought of this, looking down.

...

At this moment, on a small peak of the Qian Tian Giant Peak, two figures stood behind a large stone, and it was Lei Yu Ce and Su Xi.

A layer of white light enveloped the two, with a white light screen above that was flashing with a mist-like white light, looking exceptionally mysterious.

In front of the small peak, over a hundred miles away, a green palace could be seen, but it had already collapsed.

Two blue lights flew out of the ruins, and it was Lan Yuan Zi and Lan Yan.

The two lights merged into one, and their speed increased instantly, disappearing into the distance.

As soon as the two figures disappeared, a group of black figures flew out, all emitting powerful demonic energy.

In the midst of cheering, these demonic cultivators also flew towards the distance, disappearing quickly, and the surroundings became quiet.

Lei Yu Ce waved his hand, and the white light screen enveloping the two disappeared, turning into a white circle that flew into his sleeve.

"Lei Yu Ce, why didn't you let me go out and stop them? With our combined strength, we might have had a chance to protect this place!" Su Xi looked at Lei Yu Ce, her voice serious.

"It's impossible, Lan Yuan Zi and Lan Yan's strength are not below ours, and they have that blue pouch. We can't be their opponents, and forcing a fight would only lead to loss. If I were alone, it would be fine, but since you're here, I can't take risks." Lei Yu Ce sighed.

Su Xi's mouth moved, and a complex expression flashed in her eyes, before she fell silent.

"The wood array eye has been broken, and now all five array eyes have been broken. What do we do now?" she asked worriedly.

"I have a plan, don't worry. Let's go repair the array first." Lei Yu Ce's eyes flashed with an unusual color, and he said, before flying towards the collapsed palace.

Su Xi hesitated, looking at Lei Yu Ce's back, her eyebrows furrowed, before following him.

...

At the top of the Qian Tian Giant Peak, Han Li withdrew his gaze, and his body flew forward, "whooshing" out of the white misty sea. His vision suddenly expanded.

Before him, the sky was a bright blue, with white clouds, and the Qian Tian Giant Peak finally reached its peak. The golden light floated in the air above the peak.

At this moment, without the white light screen and mist blocking his view, Han Li finally saw that the golden light was a massive palace, towering high, with an extraordinary aura.

He looked at the palace, his eyes lighting up, and he flew towards it.
The sky suddenly became turbulent, a white cloud cluster emerged, and countless white light flashes danced within, just like the previous white light screen.

The nearby heavenly energy surged towards the white cloud cluster, which rapidly expanded and covered the entire sky in an instant.

Within the white clouds, thunder rumbled, and white electric arcs began to move, exerting a massive pressure, as if the heavens were enraged.

Below the clouds, a fierce wind howled, sweeping across the giant peak, shattering rocks and uprooting trees, as the misty sea churned and rolled, exuding a sense of slaughter.

Han Li's expression changed, and he stopped in his tracks, about to examine the situation in the sky.

A series of loud explosions erupted from the white clouds, and the clouds began to churn violently, as white electric arcs suddenly intensified, and long, thick white lightning bolts struck down, targeting the giant peak.

The white lightning was scorching hot, almost impossible to gaze at directly, and it contained a massive lightning law, making Han Li's heart tremble with fear.

Moreover, this lightning law was filled with the intent of heavenly punishment, similar to the heavenly punishment lightning he had seen before, but with a power that was over a hundred times stronger.

Han Li's face turned pale, and he was about to retract his giant demon transformation and dodge, but it was too late, as over a dozen thick white lightning bolts pierced through the void, striking him.

A heavenly punishment descended, carrying an aura of destruction, as if the heavens intended to annihilate him and crush his rebellious spirit.

The heavens wanted to kill him, and he could not defy it!

Han Li's consciousness was suppressed by this aura, but the next moment, his massive spiritual power burst forth, shattering the suppression, just as the white lightning bolts reached him.

The giant demon let out a roar, its body glowing with light, as it rapidly plummeted downwards, barely gaining a moment's time.

At the same time, the giant demon's six fists glowed with black light, becoming blurry and transforming into countless illusory shadows that struck the white lightning bolts.

In an instant, a deafening howl erupted!

The dense black fist shadows appeared in the void, each radiating an aura of terrifying magic and immense power, as if they could shatter the void, creating visible white scars and spatial rifts.

The fist shadows collided with the lightning, but instead of a deafening explosion, they seemed to melt away like ice in fire, dissolving into wispy black smoke.

The white lightning bolts effortlessly pierced through the black fist shadows, striking the giant demon's body with a loud crash.

The giant demon's body was ravaged, its massive form crashing into the ground, creating a massive crater, as rocks and debris flew everywhere.

White electric arcs enveloped the giant demon's body, crackling with energy, as the magic within it dissipated, vanishing in an instant.

As the magic dissipated, the giant demon transformation collapsed, and Han Li's true form reappeared.

At that moment, his face was pale, and his body was covered in deep wounds, as if he had been struck by lightning, but fortunately, he had managed to avoid the vital points.

Han Li quickly consumed a blood-red medicinal pill, and his wounds began to heal at an incredible rate, as the blood glow flashed across his body.

The white clouds in the sky thinned out, and the white electric arcs diminished, but the second wave of white lightning bolts struck down, their power undiminished.

Han Li's expression remained calm, as a golden light enveloped his body, and a golden electric arc spread across his skin.

The True Speak Bead appeared, radiating golden ripples that enveloped his body, as he prepared to face the second wave of lightning.

The first wave had caught him off guard, but he was ready for the second wave, and he was confident that he could withstand the white lightning bolts, even if they were twice as powerful.

However, the second wave of lightning did not strike Han Li, but instead fell towards other areas, disappearing into the misty sea, as the sound of distant, muffled explosions echoed through the air.

Han Li's eyes widened as he realized that the white lightning bolts were targeting those with magical auras, and that the Taishang Xianzun had anticipated the destruction of the five array eyes, leaving behind a countermeasure, transforming the white light screen into a lightning screen, and unleashing the white lightning bolts to annihilate the escaping demons.

The white lightning bolts seemed to be a specialized lightning technique, designed to counter magical auras, which explained why his "Tianxia Town Prison" technique had been at a disadvantage against them.

Han Li's eyes lit up with understanding as he realized that he had been mistaken for a demon due to the magical aura on his body, and that the white lightning bolts had targeted him as a result.

He had since retracted his transformation and isolated his aura using the time and lightning laws, and was no longer a target for the white lightning bolts.

With this newfound understanding, Han Li felt a mix of admiration and trepidation towards the Taishang Xianzun, and he stood still, unwilling to make a move.

As the white cloud cluster in the sky began to dissipate, the third wave of lightning bolts formed, and a series of thick white lightning bolts struck down, their numbers decreasing with each wave.

The fourth wave, the fifth wave, and the sixth wave of white lightning bolts fell, until the white cloud cluster finally dissipated, and the sky returned to its calm state, as if nothing had happened.
