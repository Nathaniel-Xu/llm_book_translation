Near the tower, Lei Yu Ce and Wen Zhong stood side by side, quietly watching the scene before them.

"Lei Dao You, how confident are you in this method?" Wen Zhong asked in a low voice.

"Even if it's not 90% certain, 67% is still possible. Besides, to obtain the Years Lamp, even if there's only a 10% chance, I'd still want to try. Isn't that what you're thinking, Wen Dao You?" Lei Yu Ce's eyes flashed with a hint of sharpness as he replied.

"According to rumors, the Years Lamp is a divine artifact forged by the Ta Sui Celestial after a lifetime of effort. Who knows what kind of treasure it is?" Wen Zhong's face showed a hint of expectation.

"Speaking of which, Lei Vice Master, your affection for Su Wan is your personal matter, but the Years Lamp concerns the future development of the Tong Tian Sword Sect. You mustn't let personal feelings get in the way of important matters," Wen Zhong said, his eyes narrowing slightly.

"Don't worry, as Vice Master, I naturally understand what to do," Lei Yu Ce replied, his brow furrowed.

"Good," Wen Zhong's expression relaxed.

Under the busy hands of nearly a hundred people, the array patterns on the ground were quickly etched. In just half a day, the area in front of the gray tower was filled with two enormous black and white arrays.

The two arrays complemented each other, forming a yin-yang pattern.

"This is..." Han Li, mixed in with the crowd, looked at the arrays before him, his eyes flashing with insight. He quickly connected with Ti Huo and Jing Yan Tong Zi.

After a few breaths, he emitted a hot and cold aura mixed together.

"Everyone, this is the dual-array design created by the Alliance Master to break the tower's seal. Each array requires fifty cultivators to activate. I'll now select the participants," Wen Zhong announced, hovering in mid-air.

The crowd of cultivators gathered before the tower, numbering over a thousand, stirred with unease. No one dared to speak out, only praying silently that they wouldn't be chosen.

Anyone could see the terror of the tower's seal, and breaking it would undoubtedly be perilous.

Wen Zhong saw the crowd's expressions and knew their thoughts. He smiled coldly and began to directly select the participants.

"You, you, you..."

Each person he pointed out was shot with a beam of white light, which lingered on their body.

In a short time, the Alliance cultivators had selected a hundred people, although they weren't very willing. These people, however, stepped forward.

The selected hundred cultivators had varying levels of cultivation, from Tai Yi to Golden Immortal, and even True Immortal. However, they all shared one characteristic: they cultivated either extreme yang or yin techniques, each accounting for half.

"Indeed, it's a yin-yang dual-array..." Han Li's eyes flashed with insight as he muttered to himself.

If it were an ordinary day, taking some risks to activate the array for treasure would be acceptable. But he was currently being secretly watched, and he couldn't afford to enter the array. So, he used his secret technique to transfer some of the essence of Ti Huo and Jing Yan Tong Zi into his body, creating a mixed aura.

Han Li had previously traveled with Yu Kuo Hai and the others for a few days, but he hadn't openly revealed his cultivation technique. His aura changed slightly, but it didn't arouse the suspicions of the three.

On the other side, the Lan siblings cultivated techniques with yin-cold attributes. Although they used secret techniques to conceal their true cultivation, their aura itself couldn't be changed, and they were selected into the yin-attribute group of fifty.

Perhaps to avoid complications, they reluctantly followed orders.

"This is terrible luck..." Lan Yan sat at a node within the black array, complaining in a low voice.

"Just endure it for now, and be careful not to reveal your true cultivation," Lan Yuan Zi replied.

"I know, brother. Don't worry, this level of array is nothing to worry about," Lan Yan guaranteed.

"Excuse me, Wen Senior, is there any danger in activating this dual-array to break the seal?" a black-robed middle-aged man asked, his voice trembling.

"Exploring the treasure realm's secrets, how could there be no danger? If you're so afraid of death, why did you come here in the first place?" Wen Zhong glanced at the man, his expression cold.

The black-robed man's face turned bright red, and he quickly lowered his head, not daring to speak again.

"You don't need to worry too much. This time, breaking the tower's seal is a matter of using an array to break an array. Although there's some danger, it should be manageable. Besides, all participants will be rewarded by the Alliance afterward. You won't be working for nothing," Wen Zhong said, his voice carrying as he tried to reassure the crowd.

Upon hearing this, the cultivators' expressions slightly improved.

"Let's begin!" Lei Yu Ce said, hovering above the two arrays.

The arrays on the ground began to rotate, emitting bright black and white light.

The cultivators within the arrays were restricted by a powerful seal, unable to move. At the same time, the arrays emitted a devouring force, rapidly absorbing their spiritual energy.

The cultivators' hearts skipped a beat, but they soon realized that aside from the absorption of spiritual energy, there were no other abnormalities. They gradually calmed down.

Lei Yu Ce carefully observed the operation of the two arrays, seeing that everything was proceeding smoothly. He nodded slightly and then joined his hands together before separating them again.

The arrays continued to rotate, emitting even more intense black and white light.
The black and white spell arrays each shone brightly, and immediately, a hundred or so thick black and white light bands flew out from the two arrays, rushing towards the gray stone gate of the giant tower.

The lightning seal on the stone gate seemed to sense the threat, and suddenly brightened, with thick gray and black lightning bolts appearing, each emitting a wave of law power, cutting through the black and white light bands.

The black and white light bands were like paper, instantly torn apart and scattered.

"What a powerful yin lightning!" Han Li exclaimed, his pupils shrinking as he spoke.

The law power emitted by this yin lightning was completely opposite to the thunder law power born from the Qingzhu Fengyun sword.

The thunder law power within the Qingzhu Fengyun sword had inherited the characteristics of the evil-warding divine thunder, being strong and masculine, while these black lightning bolts were the opposite, emitting a strong yin evil aura.

If possible, he would like to study these yin lightning bolts.

Lei Yu Ce, however, did not react, seemingly having anticipated this, and he muttered to himself, his hands flying quickly to form a seal.

The black and white spell arrays on the ground suddenly burst with light, increasing in brightness by more than tenfold, forming a hundred giant black and white light columns.

A surging yin-yang energy was emitted from the two giant light columns.

Lei Yu Ce formed a seal, and a black and white flag flew out from his body, floating above his head.

The white flag had a sun pattern embroidered on it, while the black flag had a moon pattern, both emitting a shocking spiritual power wave, as well as law power waves, clearly being high-quality immortal artifacts.

He raised his hands, and the black and white flags rotated rapidly in the air.

The black and white light columns were affected by the black and white flags, and they began to entwine and rotate together, faster and faster, forming a massive black and white dual-colored whirlwind.

The whirlwind emitted a dazzling black and white light, and a strong law power wave.

"Go!" Lei Yu Ce shouted, pushing his hands forward.

The black and white whirlwind immediately rushed forward, sweeping towards the base of the gray giant tower, rapidly rotating.

A loud rumbling sound echoed out.

The gray and black lightning around the gray giant tower surged again, even more violently than before, with countless gray and black lightning bolts appearing, striking the black and white whirlwind, emitting a sound like iron sheets rubbing against each other.

Especially on the stone gate, even more gray and black lightning bolts appeared, like giant dragons, extremely frightening, and the void around them shattered.

However, the black and white whirlwind did not shatter like the previous black and white light bands, but instead, as it rotated rapidly, it sucked in the gray and black lightning bolts.

The gray and black lightning bolts were like fish caught in a net, unable to escape no matter how hard they struggled.

The cultivators around them cheered at the sight.

The black and white spell arrays suddenly erupted, and the immortal spiritual energy within the people inside the arrays surged out like a tide, and a wave of yin evil lightning power was transmitted through the air, causing the people inside the arrays to reveal painful expressions.

Lan Yan's eyebrows furrowed, feeling a wave of yin evil lightning power transmitted into her body, like countless small insects biting her meridians, extremely painful.

However, she had deep cultivation, and could still withstand it, but her heart was secretly complaining.

Among the crowd, Han Li gazed at the hundred cultivators inside the arrays, his eyes flashing with a hint of light, and his divine sense quietly spread out.

Although it was not good to suspect that the person controlling the arrays was working hard, the opportunity was too good to pass up, and if the person being tracked was inside the arrays, now was the best time to investigate.

In mid-air, Lei Yu Ce's hands flew quickly to form a seal, and the black and white whirlwind rotated rapidly, slowly rising upwards.

The lightning bolts that were sucked in were also brought upwards, and the lightning flower patterns on the tower's surface dimmed, no longer emitting gray and black lightning bolts, as if the yin lightning power above had also been taken away.

After a short while, the black and white whirlwind had risen over ten zhang, and stopped.

Although it was only a short while, to the hundred people inside the arrays, it seemed like an eternity, and some people with shallow cultivation had their internal energy drained, and they fell to the ground, bleeding from their seven orifices.

At this moment, the people around them were all struggling to withstand the pain, and naturally, they didn't care about the lives of those around them, and the people outside were all changing color, with some people secretly rejoicing that they hadn't been chosen to enter the arrays, but more people's gazes were fixed on the gray giant tower.

As more and more gray and black lightning bolts appeared from the gray giant tower's seal, striking the black and white whirlwind, it seemed that the actions of the crowd had completely enraged the seal.

The black and white whirlwind was still rotating rapidly, blocking all the lightning bolts, but it was clearly slower than before.

Below the whirlwind, the stone gate of the giant tower appeared, and the gray and black lightning bolts on it had disappeared, leaving only a thin layer of crystal clear light, covering the stone gate.

This layer of crystal clear light was similar to the transparent seal at the entrance of the secret realm, and it looked even thicker.
