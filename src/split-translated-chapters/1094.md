Everyone was shocked and looked towards the sound, only to see a giant demon with a height of ten zhang, covered in white bones, flying out of the cave entrance and hovering above the grand hall.

As everyone saw the demon's appearance, they couldn't help but take a deep breath.

Its entire body was covered in white bones, as white as jade, with no skin or internal organs. Its massive head was unlike that of a human, resembling a goat's skull, and it had two white bone wings on its back, connected by a transparent wing membrane. The wings flapped continuously, creating a whooshing sound.

Han Li released his spiritual sense to scan the demon and found that its aura was no weaker than that of the previous Copper Lion Demon. He furrowed his brow slightly.

"Are you the ones who released me?" the white bone demon asked, its eyes scanning the crowd below.

Han Li and the others didn't know what it meant, so they didn't respond. They just stared at the demon with caution.

Seeing no one answering, the white bone demon's gaze fell upon the blue bag in Lan Yan's hand. Its eyes, a deep blue, seemed to gleam with interest.

"Since you have this item, it's clear that you're the ones who opened the seal. I, a demon, am not ungrateful or without etiquette. You have done me a favor, so I'll give you these precious stones as a gift." The white bone demon spoke, its hand waving, and a blue light flashed from its fingertips.

Seven or eight fist-sized blue crystals flew out of the air, each containing a dense, water-attribute law. It was clear that they were no ordinary objects.

Everyone's expressions changed slightly.

They weren't surprised by the rarity of the blue crystals, but rather by the white bone demon's actions.

"Hmph! You don't even say a word or accept the gift, and you're already leaving? That's quite rude." The white bone demon's voice grew cold, its words dripping with disdain.

With a wave of its hand, the blue crystals were enveloped by a powerful force and shot towards the crowd.

Accompanied by a loud whooshing sound, the blue crystals flew towards the crowd, their cores suddenly glowing with a dark, black light. The light expanded rapidly, exploding into a massive shockwave.

The shockwave was so powerful that it seemed to corrode the air itself, producing a hissing sound that made everyone's teeth ache.

Han Li and the others had anticipated this, so they quickly retreated, using their various techniques to defend themselves.

"You refuse my gift, so I'll give you a penalty instead. Let's have some fun..." The white bone demon sneered, its voice dripping with malice.

As it spoke, the entire mountain cliff collapsed, and a group of massive demons flew out of the ground, charging towards Han Li and the others.

Since the outside of the mountain was surrounded by a restrictive barrier, the group couldn't retreat far. Seeing the demons approach, they decided to stand their ground and charge forward.

Han Li's wrist flicked, and a green bamboo sword appeared in his hand. He charged towards a demon with a powerful aura, comparable to that of a late-stage Taiyi cultivator.

The sword sliced through the air, leaving behind a trail of golden light. A golden lightning bolt erupted from the sword, striking the demon's head.

However, the demon's head didn't split open as expected. Instead, a blinding golden light flashed on its forehead, colliding with the golden lightning bolt. The demon's neck was forced downwards, and then it bounced back, repelling Han Li's sword.

The demon's two heads on either side opened their mouths, letting out a shrill scream. Two spiral-shaped golden waves erupted from their mouths, charging towards Han Li.

However, the golden waves suddenly slowed down, as if they had been frozen in place.

Han Li's body glowed with a golden light as he dodged the attack. He appeared behind the demon, his sword flashing with golden light as he struck its heart.

A burst of golden electricity erupted from the sword, and the demon's wound began to spasm. A silver flame erupted from the outside, engulfing the demon.

The entire process seemed to take a long time, but in reality, it was completed in an instant, thanks to Han Li's time manipulation technique. The demon was killed instantly, thanks to the combined attack of the demon-slaying lightning and the silver flame.

In contrast to Han Li's solo battle, Lan Yuanzi and Lan Yan were facing a more intense fight. Seven or eight demons, all at the Taiyi stage, were surrounding them, seemingly interested in the blue bag in Lan Yan's hand.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he realized that the blue bag was likely a treasure, similar to the golden sword that Xiong Shan had used to suppress the altar's restriction.

The demons were too powerful, and Lan Yuanzi and Lan Yan were forced to retreat, their movements becoming more and more disorganized.
Han Li hesitated for a moment, just as he was about to step forward to help, he saw Lanyan suddenly focus her gaze, raise her hand to grasp the blue cloth bag, and point at it with a finger.

A blue light flashed from her fingertip, and the blue cloth bag began to violently expand and contract, with thunderous roars emanating from the opening. A blue light vortex suddenly appeared from within.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he gazed at the opening of the bag, his eyes flashing with a hint of surprise. He saw that within the vortex, there were flashes of lightning, and it seemed to be a Water Thunder Array.

At this moment, Lanyan and Lanyuanzi stood back-to-back, suddenly tilting the bag's opening towards the surrounding gathering of demons, and let out a fierce cry: "Go!"

As soon as the cry sounded, the blue light vortex at the bag's opening began to rapidly spin, and seven or eight blue water dragons burst out once more, charging towards the demons and biting at them.

Just then, Lanyan's expression suddenly changed, her face turning deathly pale, and she looked as if she had exhausted her spiritual energy.

Han Li witnessed this, and his heart skipped a beat.

This blue cloth bag was certainly a divine artifact, but just how high was its rank, to be able to cause such a massive consumption of spiritual energy? From her appearance, it seemed that not only was her spiritual energy depleted, but also her law energy had been severely drained.

In comparison, the earlier scene of Xiongshan, who had activated the ancient sword of the Wasteland, seemed even more bizarre.

Han Li was pondering this when another demon suddenly pounced towards him. He coldly snorted, and with his sword, he charged forward to meet the demon.

The blue water dragons' movements were swift and decisive, and as they moved, the surrounding air seemed to be shrouded by a layer of water-attribute law energy, sealing off the demons' escape routes.

Several demons that were too close were caught off guard, and were directly bitten by the blue water dragons.

The demons let out strange cries, and frantically struggled to break free, but were unable to escape the water dragons, and were pulled back, flying away.

As they flew back, their bodies began to rapidly shrink, and by the time they reached the bag's opening, they had already been reduced to the size of a pellet, and were all pulled into the bag.

The demons were immediately caught in the Water Thunder Array within the bag, and the blue light vortex began to churn and boil, with thunderous roars shaking the air.

However, within a few breaths, the blue cloth bag began to emit pitiful wails, mixed with the sounds of thunder and lightning.

And in just a moment, all the sounds ceased, and the demons had already been completely turned to dust.

Lanyan, who had activated the bag, seemed to have been instantly drained of all her energy, and her body went limp, collapsing to the ground.

Lanyuanzi quickly supported her, and took the blue cloth bag from her hand, flipping it over to retrieve a water-blue pill, which he fed to her.

The white-boned demon saw this, and let out a fierce cry, and the remaining demons, seeing this, immediately stopped their attacks, and fled in all directions.

The white-boned demon glanced at the group, and then turned to flee, its bony wings fluttering as it brought the remaining demons with it.

The group tidied up, and then reassembled.

Lei Yu's gaze fell upon the blue cloth bag in Lanyuanzi's hand, and his expression turned somewhat unsightly. He hesitated for a long time, but ultimately did not say anything, and instead, he bowed to the group, saying: "Everyone, please wait, this forbidden area's array has been severely damaged, and repairing it will take some time. You can use this opportunity to search the surroundings, and see if there are any remaining treasures."

After saying this, he didn't care about the others' reactions, and brought Wen Zhong to repair the array.

Lanyuanzi and his sister did not move, and instead, sat down to meditate and recover.

Lanyan's consumption seemed to be even more severe than imagined, and even after taking the pill, her face still looked very bad. Lanyuanzi gazed at her with a pained expression, and his eyes fell upon the blue cloth bag in his hand, and he seemed to be hesitant.

Han Li watched for a moment, and then, like the others, began to search the surroundings.

However, the great hall had already been severely damaged, and the mountain cliff was already in a state of disrepair. The group searched, but only found some water-attribute materials, and nothing else.

After about a quarter of an hour, Lei Yu and Wen Zhong returned, and said: "Everyone, the array at the altar has been repaired, and we can continue on our journey."

After saying this, he called out to Su Zhencai, and the three of them flew off together, continuing towards the mountain peak.

Jiao San and the others followed closely behind, and also flew off.

Han Li was about to follow the group, but seemed to have a sudden feeling, and turned his head to look at a distant place, and then furrowed his brow, looking puzzled.

He pondered for a moment, but still couldn't understand, and so he shook his head, and continued on his way.
