In the deafening roar, the cave was hit by a black-red light, and it immediately collapsed, causing the ground to shake and mountains to tremble. Countless huge rocks fell down, instantly burying Han Li and the others.

Fortunately, Han Li and the others knew some earth escape techniques, and in the instant the cave collapsed, they immediately used their techniques to escape into the ground.

But just as the few people entered the ground, a strange and eerie laugh echoed from underground, causing everyone's hearts to tremble.

Immediately, a huge black claw, as big as a house, emerged from the depths of the earth, grabbing towards the group with lightning speed.

The owner of the giant claw was a massive monster, resembling a lizard, but much larger and more bloated.

This beast was hiding underground, its breath and the surrounding soil and rocks were indistinguishable, and it suddenly launched a surprise attack on the group, without any warning.

Lei Yu and the others didn't discover the monster hiding underground, and they were too late to resist. Just as they were about to be caught by the black claw, Han Li's eyes flashed with a cold light, and he pointed his finger.

With a "hiss" sound, a dazzling golden lightning bolt shot out, striking the black claw.

This golden lightning bolt was tiny compared to the black claw, but as soon as they touched, the black claw was easily torn apart like paper.

The golden lightning bolt shattered the black claw and didn't stop, flashing onto the black monster's chest, creating a hole the size of a water barrel.

The lizard monster let out a blood-curdling scream, its massive body shrank violently, and it tried to escape into the ground.

But at this moment, Lei Yu and the others also reacted, launching a barrage of attacks that rained down on the lizard monster, instantly turning its body into a sieve, killing it.

Its corpse, like the wolf-type monsters, dissipated into a black mist, which spread rapidly in all directions, staining the surrounding soil and rocks black.

Han Li and the others were close by, and they were immediately affected by the black mist. They quickly opened their protective light circles, blocking the mist.

Kong Shan, who was standing at the back of the group, also had a layer of golden light appear around his body, protecting him.

The black mist surged forward, but was blocked by the golden light.

However, in that moment, a very thin black light shot out from the surrounding mist, silently piercing Kong Shan's protective golden light, and entering his body.

In the chaos, Kong Shan didn't notice, and the others didn't either.

After killing the lizard monster, the group didn't stop, and they continued to move forward, eventually emerging from the ground.

"I'm sorry, because of my fault, you all fell into danger, and almost got hurt. I'm truly sorry," Wen Zhong said apologetically.

"Wen friend, don't be so self-critical, we didn't recognize those wolf-type monsters, who could have known that those beads would explode? Ah, Han friend, you seemed to recognize those things, but what are they?" Su Qi comforted him, then asked Han Li.

The others looked at Han Li, waiting for his answer.

"Those wolf-type monsters are a type of demon beast from the Demon Realm, called Corpse Devil Wolves. It's not surprising that you don't recognize them, as they are not well-known. These beasts have Corpse Fire Beads inside them, which can't be contaminated by other energies, or they will explode immediately," Han Li explained.

" Demon Realm demon beast? No wonder," the group exclaimed.

But since Han Li recognized the beast, had he been to the Demon Realm before?

The group was curious, but they didn't dare ask, and it wasn't the right time to investigate. They continued to move forward, following the cave.

After another moment, the front of the cave suddenly brightened, and a vast open space appeared before them, much larger than the previous cave.

The open space was filled with piles of golden minerals, ranging from small to large, with the largest ones as tall as mountains, and the smallest ones only a few feet high. They seemed to be arranged in a deliberate pattern, forming a stone array.

The group exchanged a glance, seeing the seriousness in each other's eyes, and they proceeded with caution, entering the stone array.

Fortunately, nothing happened as they entered the array, and they continued to move forward, eventually walking out of the array.

In front of them, a small plaza appeared, with a golden altar in the center. The altar was over a hundred feet tall, with three layers, and was made of a golden material that seemed to be naturally formed, without any signs of construction.

At the top of the altar was a golden platform, with a golden Taiji diagram engraved on it. On one side of the diagram was a dark golden ancient sword, with a triangular shape, and engravings of sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, and dragons.

A brilliant golden light emanated from the ancient sword, containing the laws of gold, which made the group feel a piercing pain, as if they were being cut open.

On the other side of the Taiji diagram, a golden flame the size of a human head floated, emitting strong temporal law fluctuations.

Golden symbols extended from the Taiji diagram, covering the entire altar, forming a cage-like formation.
The Golden Rule and the Time Rule intertwined, not only did they not conflict, but they were extremely harmonious, enveloping the entire altar.

However, a massive crack appeared on the altar, and inside, it was pitch black, with a faint, cold wind blowing out, emitting a mournful howl, as if it came from the depths of the underworld.

The stone array surrounding the square seemed to have a shielding effect, as before, when they were inside the array, they had not noticed the altar's existence. Now, as they exited the array, a massive aura enveloped them, and everyone's movements were momentarily frozen.

"What is this? A seal?" Su Zi stared at the golden altar, her eyes wide with wonder, and muttered to herself.

Hou San and Jiao San also stared at the golden altar, their faces pale with shock.

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise as he examined the altar, his gaze quickly moving to the ancient sword and the golden flame on top.

"This ancient sword's material is the same as the Tian Jin Drill I saw before! No wonder it has such a sharp aura! And the golden flame, it contains the power of the Time Rule, which is quite unusual, with a sense of time flowing like a river... it's completely different from the five elemental laws of the Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue..." He thought to himself, his mind captivated by the two objects on the altar.

Compared to the others, Lei Yu Ce and Wen Zhong appeared relatively calm, exchanging a glance, with a hint of excitement in their eyes.

At the back of the group, Xiong Shan stared at the golden ancient sword on top of the altar, his eyes filled with an intense longing, his breathing becoming heavy.

He glanced at Han Li and the others, and his body suddenly shot forward, his golden light surging, transforming into a giant golden hand that grasped towards the ancient sword.

"Xiong Dao friend, don't be rash!"

Everyone's faces changed as they witnessed the scene, especially Lei Yu Ce and Wen Zhong, who were shocked, and cried out, "Ah!"

However, it was too late, and the golden hand grasped the ancient sword, which suddenly burst forth with golden sword light, cutting through the golden hand with ease.

Not only that, the golden ancient sword seemed to be enraged, its body vibrating with a humming sound, emitting a series of sword cries, and a multitude of crystal sword auras shot out in all directions.

Han Li and the others were immediately enveloped by a wave of sharp sword intent, their faces changing, as they hastily cast spells to defend themselves.

The Lan siblings immediately stood back-to-back, and Lan Yuanzi spat out a blue orb, which expanded into a blue, ball-shaped light shield, covering himself and Lan Yan.

Jiao San and Hou San saw this and followed suit, with Jiao San tossing out a small, white shield that rapidly expanded, forming a white light shield to protect the two of them.

Lei Yu Ce and Wen Zhong also quickly joined hands, their hands waving in unison, as they released a multitude of small, golden flags that surrounded them, forming a golden light array.

A dazzling golden light burst forth from the flags, creating a golden light array that enveloped Lei Yu Ce and Wen Zhong.

"Su Xianzi, quickly enter the array!" Lei Yu Ce called out to Su Zi, who was standing nearby, preparing to cast a spell.

The golden light array immediately expanded, enveloping Su Zi, and changing its shape from a circle to an ellipse.

Su Zi's eyes flashed with a complex expression, but she did not resist, allowing the golden light to envelop her.

However, she waved her hand, releasing a blue, large banner.

A blue wave emanated from the banner, forming a blue light shield that enveloped the three of them, adding another layer of defense.

Han Li also let out a low cry, as the light from the 900-plus acupoints on his body flashed, and a thick, crystalline membrane formed around him, which was the Zhen Ji membrane.

Not only that, he waved his hand, and the golden lightning from his sleeve flashed, as the 36 Qing Zhu Bi Yun swords flew out, forming a golden sword curtain, with electric arcs swirling around it.

Han Li had just finished setting up his defenses when the sharp, crystal sword auras shot towards him, striking the golden sword curtain.

The golden sword curtain violently shook, emitting a series of explosive sounds, and shooting out countless sparks.

The 36 Qing Zhu Bi Yun swords on the curtain shot out sparks, although they were not destroyed, the originally neat and orderly sword array was on the verge of collapse.

Han Li's face changed, and he, along with the sword array, flew backward, as he let out a loud cry, his hands spreading apart, and a multitude of thick, golden electric arcs appeared around him, merging with the sword array.

The sword array, which was on the verge of collapse, immediately stabilized, but several crystal sword auras managed to sneak in before it stabilized, striking Han Li's body.

The Zhen Ji membrane on Han Li's body flashed, its surface becoming smooth like a mirror, as it blocked the sword auras with a series of muffled sounds.

The Zhen Ji membrane's power increased with the number of acupoints opened, and Han Li, who had opened over 900 acupoints, had a defense that surpassed any of his magical artifacts.

Han Li also flew out of the sword aura's range, his body falling onto a nearby stone pile.
