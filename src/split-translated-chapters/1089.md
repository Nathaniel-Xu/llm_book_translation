"You're looking for death! A small Golden Immortal, thinking you can show off with just one divine sword! Go cultivate for another million years!" The long-bearded burly man seemed to be enraged by Xiong Shan's arrogant attitude, and a black light flashed in his hand, revealing a black knife with a skull-like head on its hilt.

The knife's body was long and narrow, with lightning-shaped patterns engraved on it, emitting a faint black glow. The aura emanating from it was even more powerful than the previous Xuanming Divine Hammer.

As the long-bearded man swung his arm, a powerful slash was unleashed.

"Whoosh!"

A massive amount of black energy burst forth from the black knife, transforming into a black cloud that swept towards the golden sword light. Simultaneously, over a hundred lightning-shaped black crystal threads shot out, converging on a single point.

A loud crackling sound filled the air!

The black lightning flashed, and a house-sized black lightning lion materialized, its four legs flying towards the incoming golden sword light.

A surge of cold and violent thunder laws erupted from the black lightning lion, causing the air to shudder and tremble. Xiong Shan's sword light, however, remained unwavering, as if ready to clash with the lion to the death.

The next moment, the sword light and the lightning lion collided, unleashing a massive explosion of black and golden light.

The entire cave shook violently, but the stone walls surrounding it were reinforced with seals, and a layer of golden light emanated from the walls, preventing them from collapsing.

With a loud "crack!", the black lightning lion was cleaved in two, its body disintegrating into a multitude of black lightning crystal threads that scattered everywhere.

The long-bearded man stumbled backward, his face filled with disbelief.

However, the thunder laws from the lightning lion rebounded, and the golden sword light vanished. Xiong Shan stumbled out, his face even paler than before, but his eyes still shone with a crazed fervor.

Han Li, who had been watching from a distance, couldn't help but feel a hint of surprise.

Xiong Shan, a mere Golden Immortal, had managed to break through the long-bearded man's attack, a Taiyi realm expert, using the ancient sword he had just obtained. Han Li had previously judged the sword's power to be around a fourth-grade divine artifact, but now he realized it was likely a third-grade divine artifact.

Han Li couldn't help but feel envious of the sword's power and its perfect compatibility with Xiong Shan's laws.

The long-bearded man and Han Li, Xiong Shan exchanged blows in a flash, while the other demonic cultivators were still reacting to the sudden turn of events.

It was only natural for the demonic cultivators to be hostile towards the cultivators from the immortal realm, especially the humans. These cultivators had been imprisoned by the Taishang Xianzun for who-knew-how-many years, accumulating boundless resentment.

As the demonic cultivators charged towards Han Li and the others, nearly half of them, however, were more concerned with escaping the Taishang Tower than attacking. They transformed into black lights and flew away, disappearing into the distance.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed as he watched the scene unfold, but he quickly grasped the situation.

He didn't bother with the departing cultivators, focusing instead on the seven or eight demonic cultivators who were charging towards him with hostility.

Han Li's eyes flashed with cold light as he swept his sleeve, unleashing the thirty-six Qingtong Huiyun swords.

The swords transformed into hundreds of golden sword lights, each one flashing with golden lightning and emitting a deafening roar. The swords descended upon the demonic cultivators, ready to strike.

The seven or eight demonic cultivators, who were all cultivating yin-attribute techniques, were caught off guard by the Qingtong Huiyun swords' thunder laws, which countered their own magical energy. They were shocked and struggled to defend themselves.

As the demonic cultivators focused on the sword lights, Han Li's eyes turned cold, and he formed a hand seal. The True Word Treasure Wheel appeared behind him, spinning rapidly as it released a massive golden aura that enveloped the surrounding area.

The seven or eight demonic cultivators were caught off guard, and their bodies were instantly frozen in place, unable to move.

The next moment, the hundreds of golden sword lights descended, slashing across the demonic cultivators' bodies.

Han Li then swept his hand, and the True Word Treasure Wheel and the golden aura vanished.

The seven or eight demonic cultivators' bodies exploded, turning into a shower of blood and flesh. Their nascent souls and divine consciousness were unable to escape, and they were annihilated by the sword energy.

Han Li's sequence of attacks was extremely fast, and the True Word Treasure Wheel appeared and disappeared in the blink of an eye. Most of the onlookers didn't even have time to react before the seven or eight Taiyi realm demonic cultivators were defeated and killed.
This scene fell into the eyes of the nearby demon tribe, causing a huge commotion. The actions of those holding their hands stopped, and many people's eyes showed deep fear.

Lei Yu and others saw this situation and were also shocked.

But Han Li didn't pay attention to the surrounding people's gaze, and a golden lightning light flashed on his body, his figure disappeared instantly, and the next moment he appeared more than a thousand feet away.

He didn't say a word, and with a single hand, he pinched a spell, the True Speech Treasure Wheel reappeared, and golden ripples spread out, instantly covering the surrounding hundreds of feet, trapping the nearby demons.

As he swung his hand, hundreds of sword lights flew out again, and with a fierce twist, they turned the demon into minced meat.

Han Li killed more than a dozen Taiyi Realm demons in a row, and the demons on the scene looked at him with a hint of fear, fleeing in all directions.

Han Li's face didn't change, and a golden lightning light flashed on his body, and he was about to use his Lightning Escape Technique to chase after them.

At this moment, a series of thunderous roars sounded, and a large piece of black lightning bolts moved in the air, a black lightning spirit domain appeared out of thin air, and it covered everything.

Inside the black spirit domain, a tall, sturdy man with a long beard stood upright, his eyes cold as ice.

Xiong Shan was currently being blocked by several Taiyi Realm demons in the distance, and he was fighting with them.

He had just obtained a treasure and was excited, so he continuously stimulated the Great Wilderness Ancient Sword to display its powerful divine abilities, and his internal energy was depleted by more than half, almost to the point of exhaustion. Now, he could only use some methods that didn't consume his energy to fight against the Taiyi Realm demons, and he couldn't stop the long-bearded man.

Han Li was covered by the black lightning spirit domain, and the golden lightning light on his body was like ice and snow meeting fire, instantly melting and disappearing. His face slightly changed.

Not only was the golden lightning light on his body extinguished, but the lightning power on the Qingtong Huanyu Sword revolving around him also dimmed several times, leaving only a faint glow.

"You little one, I don't care who you are outside, but today you won't leave here alive!" The long-bearded man's face was ferocious, and after covering Han Li with the spirit domain, he immediately roared, his hand holding a black long knife that slashed through the air.

Instantly, 150 lightning law crystals flew out from the black long knife, entwining each other.

The black lightning flashed, and those lightning law crystals turned into a black five-clawed lightning dragon, a terrifying aura burst forth from the dragon's body, surpassing the previous black lightning lion.

The five-clawed lightning dragon moved its body, and its body transformed into a black lightning bolt that shot out, instantly flying to Han Li's head. The dragon's claws changed into a strange shape, and it fiercely grabbed downwards.

The sky darkened, and it seemed that the entire sky was also crushed by the lightning dragon's claws, causing the heavens to collapse.

The long-bearded man seemed to have used a divine ability similar to reversing the truth wheel, and this series of actions was incredibly fast. Han Li had just noticed being covered by the black lightning spirit domain, and the next moment, the five-clawed lightning dragon's claws arrived in front of him.

He was shocked, and he only had time to raise his fist to punch the air.

A "boom" sound echoed, and a golden fist shadow appeared out of thin air, dragging a long golden tail light, and it collided with the black dragon's claws.

The fist shadow contained a powerful force, and wherever it passed, the air was crushed, and cracks appeared.

The Qingtong Huanyu Swords beside him also flew out with the fist shadow, and they instantly formed a large blue sword lotus, with countless sword shadows moving in it, blocking in front of him.

The five-clawed lightning dragon let out a dragon roar, and the black lightning on its claws surged, fiercely grabbing the golden fist shadow.

A "rip" sound echoed!

The golden fist shadow, which seemed to have substance, was easily torn apart by the five-clawed lightning dragon's claws like paper.

The black dragon's claws didn't stop, and they grabbed the blue sword lotus again.

The Qingtong Huanyu Swords were Han Li's lifebound treasures, and although they were suppressed by the spirit domain, the lightning law was not fully displayed, but the sword lotus was extremely powerful, far surpassing the fist shadow.

The black dragon's claws grabbed the blue sword lotus, and a shocking sound echoed. The blue sword lotus flashed twice, and then it was also broken through, exploding and scattering the 36 Qingtong Huanyu Swords.

The black dragon's claws paused for a moment, and then they fiercely grabbed Han Li again.

Han Li saw this, and his pupils shrank.

He sought this momentary gap, and his body's golden light surged, a golden spirit domain appeared, and it quickly spread around him, instantly submerging the five-clawed lightning dragon. At the same time, the True Speech Treasure Wheel appeared behind him, rotating rapidly.

In an instant, countless golden ripples appeared, also covering the five-clawed lightning dragon.

Not only that, but the True Speech Treasure Wheel's side also flashed with golden light, and the Dantian Fire appeared, instantly opening the Dantian Fire Boundary, which also covered the lightning dragon.

The five-clawed lightning dragon was frozen in place, unable to move, by Han Li's time spirit domain, the True Speech Treasure Wheel, and the Dantian Fire Boundary.
