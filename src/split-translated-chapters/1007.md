Here is the translated text:

"I am the leader of the Qing Huo tribe, but my mother has been ill recently and has been in seclusion to recover, so she cannot come to greet you. Please forgive her," Ye Su Su said with a hint of apology, noticing that Han Li seemed to be in a daze.

"It's no trouble, we should pay our respects to the master anyway. Since she's in seclusion, we won't disturb her. The scenery in Qing Huo City is quite unique, could you show us around?" Han Li replied.

"Of course," Ye Su Su agreed, dismissing her attendants and leading Han Li and Ti Huo to explore the city.

Qing Huo City was vast, covering several thousand miles, with a generally flat terrain, but also several rivers and low mountains. The city was surrounded by lush forests, making it a beautiful sight.

As they walked, the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the city.

Ye Su Su led Han Li and Ti Huo to the center of the city, where a grand palace stood.

The palace was enormous, covering an area of about 200-300 acres, and was made of wood, exuding a sense of grandeur and precision.

In front of the palace stood a massive statue of a blue fox, carved from a single piece of jade, its body towering over 100 feet tall, with nine long tails stretching behind it.

"This is the Tian Huo Palace, where my ancestors used to reside and hold meetings," Ye Su Su explained.

"Tian Huo Palace? Your tribe is called Qing Huo, why isn't it called Qing Huo Palace?" Han Li asked, his curiosity piqued.

"I'm not sure, it's just what our ancestors decided," Ye Su Su replied, shaking her head.

Han Li nodded thoughtfully, not pursuing the matter further.

"There are several quiet courtyards next to the palace, used to receive honored guests. It's getting late, so I'll let you rest here tonight, and I'll come visit you again tomorrow," Ye Su Su said, leading them to a nearby courtyard.

"Thank you," Han Li said, as Ye Su Su summoned two attendants to guard the courtyard before leaving.

Han Li watched Ye Su Su disappear into the distance, his eyes narrowing slightly before turning to Ti Huo and entering the courtyard.

The courtyard was paved with blue bricks, with a small garden to the left and a cluster of bamboo to the right. The night breeze rustled the flowers and bamboo, filling the air with a subtle fragrance.

Han Li nodded in approval, taking a seat in the main hall and falling into thought.

"Master, are you planning to stay in Qing Huo City for a while?" Ti Huo asked, approaching Han Li.

"How did you come to that conclusion?" Han Li asked, his brow raised in inquiry.

"If not for that, with your usual style, you would have just saved Ye Su Su and left. You wouldn't have used up your energy to help her cultivate, and you wouldn't have come here with her. And earlier, you asked Ye Su Su to show us around, wasn't that to gather information about the city?" Ti Huo asked, her eyes sparkling with mischief.

"Qing Huo City is a small and unassuming tribe in the Jin Yuan Mountains, and it's located in a remote area, making it a good place to hide. I've been exploring the city, and I haven't found any dangers," Han Li said, his eyes scanning the surroundings.

"That's great, but how can we stay here? The Qing Huo tribe seems to be quite hostile towards outsiders. Of course, if you show off your strength, it would be easy to stay, but that would defeat the purpose," Ti Huo said, her face lighting up with excitement before furrowing her brow.

As they had walked through the city earlier, they had noticed the hostile gazes of the Qing Huo tribe members towards them.

"Don't worry, I have a plan," Han Li said, his eyes glinting with amusement as he gazed towards the east side of the city.

...

Later that night, under the soft moonlight, a figure emerged from the city, flying towards the east side of the city.

The figure landed in front of a dense forest, revealing Ye Su Su, dressed in a majestic blue palace gown, her hair adorned with a jade crown.

In front of her stood a small, dilapidated statue of a blue fox, only half the size of the one in the palace. Ye Su Su's face was solemn as she bowed to the statue, then drew a drop of blood from her finger and dripped it onto the statue.

The statue's eyes suddenly lit up with a bright, pulsing blue light, which disappeared into the void.

The forest began to tremble, and a series of ripples appeared on the surface of the air.

Ye Su Su's palm also glowed with a bright blue light, which she extended towards the void, and then pulled back.

A tearing sound echoed through the air as a gap appeared in the void, revealing a dark and mysterious space.

Ye Su Su's eyes scanned the surroundings, ensuring that no one was watching, before she stepped into the void and disappeared.
At this moment, a faint shadowy figure floated out, and before the void's crack could close, it flashed in.

Ye Susu only felt a blur in front of her eyes, and a large basin-like depression, dozens of miles in size, appeared before her.

The basin was mostly empty, with large tracts of spiritual fields opened up, and it seemed that many spiritual herbs and medicines were planted within.

However, the spiritual fields were surrounded by restrictive light screens, blocking the view of the inside, and waves of intense medicinal fragrance wafted out from the screens, making one's spirit quiver.

Ye Susu didn't pay attention to the spiritual fields and flew straight forward.

Behind her, the void flashed, and the shadowy figure reappeared, with Han Li's face emerging, looking around at the spiritual fields with a surprised expression.

Han Li was extremely familiar with various spiritual herbs and medicines, and just by smelling the fragrance, he knew that the herbs and medicines planted inside were extraordinary, comparable to his own medicine garden, and his heart couldn't help but be shocked.

To know that the medicine garden had taken him a great deal of effort to establish, and with the help of the Heaven's Palm Bottle, it had reached its current scale, and the Qing Huo clan's strength wasn't particularly powerful, yet they were able to cultivate a medicine garden comparable to his.

He moved his body and flew towards the spiritual fields below.

...

Ye Susu flew forward, quickly arriving at the depths of the basin.

A large, emerald-green pool of water appeared on the ground, with gentle waves and soft, rippling light.

Next to the pool were several large, blue-green stones, and she lightly tapped on one of them.

The stone suddenly sank downwards, revealing a dark cave entrance, and a long staircase leading deep into the earth.

Ye Susu stepped into the cave, quickly reaching the end.

A large, stone chamber appeared before her, with the ceiling inlaid with several fist-sized, white pearls, illuminating the space with a milky white light, and the walls flashing with starlight, making it look quite beautiful, with obvious restrictive spells cast upon it.

 Inside the chamber, a white, jade bed was placed, and a woman in a blue dress lay on it, her lower body encased in a massive, blue ice mountain.

The ice mountain emitted a bone-chilling cold air, and the entire chamber was extremely cold, with faint, icy wisps floating in the air, as if they too were frozen.

The woman's face was deathly pale, her teeth clenched tightly, and her eyebrows furrowed, clearly enduring immense pain and suffering.

A string of sweat droplets the size of beans fell from her forehead, and as soon as they landed, they froze into ice beads.

A woman in a white dress stood beside the bed, her hands pressed on the woman's shoulders, and her hands emitted a bright, blue light, continuously flowing into the woman's body.

The woman in the white dress had an immense aura, clearly a Gold Immortal of the initial stage.

"Master, you've returned," the woman said, looking up at Ye Susu, her face slightly surprised, and she stopped her hand, bowing.

The woman on the bed also opened her eyes, looking at Ye Susu.

"Susu, you've returned," the woman said, her lips moving, revealing a difficult smile, and her eyes filled with tender emotions.

"Mother!" Ye Susu quickly walked to the bed, grasping the woman's hand, and her eyes suddenly turned red.

"Good child, Mother... is fine, it's just that the cold air has been invading more severely lately, but with Elder Qiu's help, I can withstand it. But you, you've gone out again, and this time you've been gone for so long, what have you encountered? Have you met any dangers?" the woman said gently.

"Child, I went to Jin Xi City, and traded some things with them, and on the way back, I met a few people from the Jin Ma Sect, it was a bit perilous, but fortunately, I met two seniors who helped me..." Ye Susu concealed most of the truth, simply recounting her journey.

To avoid her mother noticing anything unusual, she explained the matters of Han Li and Qi Huo in detail.

"What! Master, you actually invited a human cultivator into the Qing Huo City! The others in the clan don't know, but do you not know that the clan leader's current state is precisely because of those human cultivators?" the woman in the white dress said, her face immediately turning cold, and she scolded.

"Elder Qiu, the ones who harmed Mother are indeed human cultivators, but we can't just hate all human cultivators because of this. The Jin Yuan Immortal Realm is currently under human control, and the Qing Huo clan wants to develop, so we must interact with them. As the leaders of the Qing Huo clan, we must put aside personal grudges and consider the interests of the clan." Ye Susu's eyes flashed with hatred, but she quickly suppressed it, and sighed.

In the shadows of the corridor outside the hall, a blurry figure stood silently, which was Han Li.

He heard Ye Susu's words and a hint of admiration flashed in his eyes.

The woman in the white dress heard Ye Susu's words, her eyebrows furrowed, and she was about to say something, but was interrupted by the woman in the blue dress:

"Elder Qiu, let's do as Susu said, those two seniors have Gold Immortal-level strength, if we befriend them, it will be greatly beneficial to the Qing Huo clan's future development. My past injuries, you don't need to worry about them."

"Since the clan leader and Master have said so, then let's do it," the woman in the white dress said quietly.

"Thank you, Mother!" Ye Susu's face lit up with joy.
