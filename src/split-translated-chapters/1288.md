Han Li said, "Master, you don't need to worry too much. With the recent movements in the Wheel of Rebirth and the invasion of the Gray Realm, the entire Immortal Realm is in a state of turmoil. For now, the Heavenly Court shouldn't be able to pay attention to me."

Mi Luo Old Ancestor's expression turned serious, saying, "The Wheel of Rebirth is not a concern, but the Gray Realm is nothing in the eyes of the ancient ones. The Heavenly Court's foundation is incredibly deep, and you probably don't know just how deep it is. If the ancient ones notice your threat, with your current cultivation level, it will be difficult for you to protect yourself. You must quickly break through your cultivation, and if you can become a late-stage Mahayana cultivator, you will have the ability to deal with the Heavenly Court."

Han Li's face flashed with hesitation, and he said, "Master, it's only been a short time since I first severed my mortal coil, and my mid-stage Mahayana cultivation level has only just stabilized. I still need a lot of time to sever my mortal coil again, and there are still many immortal apertures that haven't been connected."

"You are different from ordinary cultivators, as you cultivate both the body and the law. With your body's immortal apertures nearly fully connected, as long as you have enough time and law artifacts, as well as a large amount of immortal stones, opening the Time and Space Heavenly Array won't be a problem. You're truly worried about something else, aren't you?" Mi Luo Old Ancestor slowly said.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he said, "Master, you see right through me. To be honest, the last time I severed my mortal coil, it wasn't because of my diligent cultivation. I was forced to use a Severing Mortal Coil Symbol, and I had to take a risk and sever my mortal coil. If I'm too hasty now, I'm afraid I'll be too reckless, and it will be like trying to help a seedling grow by pulling on it. If my cultivation foundation isn't solid, won't I end up losing everything?"

Mi Luo Old Ancestor chuckled, saying, "You're worrying too much. Severing one's mortal coil is also a matter of fate, and it's not just a matter of having all the immortal apertures connected. Otherwise, the people of the Immortal Realm wouldn't have spent so many resources to create Severing Mortal Coil Symbols. Of course, because there are many unexpected situations when severing one's mortal coil, the higher one's cultivation level and the more prepared one is, the greater the chance of success. I'm just telling you to quickly lay a solid foundation, and when the time is right, you'll be able to sever your mortal coil quickly. Once you reach the late-stage Mahayana cultivation level, as long as the Dao Ancestor doesn't personally intervene, none of the Dao Ancestor's subordinates will be able to do anything to you."

Han Li nodded, saying, "I understand now, Master."

Mi Luo Old Ancestor said, "Before that, first complete your Five Elements Illusory Realm and raise your spiritual domain to the true Heavenly Man Realm, making it compatible with the great array. Your cultivation speed will also increase greatly."

Han Li's face revealed a look of difficulty, and he said, "This... I was previously disturbed by external events and haven't found the opportunity to complete the Five Elements Illusory Realm. This matter will have to be put off for a while."

Mi Luo Old Ancestor smiled and asked, "Have you forgotten why I had you come to this Yan Luo's Manor?"

Han Li suddenly slapped his forehead, and a look of sudden understanding appeared on his face.

In the past, Mi Luo Old Ancestor had given him three time law artifacts and a golden jade book, but after his physical body had returned, they had all disappeared.

At that time, the Old Ancestor had said that if those things couldn't be brought back through the physical body, he should come to the Yan Luo's Manor to find them.

As he thought about it, Mi Luo Old Ancestor waved his hand, and a brilliant golden light appeared before Han Li. A cyan-colored ancient tree, a broken blue long spear, a yellowish-brown stone, and the golden jade book all appeared.

In addition to these, there were two storage rings and a golden jade slip suspended in the air.

Mi Luo Old Ancestor said, "The storage rings contain some immortal stones and time law artifacts of varying quality, but they should be enough to assist your cultivation. As for the 'Immortal Golden Cloud' cultivation method jade slip, you had previously stolen it from the Cang Gong Pavilion, but you weren't able to bring it with you. I've kept it for you."

Han Li's heart was moved, and he deeply bowed to Mi Luo Old Ancestor.

Mi Luo Old Ancestor smiled and received the bow, saying, "Alright, time is limited. First, thoroughly refine your Five Elements Illusory Realm. I'll help you protect your path one last time."

Han Li bowed respectfully and received the items.

After examining them, Han Li discovered that the cyan-colored ancient tree, the broken blue long spear, and the yellowish-brown stone were all high-quality time law artifacts, each with a different attribute corresponding to the five elements. They were exactly what Mi Luo Old Ancestor had prepared for him to refine his Five Elements Illusory Realm.

However, the Dong Yi divine tree had already merged with the Two Life Tree, so the cyan-colored ancient tree couldn't be used. The blue long spear and the yellowish-brown stone, on the other hand, could be combined with the Time and Space Heavenly Array.

Han Li put away the other items and sat down cross-legged under the jujube tree. He formed a hand seal, and the five elements illusory realm around him began to change.

The tree shadows shook and contracted, eventually merging into a single tree. The true form of the round moon appeared, suspended behind Han Li.

The countless flowing flames in the sky converged, forming a golden flame torch that fell before Han Li.

Only the winding Time River and the undulating mountain range remained in their illusory state, appearing before Han Li.

Han Li raised his hand, and the blue long spear and the yellowish-brown stone flew up, falling into the mountain range.

The long spear entered the water, splashing up water droplets, while the stone entered the mountain, causing the earth to shake.

Han Li's time law energy surged out, and he rapidly formed hand seals, striking the mountain range with them.

In an instant, the river's waves surged, and the mountain's peaks shook, as a thick golden light enveloped the entire space.
Milo Laozu saw the scene and his eyes were filled with a look of satisfaction. He walked slowly to the door of the thatched hut, leaned against the wall, and sat down with his legs crossed.

His hands were clasped together in front of him, and suddenly, he made a slight movement, drawing two semi-circles in the air. The two semi-circles rotated to the left and right, then merged in front of him, and his palms suddenly shone with a brilliant golden light. The light transformed into a series of golden ripples, filling the entire space.

Han Li basked in the golden light, feeling an indescribable sense of comfort and relaxation. His heart, which had been fluctuating earlier, suddenly calmed down.

The water-blue long spear, which had been immersed in the River of Time, gradually lit up with a soft glow. Eventually, it dissipated and merged into the river, causing the river to transform from gold to blue. The surface of the river began to ripple with waves.

The mountain range below, which had been dependent on the river, began to tremble. The earth-yellow stone that had fallen to the ground took root, merging with the mountain range.

The mountain range, which had been insubstantial, finally gained a true foundation and became solid. The True Speech Treasure Wheel and the Broken Time Fire simultaneously flew back into the sky, transforming into a round moon and stars. The Two Life Trees fell onto the mountain range, their roots connecting with the mountain, and instantly turned the mountain green.

As a powerful wave of time law fluctuations spread out, the Five Elements Fantasy World was finally refined and merged with Han Li's Time Spirit Domain, achieving the highest state of unity between heaven and man.

Han Li's heart was filled with joy, and he was about to recall his divine abilities when he heard Milo Laozu's voice in his mind:

"Although your innate talent in the path of time law is not as good as mine, your circumstances are better. I am also looking forward to seeing how far you can go. Unfortunately, my time is running out..."

"Master..." Han Li replied.

"As your master, I have taught you very little about time law. Now, I can only protect you for a while longer. You must cherish this gift and not waste it..." Milo Laozu's voice gradually became more ethereal.

Han Li looked at him and saw that he still wore his usual benevolent smile, but his face was becoming increasingly blurry. His body was emitting countless golden starlights, dispersing into the surrounding spiritual domain.

"Master..." Han Li called out.

In the next instant, the entire secret realm shook, and a gigantic, intricate array rose from the ground, operating on its own without Han Li's control.

Han Li looked around, shocked to discover that the array was the "River of Time Heavenly Array".

Milo Laozu was telling him to close up in this place, using the power of the array to quickly enhance his cultivation.

The River of Time Array merged with Han Li's Heavenly Spirit Domain, and the array's power suddenly changed, creating a time-space with a previously unseen time difference.

Han Li's mind moved, and he immediately began to frantically operate the "Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique".

A loud, piercing sound echoed through the air as a golden light vortex descended from the sky, engulfing Han Li. Countless, extremely pure time law forces surged towards him from all directions, pouring into his body.

"Ah..."

Han Li let out a loud cry, his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth simultaneously emitting golden light. Every pore on his body was penetrated by the time law forces.

"Boom, boom, boom..."

A series of explosive sounds echoed within Han Li's body. He had only recently broken through the Mirror of the Soul, and now his body was once again being penetrated by the time law forces.

One, two, three...

Han Li couldn't even feel joy at this moment. The brutal and direct infusion of time law forces was something that even a true late-stage Great Luo cultivator might not be able to withstand.

He was only able to maintain a semblance of rationality because his spiritual orifices were almost fully open, and his physical body had reached its peak. Moreover, the power of the time law forces was infused with Milo Laozu's own time law forces, making it more compatible with Han Li's body.

Even so, the pain and suffering Han Li endured at this moment were unimaginable.
