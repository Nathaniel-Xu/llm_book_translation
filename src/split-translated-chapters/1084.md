Lei Yu Ce and the others saw Han Li being trapped by She Yan, hesitated for a moment, and then flew towards him.

"Serves you right!"

Jin Liu's mouth curled up into a smile, and he muttered a sentence, also flying towards Han Li.

Only Xiang San and the other person didn't move immediately, seemingly hesitant.

"Earlier, you seemed to want to help him, could it be that you're also from the same sect as him? If so, don't hold back, you can try to rescue him, who knows, maybe you can save him?" She Yan saw this and looked at Xiang San with a hint of provocation.

Xiang San's eyes flashed with anger, and his fist clenched, taking a step forward.

"Good, it's indeed his accomplice, you..."

She Yan's words were cut off as her expression suddenly changed, and an anomaly appeared at her feet.

A golden light flowed from the clay figurine that was binding Han Li, and a strange, golden tree shadow suddenly appeared, rapidly growing and spreading its branches. Thick, golden vines extended from it, wrapping around the entire figurine.

A strong, golden light burst forth, and a dense, temporal law force flowed out.

In the midst of the chaos, the clay figurine that was binding Han Li suddenly melted, turning into a puddle of yellow mud. Han Li's figure leapt up, his Qingtian Bianyun sword stabbing straight at She Yan.

This all seemed to happen in an instant, but in reality, it was just a brief moment under the influence of the temporal law.

She Yan was shocked and tried to retreat, but her feet felt heavy, and she looked down to see a layer of golden sand particles covering her feet up to her ankles.

She felt a strange, temporal law fluctuation coming from beneath her, and her legs felt as if they were frozen in place, unable to move.

Before she could react, the golden vines from the tree shadow wrapped around her upper body, binding her in place.

At the same time, a brilliant light burst forth from behind Han Li, and the Zhenyan Baolun appeared, completely sealing She Yan in place.

Han Li didn't hesitate, his wrist flicking, and his Qingtian Bianyun sword flashed with electricity, stabbing straight at She Yan's chest.

This scene unfolded too suddenly, and the people nearby were affected by the temporal law force, unable to move.

Han Li's sword tip stabbed into She Yan's chest, producing a sound like metal striking stone, and a burst of golden sparks. However, the Qingtian Bianyun sword couldn't pierce through her chest!

Han Li's brow furrowed, seemingly surprised.

At that moment, a series of yellow talismans on She Yan's body lit up, and a wave of earth-attribute law force burst forth, forming a layer of yellow, earthy law force fluctuations that collided with the temporal law force emanating from Han Li's three law force manifestations.

The temporal law force, being one of the three supreme laws, naturally held the upper hand. However, Han Li and She Yan's cultivation realms were still different, and She Yan's earth-attribute law force was quite profound, allowing the two to clash.

A layer of golden light was pushed back by the yellow, earthy light, and She Yan's body was enveloped in a yellow, earthy glow, as if a small, self-contained world had formed around her, gradually restoring some of her mobility.

Han Li's brow furrowed deeper, and he quickly withdrew the range of his three law force manifestations, strengthening his control over She Yan.

Earlier, due to his underestimation, She Yan had fallen into his carefully laid trap, and now he had her under his control. If she were to escape now, it would be difficult for him to capture her again.

As expected, with the three law force manifestations' power being concentrated, the small, self-contained world around She Yan was compressed, and her body was once again frozen in place, unable to move.

Han Li's heart was slightly at ease, and with a flick of his wrist, thirty-six Qingtian Bianyun swords appeared, hovering in mid-air and vibrating with an intense, blue glow.

The swords' vibrations created a sea of blue, sword-like shadows, and a low, rumbling sound, like thunder, echoed through the air.

"Quickly!"

Han Li's voice was low and urgent.

The golden, electric light burst forth, and a golden, dragon-like sword energy appeared, producing a sound like a dragon's roar, and a massive, golden sword energy descended from the sky, aiming straight for She Yan.

The golden sword energy's passage caused the air to distort, and the space around it seemed to tear apart, creating a massive, quake-like shockwave that shook the entire desert.

Just as the golden sword energy was about to engulf She Yan, a strange, blue light suddenly appeared from behind Han Li.

A blue, crystal-like orb, about the size of a fist, appeared, and several golden talismans on its surface lit up, releasing a massive, blue, watery glow that exploded into a gigantic, swirling vortex.

Han Li was caught off guard, focused as he was on controlling the temporal law force manifestations and manipulating the Qingtian Bianyun sword to kill She Yan. He didn't notice the sudden change behind him until it was too late.

He felt a massive, overwhelming power sweeping towards him, despite the golden light from the Zhenyan Baolun attempting to block it. The temporal law force manifestations and the Qingtian Bianyun sword were both unable to be controlled.
With a loud boom, Han Li was sent flying outwards.

The sword dragon formed by Qing Zhu's Bee Cloud Sword scattered in an instant, losing all its momentum, and the sword light dissipated, leaving only the physical flying sword, which flew back into Han Li's body through their spiritual connection.

Han Li flew back hundreds of meters before stabilizing his body, and he turned to look at Lei Yuze and the others, his eyes filled with anger.

The others also looked at one of their own, Jing Liu, with surprise.

It was Jing Liu who had attacked Han Li with the Hunyuan Ming Water Pearl, causing him to fail in his attack.

"Why..." Su Xi asked, her eyes filled with doubt.

"Why? This person is a wanted criminal of the Heavenly Court, shouldn't we all be allowed to kill him? You're not willing to help Shi Qian, and you're not even a true cultivator of the Jin Yuan Sect. You're asking me why?" Jing Liu's expression turned stern, and he spoke with righteous indignation.

"You acted impulsively, aren't you afraid of bringing trouble to our Tian Shui Sect? The Heavenly Court is not to be trifled with, and you've already offended the Wheel of Rebirth," Su Xi said, her voice laced with anger.

"Su Xi, are you intentionally trying to protect the wanted criminal? If that's the case, then I..." Jing Liu's words were cut off by Shi Qian.

"Hehe, Jing Daoist, there's no need to say so much. According to our previous agreement, if you help me capture Han Li, I'll help you take down Su Xi. What's difficult about that?" Shi Qian smiled, his eyes gleaming with malice.

Jing Liu's expression changed, and his face showed a hint of embarrassment.

"Let's focus on capturing Han Li first," he said, quickly regaining his composure.

Jing Liu knew that Shi Qian's words were meant to bind him to her, and he felt a strong sense of resentment, but he didn't dare show it.

At this moment, not only Su Xi, but also Lanyuanzi and the others, looked at Jing Liu with disdain, and Lei Yuze's eyes even held a hint of killing intent.

The Hunyuan Ming Water Pearl had seemed powerful, but in reality, it had only disrupted Han Li's attack and helped Shi Qian escape, without causing much damage to Han Li himself.

Han Li suppressed his anger, and with a grip of the Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword, which was formed from 36 swords, he suddenly charged towards Shi Qian.

Shi Qian's eyes also showed a hint of seriousness, and he no longer dared to underestimate Han Li.

He turned his wrist, and the yellow light around him expanded, forming a spiritual domain that enveloped the surroundings.

The ground began to change, and mountains and mud pits appeared.

Han Li's body had just flown out hundreds of meters when the ground began to erupt, and giant hands made of mud shot out to grab him, while a mountain peak crashed down on him.

The space around him was becoming increasingly heavy, and his speed was slowing down.

"Brother Han, I'll help you," Jiao San's voice came from the ground, and a dark red spiritual domain opened up.

Han Li felt the pressure around him decrease, and he was about to thank Jiao San when Fox San's spiritual domain also opened up.

"Ah, I couldn't just stand by and do nothing..." Fox San sighed.

Han Li's heart was filled with joy, and he activated his Tian Sha Zhen Yin Gong and True Spirit Bloodline, causing his body to be surrounded by a blood-red glow. His body expanded, and he transformed into a giant demon with three True Spirit heads.

"See, they're indeed allies of the Wheel of Rebirth. Why aren't you all attacking them?" Shi Qian said, his voice filled with surprise.

Lei Yuze and the others didn't move, and Lanyuanzi and his sister turned their backs on the scene.

"Are you trying to rebel?"

Shi Qian's face turned red with anger, but he was helpless, and he could only charge towards Han Li.

His wrist turned, and a wolf-toothed club appeared in his hand, emitting earth-attribute law energy. It was a high-grade immortal artifact.

The two enemies were separated by hundreds of meters, and they both unleashed their full strength, striking each other.

At this moment, Han Li's star power had reached its peak, and his True Dragon, Kunpeng, and Mountain Giant Ape powers were all unleashed. The Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword's devilish energy was also activated, and a giant lightning sword descended from the sky.

Shi Qian's wolf-toothed club was surrounded by a yellow glow, and a layer of black, rocky energy appeared on its surface, containing a terrifying amount of condensed gravity. The club's weight was unimaginable, and it was like a giant mountain peak crashing down on Han Li.
