Master's intuition has always been quite accurate. It seems I also need to hurry up and close up for a period of time, not to mention improving my cultivation, at the very least to recover the spiritual energy I've lost before. Ti Hou's expression changed slightly upon hearing Han Li's words, and he immediately spoke up.

Han Li didn't say anything else, and immediately began setting up the area around the small courtyard. He took out several sets of restrictive flags and arranged them around the courtyard, then set up a few more layers of restrictions in the rooms where he and Ti Hou would be staying. Once he was certain that everything was secure, he stopped.

The two of them then began their closed-door meditation. Han Li entered the secret room in his quarters, sat down in the lotus position, and closed his eyes. He sat quietly for half a day, until his mind and spirit were completely calm, then took out a silver-colored pill furnace.

With a wave of his sleeve, a blue light flew out from his sleeve and swept across the floor, causing various spiritual materials to appear on the ground. These materials were all ingredients for the Heaven's Blue Pill.

Han Li spat out a mouthful of silver-colored flames, which landed on the pill furnace, and the furnace quickly heated up. He took out one of the materials and put it into the furnace, and began to refine the pill.

...

At the same time, in the great hall of the Qing Huo clan, Ye Luo, Qiu Long, and Ye Su Su were gathered together.

"Clan leader, do you really intend to let that human cultivator stay in our clan and live among us? I think this is unwise, his background is unclear, and he's a human cultivator, after all. Most of our clan members harbor deep resentment towards human cultivators, and if we let him stay in the city, it will inevitably lead to discontent among our people." Qiu Long frowned and spoke in a serious tone.

"Qiu Long, don't worry, Han Li is planning to stay in our clan to cultivate in seclusion, and he won't be going out and about. He's also asked us to keep his presence a secret, so we'll just announce that he's left Qing Huo City. This matter will only be known to the higher-ups, that's all." Ye Luo shook his head and said.

"But he's a human cultivator, after all, and his nature is difficult to predict. His cultivation is quite high, and leaving him in our clan is a hidden danger." Qiu Long still looked somewhat unconvinced.

"But he's helped us so much, and now he's just asking to stay and cultivate. If we don't agree, we'll be too petty." Ye Luo waved his hand and said.

"Qiu Long, I think Han Li and Ti Hou are not bad people, and Han Li's strength is quite formidable. Our Qing Huo clan has been facing many crises in recent years, and who knows, maybe one day we'll need to rely on his power." Ye Su Su also spoke up.

"Since the clan leader and the young master both think this way, then let's let him stay. But his identity is unclear, so let's arrange for some people to secretly monitor him, just in case." Qiu Long fell silent for a moment, then reluctantly agreed.

"Alright, then let's leave this matter to Qiu Long. But Han Li is skilled in the art of investigation, so when you arrange for people to monitor him, be careful not to let him discover it." Ye Luo thought for a moment, then nodded and said.

"Clan leader, don't worry." Qiu Long replied, then quickly left.

...

Three years later.

In Han Li's secret room, he made a hand seal and pointed at the silver-colored pill furnace. The furnace's lid emitted a flash of light, and it flew up into the air, hovering in mid-air.

Han Li made another hand seal, and five blue-colored pills flew out of the furnace and landed in a jade bottle. Each pill was the size of a dragon's eye, and was a deep blue color, like the sky. They emitted a faint, ethereal fragrance.

He had already filled dozens of jade bottles with pills, and each bottle was filled with a fragrant aroma that could be smelled through the walls.

Han Li looked at the jade bottles surrounding him, a satisfied smile on his face.

This Heaven's Blue Pill was the first time he had refined a pill of the Tai Yi level, and at first, it had been very difficult. But with the help of the True Speech Treasure Wheel's divine abilities and his previous experience in refining pills, his success rate had quickly improved.

Han Li waved his hand, and the pill furnace and the refined flames all disappeared. He then took out a jade bottle, poured out a Heaven's Blue Pill, and swallowed it. He circulated his cultivation method, and a dazzling golden light erupted from his body, illuminating the secret room and turning everything golden.

...

The years passed, and the closed-door meditation continued. Before he knew it, over a hundred years had passed.

In the Jin Yuan Immortal Palace, a magnificent golden palace, a middle-aged man dressed in a white silk robe sat on the golden dragon throne, his temples slightly gray, his eyes deep and profound, as if he had already seen through the ages. This was the master of the Jin Yuan Immortal Palace, Dong Fang Bai.
At this moment, his eyes were deep and profound, slowly scanning the person standing below, although his face showed no anger, it still made his heart tremble, and he didn't dare to breathe.

The person below, not tall, but slender and handsome, was a young man dressed in colorful and elegant clothes, looking around fourteen or fifteen years old, but his eyes seemed like a dry and ancient well, exuding a faint aura.

"Tao Longzhang, I found this body for you to possess, not for you to enjoy idly, why have you not found even a hint of Han Li's whereabouts after over a hundred years?" Dongfang Bai slowly opened his mouth, asking.

"Palace Master, Han Li has been hiding his tracks since he escaped from Tian Song Guan, seemingly aware that we would search for him, and has not appeared in any major cities in the Xian domain, so it's likely that he is hiding in some remote and secluded place, making it difficult to find him." The young man replied, his expression tightening.

This young man was naturally Tao Ji, who had possessed another body to reincarnate, and had not fully merged with his new body, still getting used to his new voice, which was clear and bright, unlike his original middle-aged voice.

Seeing Dongfang Bai's face sink, Tao Ji became even more anxious and hurriedly explained:

"He has not appeared in any major cities, so it's impossible to use the long-distance transmission arrays, but it's clear that he has not left the Jin Yuan Xian domain, if you give me a little more time, I will definitely find him."

Dongfang Bai heard this and his eyes narrowed slightly, just about to speak, when his expression suddenly changed, and he said: "He's back..."

Not long after, someone outside the hall shouted, asking to enter.

When Dongfang Bai shouted "Enter!", the hall doors were slowly pushed open, and a thin, gray-haired old man and a black-robed, giant of a man with a ghostly head war knife, walked in side by side.

"Greetings, Palace Master." The two men stopped beside Tao Ji, bowed, and said.

"No need for formalities, what about the investigation?" Dongfang Bai waved his hand, asking.

The black-robed giant, Hei Dao, and the gray-haired old man, exchanged a glance, and the old man nodded, indicating for Hei Dao to speak first.

Hei Dao didn't hesitate, and began to speak:

"Reporting to the Palace Master, I was sent to investigate the situation at Tian Song Guan, and found that the battle scars left behind had been deliberately destroyed, and the residual law fluctuations in the void had been completely cleared."

"So, you also have nothing to show for it?" Dongfang Bai's eyebrows furrowed, asking.

"The battle scars were completely cleared, but the residual souls of the Xian Palace cultivators who died that day were not completely erased, I used ghostly secret techniques to collect some of the souls, and from their fragmented memories, I saw part of the battle scene. From that, I can tell that the person's cultivation was extremely deep, with over nine hundred Xuan Qi apertures opened, and his physical body was almost comparable to that of a Da Luo cultivator." Hei Dao shook his head.

"Over nine hundred Xuan Qi apertures... no wonder the two-yin-yang array, activated by ninety Golden Immortals, had no effect on him..." Tao Ji heard this, and his shoulders relaxed, muttering to himself.

"That day, Tao Longzhang, you personally fought against him, and didn't even notice that? You thought he could be easily defeated, how laughable!" Dongfang Bai's face finally showed some anger, asking.

"This... is my fault..." Tao Ji heard this, and was momentarily speechless.

At first, he had underestimated Han Li, and didn't pay much attention to his physical abilities, and when his spells didn't work, he was busy fleeing, and didn't notice much.

"This is not surprising, Tao Longzhang, the person's appearance and movements were all concealed, and in the chaos, it's hard to see clearly. I was able to see the truth through the souls of the dead because of my ghostly secret techniques." Hei Dao's expression remained unchanged.

"Is there anything else?" Dongfang Bai clearly didn't intend to pursue the matter further, asking.

"This person's body has at least three types of true spirit bloodlines, namely, the mountain giant ape, the true dragon, and the sky-traversing Kunpeng, which is why he has unmatched physical strength, and can control the yin-yang array, killing those who activated it. This kind of physical strength is comparable to that of a Da Luo cultivator." Hei Dao continued.

"If that's the case, I remember that when I was being pursued, I sensed a hint of Lei Peng's power from his body, which should also be a true spirit bloodline." Tao Ji suddenly remembered something, and hastily added.

"This is indeed strange, a human cultivator with four true spirit bloodlines, all of which are top-tier, how did he manage to avoid being counterattacked by the bloodlines?" Dongfang Bai's eyebrows furrowed, asking.

The gray-haired old man, who had been listening to Hei Dao's account, had his eyes spinning around, his hands holding a dozen or so jade slips, which he was flipping through, as if searching for something.

"This person has also cultivated time magic, and can condense it into a golden wheel, which can bind anyone it touches, making them feel like their thoughts are slowing down." Tao Ji added.

"True spirit bloodlines, Da Luo cultivation, supreme laws, and Tai Yi cultivation... can you imagine all of these being combined in one person? It's unbelievable! If such a person existed, they would have long since become famous in the Xian domain, so how could they be so low-key, and their tracks so difficult to find... are you sure you didn't make a mistake?" Dongfang Bai's expression was filled with doubt, asking.

Although it was possible that the person had made rapid progress in a short time, it was impossible for them to be so powerful, to combine these four attributes in one body.

"Palace Master..."

At this time, the gray-haired old man, who had been silent, suddenly spoke up.

"Lu Yun Longzhang, do you have any insights?" Dongfang Bai looked at him, asking.

"I don't have any insights, but I have found some interesting things in my travels, Palace Master might find them useful in understanding this person." The gray-haired old man bowed, and said.

He then handed over seven or eight jade slips, which he had selected, with both hands, respectfully presenting them.
