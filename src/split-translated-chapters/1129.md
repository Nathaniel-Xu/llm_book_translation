The last golden rainbow shot out with incredible speed, instantly piercing the golden flames and merging with them.

"Boom!"

A massive force of time laws burst forth from the golden flames, merging with the golden rainbow.

In the dark energy, the golden residual soul's body suddenly brightened, rapidly solidifying once more. At the same time, it raised a fist and struck out.

Rumbling sounds echoed through the air!

A multitude of golden flames, each several thousand feet long, shot out from the golden residual soul's fist, numbering over a hundred. They flew in all directions, emitting an aura of relentless destruction, capable of annihilating all things.

If one were to say what the most terrifying thing in the world was, it would be the unrelenting passage of time, which would ultimately lead to the downfall of all living things, including those who had transcended the bounds of time.

The over a hundred golden lights swept through the area, effortlessly tearing apart the nearby dark energy and the nine black giant palms, and then shot towards the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor.

The surrounding space was instantly enveloped by a massive force of time, rendering everything immobile, including the spatial rifts and the chaotic void energy within.

Even Han Li and the others, who had retreated to a safe distance, were caught in the time force, frozen in place and unable to move.

A series of complex changes occurred in an instant.

"Ten Directions Time Dao! Good! Good! Good! I didn't expect that even a residual soul like yours could unleash such a divine technique!" The Black Heaven Demon Ancestor's eyes lit up, and he burst into laughter.

As he laughed, his body radiated an intense black energy, causing the surrounding area to darken, devoid of any light.

At the same time, a black sword materialized in his hand, surrounded by a layer of black energy that seemed to shift and change, giving off an unpredictable and illusory aura.

"Lend me a sword, Heaven and Earth will weep!" The Black Heaven Demon Ancestor swung his arm, and the sword's shadow danced, unleashing over a hundred black sword shadows that resembled dragons.

The sword shadows emitted a cacophony of eerie and mournful sounds, causing those who heard them to tremble with fear and lose their minds.

The hundred sword shadows struck the golden rivers, creating massive shockwaves that shattered the surrounding space, creating large rifts.

The sound of the explosion echoed through the air!

The sword shadows and the golden rivers clashed, each unable to overpower the other.

The two massive forces of law collided, shattering the time force that had immobilized the surrounding space. Han Li and the others were instantly freed.

"Quickly, let's leave! The clash between these two peak-level existences is too intense, and we might get caught in the crossfire!" Liu Ziyu waved his hand, releasing a gray-white light that enveloped Huo San and shot towards the distance.

Han Li gazed at the golden rivers, sensing the time law aura emanating from them, and compared it to his own "Great Five Elements Illusory Realm Technique". The more he thought about it, the more he felt that it was profound and mysterious.

However, this was not the time to ponder the laws. He took one last look at the Time God Lamp, which was also radiating golden light, and then turned away, his body transforming into a golden rainbow as he shot towards the distance.

Huo San, Li Qimeng, and Qu Lin also quickly used their divine techniques to leave the area.

At this moment, the golden residual soul's hands formed a seal, and its body radiated an intense golden light, increasing its power by over tenfold.

The Black Heaven Demon Ancestor's eyes widened in surprise, realizing that the golden residual soul was willing to pay any price to increase its power.

Just as he was about to react, the golden rivers suddenly brightened, and a brilliant golden light shot out, destroying the black sword shadows and continuing towards the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor.

The Black Heaven Demon Ancestor's eyebrows twitched, but he remained calm, his body rapidly flashing around the area as he swung his black sword in all directions.

The black sword shadows flew out, forming a massive black lotus flower that easily resisted the golden rivers' attack.

The golden residual soul seemed unfazed, continuing to form seals with its hands.

A loud explosion echoed through the air!

The residual soul's body suddenly burst open, transforming into a blindingly bright golden light that engulfed the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor and the surrounding space, creating a golden world.

"You..." The Black Heaven Demon Ancestor's face changed for the first time.

But before he could react, the golden light suddenly reversed direction, forming a massive golden sphere that hovered in the air, several thousand miles in diameter.

The surrounding space was instantly restored to calm, and all the golden and black lights disappeared, leaving an eerie silence.
Is this the Spirit Realm? Han Li flew away and sensed the situation behind him, turning his head back to look, his face filled with surprise.

On this golden planet, he indeed felt the aura of the Spirit Realm.

"This is a Spirit Realm of the Heavenly Person realm! It has transformed from the void to the real, its power far surpassing that of the Refining Spirit realm and the Creating Spirit realm! I didn't think that this remnant soul could actually deploy it! Not good, he's going to self-destruct the Spirit Realm and perish together with the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor! We must leave quickly!" Li Qi said, standing beside Han Li, but before he could finish speaking, his face suddenly changed and he let out a loud roar.

As soon as Li Qi finished speaking, his body flashed with white light, and with a "poof" sound, a large amount of white cloud energy erupted, enveloping Han Li and Jiao San.

At the same time, white cloud energy also appeared on Li Qi's four hooves, and with a sudden movement, his body transformed into a white phantom, its speed increasing several times as it shot towards the distance.

Qu Xian's and Liu Zixin's faces also changed, as if they had discovered something, and their bodies burst out with light.

Qu Xian's body rolled and suddenly transformed into a golden rainbow over a hundred meters long, breaking through the air and flying towards the distance. In the golden light, a giant golden insect with spread wings could be seen.

The golden rainbow's speed was incredibly fast, and in an instant, it reached the edge of the horizon and then disappeared without a trace.

Liu Zixin opened his mouth and spat out a ball of gray-white light, which transformed into a gray-white light door over a meter tall. The light door had many silver patterns on it, emitting a powerful spatial energy.

He took Fox San and stepped into the light door, and their bodies instantly disappeared without a trace. The gray-white light door also flashed and disappeared.

As soon as the three of them disappeared, a brilliant golden light suddenly appeared on the golden planet in the distance, making it impossible to look directly at it. The planet's surface also had numerous flame-like patterns.

Moreover, a powerful aura that could destroy the heavens and the earth emerged from the golden planet, and before it could even explode, the surrounding void began to violently tremble.

A deafening explosion shook the heavens and the earth!

The golden planet burst open, transforming into a massive golden light halo that expanded rapidly towards the surroundings, its power so great that it could shatter the void. The space fragments and the surrounding void's chaotic flow were all engulfed by the golden light halo.

Inside the golden light halo, countless golden lights surged and formed massive whirlpools, seemingly capable of crushing and devouring everything.

The collapsed giant peak below was also affected, its fragments melting and being engulfed by the golden light halo, unable to resist its power.

The golden light halo expanded rapidly, causing the entire seventh layer of space to violently shake and tremble, with massive spatial cracks appearing everywhere, on the verge of collapse.

Han Li and the others had already flown a considerable distance, but their speed was still slower than the golden light halo's expansion. They were soon caught up.

Li Qi let out a strange cry, and his body's white light surged again. Two enormous white wings appeared on his back, with countless white cloud patterns flashing on them.

His speed increased several times, surpassing the golden light halo's expansion speed.

However, the entire seventh layer of space was beginning to collapse, and spatial cracks were continuously appearing in front of them, forcing Li Qi to constantly dodge and weave, affecting his progress and causing the two to maintain a similar speed.

The surroundings were chaotic, and Qu Xian and Liu Zixin's whereabouts were unknown.

"This won't do, Li Qi, I'll use my spatial transmission technique to escape to the sixth layer!" Han Li flipped himself onto Li Qi's back, his hands forming a seal.

A burst of golden lightning erupted from his body, expanding and forming a lightning array that enveloped the three of them.

He chanted a spell, and the lightning array rapidly rotated, with more lightning patterns appearing on its surface.

Because this time, he was transmitting three people, including Li Qi, a great demon, which required more effort.

Li Qi flew away with all his might, glancing at the lightning array around him, feeling the clever combination of lightning and spatial energy, and his eyes lit up.

A brilliant golden lightning flashed by, and the lightning array finally took shape. At this moment, the golden light halo was still behind them, not having caught up.

Han Li's face lit up with joy, and he was about to activate the lightning array to transmit.

But just as he was about to do so, the surrounding space emitted a deafening explosion, completely collapsing.

Han Li's body sank, and in an instant, he fell into the endless void's chaotic flow.

The void's chaotic flow surged forward, mixed with massive space fragments, easily tearing apart the lightning array.

The lightning array was only a transmission array, without any defensive power.

Han Li was swept away by the void's chaotic flow and flew off Li Qi's back, being pulled into the endless void's chaotic flow.

Li Qi and Jiao San were also swept away by the flow, their bodies disappearing without a trace.

Han Li felt a sensation of weightlessness, with the void's chaotic flow constantly surging forward, his ears filled with the sound of thunder, and his mind racing.

The void's chaotic flow in this place was extremely powerful, and even with his current strength, he could only barely maintain his balance, and because the space had completely shattered, there were many massive space fragments in the void's chaotic flow.
