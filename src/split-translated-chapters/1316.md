A burly old man was surrounded by several bandits wielding long weapons, and had no time to defend himself against the arrows flying towards him. It seemed he would soon be buried under the hail of arrows.

Just at that moment, a fan-shaped burst of golden lightning descended from the sky, sweeping across the arrows.

A loud crashing sound erupted, and the arrows made of fine steel exploded into fragments, turning into wisps of smoke, as soon as they came into contact with the golden lightning.

The golden lightning then split into hundreds of smaller lightning bolts, striking the bandits with precision, not missing a single one.

A deafening thunderclap shook the air!

The bandits were all blown away, and as they fell to the ground, they convulsed violently, crying out in agony, but none of them died.

The burly old man was not struck by the lightning, and stood there, staring at the scene before him, his eyes wide with incredulity.

The golden lightning quickly dissipated, and the bandits, who had been lying on the ground, struggled to get up, their faces filled with fear, as they looked around.

"Scram! If I see you robbing people again, I'll show no mercy!" a stern voice boomed from the sky.

The bandits, who had just gotten up, were shocked and frightened, and quickly scrambled to their feet, before fleeing in terror.

The burly old man glared at the fleeing bandits, but did not pursue them.

He was already old, and had suffered serious injuries, and was too weak to give chase.

A figure appeared in the air, and a man and a woman materialized, Han Li and Zi Ling.

"Immortal..." the burly old man looked at the two of them, his face filled with excitement.

"I saw that you have a noble bearing, and should not meet your end here. Since we met, I decided to help you." Han Li looked at the burly old man, and pointed.

A blue light shot out, and entered the old man's body.

The old man felt a surge of energy, and his fatigue disappeared, as his wounds healed at an incredible rate, and he felt a mix of shock and joy.

"Thank you, immortals, for saving me. I am eternally grateful!" the old man bowed deeply to Han Li and Zi Ling.

As the old man thanked them, a strange energy descended upon Han Li.

He made a hand gesture, and a flash of lightning illuminated the area, and when the old man stood up, the two of them had vanished.

...

A large lake in the Flying Wing Immortal Realm, a large ship sailed across its surface.

But at this moment, the lake's surface was churning, and a number of dark, black tentacles emerged from the depths, wrapping tightly around the ship, as if to crush it.

Fortunately, the ship was made of exceptionally sturdy materials, and although it creaked and groaned, it did not show any signs of breaking.

The ship's cabin was filled with several dozen people, who looked like tourists, huddled together in fear.

The lake's surface churned violently, and a massive, black beast emerged, resembling a giant, mutant octopus, its mouth open wide, as it lunged at the ship.

The people on the ship saw this, and let out a chorus of screams.

A loud thunderclap shook the air, and a bolt of golden lightning struck the beast, hitting it squarely.

The beast's neck was torn open, and its body was covered in electrical arcs, as it let out a terrified screech, and released its grip on the ship.

The beast's massive body sank beneath the surface, and disappeared.

The people on the ship were overjoyed, and thanked the immortals for their rescue.

Han Li and Zi Ling appeared in the air, Han Li's hand still crackling with golden lightning.

"Immortals, you saved us! Please, come out and accept our gratitude!" someone on the ship shouted, and rushed out to kowtow to Han Li and Zi Ling.

The others followed, and also rushed out to pay their respects.

Han Li smiled, and his body glowed with golden lightning, before disappearing once more.

...

The Northern Road State's Great Qing Mountain Range had been experiencing torrential rains for months, causing landslides, and a small village was on the verge of being destroyed by the mudslides.

A blue light suddenly descended from the sky, and the collapsing mountain was encased in ice, including the mudslides, and the village below was safe.

The villagers, who had narrowly escaped disaster, were overjoyed, but also confused, and did not know what had happened.

Han Li and Zi Ling appeared in the air.

"Immortals, you have descended! You saved us..."

Han Li had been traveling the Flying Wing Immortal Realm, helping those in need, and had been doing so for 20-30 years.

He had saved countless people, and his reputation had spread throughout the realm, and some people had even built temples in his honor.

His appearance had been described by those who had seen him, and had been carved into statues, which were worshipped in temples.

The Flying Wing Immortal Realm's various immortal sects had also heard rumors of the immortal who had been helping people, and had sent people to investigate.

Han Li did not want to get entangled with the immortal sects, and took Zi Ling with him, as they quietly left the realm, and traveled to a nearby realm.
Beyond the Winding Realm, in the vast expanse of the Savage Wilderness, a flying boat hurtled forward, with Han Li sitting cross-legged, his eyes closed as if sensing something.

After a long time, he opened his eyes.

"Brother Han, how's the progress on sensing the Benevolent Corpse?" Zi Ling asked, sitting beside him, noticing Han Li's awakening.

"It's fine, I can barely sense the existence of the Benevolent Corpse now," Han Li replied, his tone devoid of much enthusiasm.

"Is there a problem?" Zi Ling asked, her voice gentle, as she sensed Han Li's emotions.

"There is indeed a problem. I've been traveling the world, doing good deeds, but the blessings I've received have been dwindling, especially in the past year. There's been almost no response," Han Li said, his brow furrowed.

"How could this be?" Zi Ling's expression changed.

"I'm not sure. But I've only just begun to sense the Benevolent Corpse, and I'm still far from reaching the stage of Slaying the Corpse. I must find a solution, or I'll stagnate again," Han Li said, his voice low.

Zi Ling nodded slowly, remaining silent.

"I've been thinking, perhaps it's because I've saved fewer people recently, and my karma isn't enough, causing the sensation of the Benevolent Corpse to stagnate," Han Li said.

"There's a possibility, but it could also be due to other reasons. Brother Han, what was the most rewarding experience you had when helping others?" Zi Ling asked, her eyes sparkling.

"The most rewarding experience? That would be the first time I saved the storyteller and his grandson. After that, the returns were never as great, and almost nonexistent," Han Li replied, after a moment of consideration.

"I remember you helped many people after that, with some instances saving far more than two. It seems it's not a matter of numbers," Zi Ling said, shaking her head.

"Indeed, what's the difference between the first time and the many times after?" Han Li asked, his eyes narrowing.

Zi Ling fell silent, and even her clever mind couldn't grasp the profound and obscure truth.

"Let's not think about it too much. We've already made progress, and it's not insignificant. Let's just wait and see what opportunities arise," Han Li said, after a long period of contemplation, still without a solution.

Zi Ling nodded, also ceasing to think about it.

Han Li snapped his fingers, and a golden light entered the flying boat.

The spirit patterns on the boat suddenly brightened tenfold, and its speed increased, as if the nearby void was about to be torn apart.

After flying for over a dozen days, the two finally arrived at a new realm.

This realm's spiritual energy was abnormally scarce, far inferior to the North Cold Realm, and almost comparable to the Spirit Realm.

"What a barren realm..." Han Li's divine sense expanded, and his brow furrowed.

This realm was small, not even half the size of the Flying Wing Realm. His divine sense could cover the entire realm.

The realm's terrain was scarred, with excavated mineral veins everywhere, as if it had been ravaged by a brutal force. The spiritual veins had been destroyed, leaving behind a desolate landscape.

The realm's population was sparse, with few cultivators and mortals, mostly concentrated in a few specific areas. The spiritual veins in those areas were less damaged, and the remaining spiritual energy was barely enough to sustain the cultivators.

"What's the name of this realm?" Han Li asked.

"This realm is called the He Gong Realm. It was once a realm with abundant spiritual energy, rich in mineral veins. However, the Heavenly Court sent people to excessively exploit the realm's spiritual veins, causing the destruction we see today," Zi Ling said, taking out a jade slip and inserting her divine sense.

"The Heavenly Court..." Han Li's brow furrowed, and he muttered to himself.

"Brother Han, do you plan to continue helping others in this realm? The population is sparse, and the efficiency might be low," Zi Ling asked.

"Let's observe for now. It's rare to see such a desolate realm in the True Immortal Realm," Han Li said, his eyes flashing with interest.

Zi Ling nodded silently, saying nothing.

Han Li snapped his fingers, and a golden light enveloped the two, forming a lightning array.

The golden light flashed, and the two vanished without a trace.

In the northwest of the He Gong Realm, there was a massive basin, surrounded by mountains, with a radius of several thousand miles.

In the center of the basin stood a massive city, almost filling the entire basin. The city was home to a mix of cultivators and mortals.

Although the city was large, it lacked a prosperous atmosphere. Many areas were abandoned, and the air was filled with a faint smell of rust. The streets were empty, and the few shops that remained were mostly deserted.

The entire city was shrouded in a heavy, depressing atmosphere, as if it was an old man waiting for death.

Outside the city, a flash of lightning illuminated the sky, and Han Li and Zi Ling appeared.

The sky was gray and murky, and no one noticed the lightning.

Han Li looked down at the city, a hint of a smile on his face.

"Let's go take a look," Han Li said, flying down.

Zi Ling followed closely behind, and the two landed on a street.

As the sun began to set, the city was plunged into darkness, with only a few scattered lights visible.

Han Li walked aimlessly, his eyes closed, as if sensing something.

Zi Ling found it strange but didn't ask any questions, silently following Han Li.
