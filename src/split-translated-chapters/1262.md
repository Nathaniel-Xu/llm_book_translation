A sharp, piercing sound echoed through the air!

A yellow sword light burst forth from the giant sword, transforming into two sword auras that shot upwards and downwards.

In the high sky, a deafening boom resounded, and the clouds were split in two by the ascending sword aura, surging outwards in all directions, leaving a gaping chasm in the middle that seemed to have cleaved the entire sky in two.

At the same time, the other sword aura pierced downwards, splitting the entire Jade Vase Peak in two, leaving a deep, bottomless chasm in its wake.

Han Li's figure landed at the bottom of the chasm, tumbling into the underground wine cellar.

The countless years' worth of immortal wine stored within the Ti Hu Mountain were shattered, releasing a rich, intoxicating aroma that wafted up from the depths of the earth, making the entire Jade Vase Peak resemble a shattered wine bottle.

Han Li lay amidst the broken wine jars, his body soaked in wine, his arms splayed out on the ground.

He struggled to sit up, feeling a sense of despair in his heart. With his current strength, he was no match for Yue Qing's power, and even if he wanted to escape, it was likely a futile effort.

He had just tried to contact the Bottle Spirit through his divine sense, but as before, he received no response.

Just then, a powerful, oppressive feeling emanated from the high sky, as a yellow glow enveloped the entire heavens.

Han Li, still in the depths of the chasm, looked up to see a massive yellow cloud vortex swirling above, with flashes of lightning illuminating its center and the sound of muffled thunder rumbling through the air.

Next, he waved his hand, and thirty-six green bamboo swords flew out, encircling him.

A thunderclap boomed from the high sky, as if the entire heavens had been shattered.

The yellow cloud vortex above suddenly split open, and a massive yellow light pillar burst forth, striking down towards Han Li.

Han Li gritted his teeth, his hands forming a sword seal, as the thirty-six green bamboo swords surrounding him emitted a loud "clang" sound, forming a protective barrier around him.

"Condense!"

As he spoke, the green bamboo swords shone brightly, releasing countless golden threads that coalesced into a massive golden dragon, charging upwards towards the high sky.

Han Li was enveloped by the golden dragon's body, surrounded by sword light and sword aura, as he collided with the yellow light pillar.

A series of deafening booms echoed through the air, as the yellow light pillar was dispersed by the golden dragon's impact, its light fading away.

Han Li's figure also rose upwards, bursting out of the chasm and back into the high sky.

He looked up to see Yue Qing standing on the clouds, his giant sword at the ready, gazing down at him with an expressionless face.

On the other side, Jintong had transformed into a giant golden beetle, but was trapped by Wu Nai's silver threads, unable to escape.

Meanwhile, Xiaobai, seemingly having adapted to his bloodline's power, was fighting with renewed ferocity, devouring the wind blades sent by Pofeng's immortal soldier and spitting them back out.

They seemed to be safe for the moment, but Han Li's situation was the most dire.

Yue Qing was a late-stage Da Luo cultivator, a being who had transcended the bounds of mortality, and with Han Li's current strength, he was no match for him.

Han Li's eyes hesitated for a moment, and he let out a silent sigh. Even if he could summon the Bottle Spirit to travel through time and space, he couldn't just abandon Jintong and Xiaobai.

Since escape was impossible, and evasion was futile, he had no choice but to fight to the death.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he snapped his fingers, unleashing a torrent of temporal energy from his body.

The surrounding void responded, and the shattered Jade Vase Peak suddenly transformed, as a lush, verdant mountain range materialized, with a winding river flowing through its center.

Yue Qing stood on the clouds, gazing at the scene before him, a hint of surprise flickering across his face.

"You've cultivated for a relatively short period, yet you've reached the early stages of Da Luo, and your spiritual domain has already attained a heavenly aura?" Yue Qing's brow furrowed, his voice tinged with curiosity.

It was no wonder he was surprised, as cultivating and refining one's spiritual domain were both time-consuming and laborious processes, and it was rare for someone to achieve such a feat, especially someone as young as Han Li.

Just then, a bright, silvery light emerged from the clouds behind Yue Qing, coalescing into a shining, crystalline orb that floated in mid-air.

The silver light emanating from the orb enveloped Yue Qing's entire body, and the air around him seemed to freeze, as if time itself had been halted.

Yue Qing's face turned pale, and he felt a sense of suffocation, as if the very air around him had ceased to flow.
Han Li's thoughts seemed to slow down as he realized his mistake. He quickly guarded his spiritual sense and secretly activated his cultivation technique, causing a yellowish-brown light to appear on his chest. His body's scales shone brightly, emitting a strong aura that clashed with the surrounding silver light.

Although he couldn't break free immediately, his thoughts were no longer hindered. Seizing the opportunity, Han Li formed a hand seal and tapped his foot, creating a massive sword energy that lifted him into the air. He faced off against Yue Qing from a distance.

As he hovered in mid-air, Han Li changed his hand seal again, causing a loud, resonant sound to echo through the air. The thirty-six bamboo swords surrounding him dispersed, forming a battle array around his body.

A burst of electrical energy erupted, and the swords pointed towards the sky, unleashing thirty-six massive golden lightning bolts that shot up towards the heavens. The lightning bolts merged with the cloud sea beneath Han Li, causing it to boil and churn like a cauldron.

The cloud sea's turmoil was accompanied by flashes of lightning, as if a dragon was stirring within. The air around Han Li transformed, with clouds gathering and swirling towards him, forming a massive golden lightning cloud that rivalled Yue Qing's yellow cloud.

Within the golden lightning cloud, two massive golden pillars emerged, surrounded by a half-hidden golden gate. Han Li stood outside the gate, bathed in golden lightning, his hands still holding the sword seal.

"Open!"

With a loud roar, Han Li's hands suddenly merged, and the golden gate behind him trembled, opening a small gap. A vast, boundless golden lightning sea was revealed, with golden light surging and fluctuating like waves.

Unlike the previous time, when the heavenly gate opened and a torrent of lightning poured out, this time only small, fist-sized golden lightning orbs emerged from the sea. They floated towards Han Li, entering his palms and disappearing.

As more lightning orbs entered his palms, Han Li's aura began to surge, and his brow furrowed in pain. Yue Qing, however, looked puzzled, recognizing Han Li's sword array but unsure of its true nature.

Suddenly, Yue Qing's eyes flashed with a strange sensation, and he let out a loud roar. His body's scales shimmered, and golden inscriptions appeared, charging towards the surrounding silver light and forcing it back.

Yue Qing then grasped his sword hilt, his movements slow due to the time law's influence. He took a step forward, assuming a bow-like stance as he faced Han Li.

The massive broadsword was dragged alongside him, its surface inscriptions glowing as seven mountain peak patterns emerged, surrounded by clouds and mist.

As Yue Qing's aura stabilized, the yellow cloud around him began to shrink, condensing into a massive, earthy-yellow cloud peak behind him. The atmosphere was tense, with both sides poised for a decisive blow.

Han Li's eyes flashed with golden light, his gaze cold and detached. Finally, he turned his clasped hands, and the suppressed golden lightning in his palms burst forth, forming a golden lightning sword that extended from his hands.

"Slash!"

Han Li's voice echoed through the air as he swung his arms, unleashing a powerful slash that tore through the void, striking towards Yue Qing.

Yue Qing responded by raising his massive sword, its surface inscriptions glowing as it challenged Han Li's attack. The air was filled with the sound of crashing mountains as the two attacks collided.

A series of massive, illusory mountain peaks materialized, each one shattering as it clashed with Han Li's golden lightning sword. The fifth peak was cleaved in two, while the sixth peak was only partially split. The seventh peak, however, successfully halted the golden lightning sword, causing it to shatter and dissipate.

The outcome of the battle hung in the balance, with both sides waiting for the next move.
