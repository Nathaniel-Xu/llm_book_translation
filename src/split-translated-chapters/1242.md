Han Li walked into the Thunder and Lightning Region, and with a wave of his hand, the air seemed to vibrate with an otherworldly energy.

Below, the thunderclouds seemed to come alive, as if a multitude of white dragons were writhing and twisting, gathering from all directions.

In his mind, the sound of thunder boomed and echoed, and the dark, foreboding clouds below lit up with a brilliant, snowy light.

In the instant that the thunder dragons converged, a massive, snow-white lightning bolt shot up from the clouds, piercing Han Li's mind like a sword.

Han Li, standing at the center of the thunderstorm, was struck directly by the lightning bolt, and let out a blood-curdling scream that lasted for dozens of breaths.

Tears of the Soul, who had been watching from the sidelines, widened her eyes in shock, and gazed towards the spot where the lightning bolt had struck, but all she saw was a blinding light that made it impossible to see Han Li's soul.

After a long wait, the thunderstorm finally began to subside, and the brilliant light began to fade, gradually shrinking back into the clouds.

As the light dimmed, Tears of the Soul saw that two figures had appeared on the clouds, and to her amazement, they were both Han Li, as if he had split into two.

The Han Li on the left was twisted in a grotesque grimace, his arms raised in triumph, while the Han Li on the right had a much more tranquil expression, with only a faint furrow between his brows.

"How can it be that they're the same person, yet so different?" Tears of the Soul wondered, her heart racing with worry.

The aura of the evil corpse's soul was clearly much stronger than Han Li's original soul.

"Ha ha... finally, I've broken free! Finally, I've broken free! Ha ha, you have no idea how painful it is to be trapped in the depths of your mind, like a monstrous creature at the bottom of a well. Today, I'll make you taste the same pain, being suppressed in the depths of your own mind, unable to express your true self!" The evil corpse's soul glared at Han Li's soul with malevolent intent, its voice rising to a near-hysterical pitch.

As the evil corpse's soul let out a deafening roar, the calm of the mind-space was shattered once again.

On the left side of the mind-space, the dark clouds suddenly turned a deep, bloody red, as if a wave of blood had swept through them.

On the right side, the clouds grew even darker, with flashes of lightning illuminating the sky.

"You're no longer of any use to me," the evil corpse's soul sneered. "Just hand over this mind-space to me, and be done with it."

With a sudden movement, the evil corpse's soul reached out and grasped at Han Li's soul, its entire being surging forward like a tidal wave.

Han Li's soul, of course, would not go quietly into the night, and countered with a burst of lightning from the clouds behind him.

The two souls clashed, their auras locked in a fierce struggle, each side trying to overpower the other.

But in the end, it was Han Li's soul that began to falter, the evil corpse's soul proving to be the stronger of the two.

Just as the evil corpse's soul was about to deliver the final blow, Tears of the Soul intervened, striking the evil corpse's soul from behind.

But to her surprise, the evil corpse's soul merely turned its head, its eyes blazing with malevolent intent.

"Ah, I've been waiting for you," it said, its voice dripping with malice.

Tears of the Soul's eyes widened in shock, and she tried to retreat, but it was too late. The evil corpse's soul had already begun to absorb her own soul, drawing it into its own being.

In a flash of insight, Tears of the Soul realized that she had only made things worse, and that if the evil corpse's soul succeeded in absorbing her soul, Han Li would be doomed.

Just then, a brilliant light illuminated the mind-space, and a massive, sword-like aura shot out, striking the evil corpse's soul with incredible force.

The evil corpse's soul let out a startled cry, and retreated in disarray, releasing Han Li's soul from its grasp.

But Han Li's soul, still reeling from the previous attack, was unable to avoid the sword-like aura, and was struck with incredible force.

The evil corpse's soul, still absorbing Tears of the Soul's soul, let out a triumphant cry.

"Ha ha... you see, Tears of the Soul, you're just a foolish mortal, blinded by your loyalty to this useless trash. What future can you possibly have with him?"

But Tears of the Soul merely smiled, a strange, enigmatic smile.

"My master's wisdom is beyond your comprehension," she said, her voice dripping with confidence.

And with that, she reached out and struck the evil corpse's soul with a blast of dark energy, encasing it in a sphere of crimson light.

The evil corpse's soul let out a roar of rage, its face twisting with fury.

"You think a mere barrier can hold me? I'll break free in an instant, and make you suffer for eternity!"

But Tears of the Soul merely smiled again, her eyes glinting with amusement.

"You won't need an instant. Ten breaths will be enough."

And with that, Han Li's voice echoed through the mind-space, his words dripping with confidence.
The evil corpse was temporarily sealed, and the control of the entire sea of consciousness returned to Han Li's divine soul. He sat down cross-legged and quickly calmed the anomalies in the sea of consciousness.

At the same time, in the underground space, Lan Yan was anxiously watching Han Li and Ti Hou.

Ti Hou's ears had two blood lines flowing through them, and Han Li's situation was even more dire, with dark blood flowing out of his seven orifices.

Just then, a faint cry suddenly came from Han Li's mouth, and his eyes suddenly opened.

Lan Yan saw his blood-red eyes and was shocked, exclaiming: "Han Daoist friend..."

Han Li ignored her call, flipped his palm, and a flash of crystal light appeared in his palm. A series of black crystal chains emerged, flying into his brow.

As he pressed his palm against his forehead, the black crystal chains flew out, entering his brow in a flash.

Han Li's eyes closed again, leaving Lan Yan confused.

At the same time, within his sea of consciousness, the wind and clouds suddenly changed, and the 36 black crystal chains transformed into crystal light chains that pierced the clouds, like black dragons, and rushed towards the evil corpse's divine soul, which was being sealed by Ti Hou.

"Isolation Lock Chain..." Seeing this, Ti Hou finally understood why Han Li had to separate from the evil corpse.

If the evil corpse's divine soul didn't separate, their divine souls would be intertwined, and Han Li wouldn't be able to contact Ti Hou separately, nor could he temporarily control his body to use the Isolation Lock Chain.

"A mere Isolation Lock Chain, thinking to seal me?" The evil corpse sneered.

However, its words were light, but its actions were fierce, and it transformed into a whirlwind that rushed towards Ti Hou.

Ti Hou, who was only a divine soul projection, was already struggling to hold on, and with this force, it was immediately dispersed, and the spherical light screen was also blown open.

"Seal it!" Han Li's voice boomed.

The 36 Isolation Lock Chains, which were already rushing towards the evil corpse, suddenly shone with golden light, and golden symbols appeared on the surface of the chains, radiating dazzling light.

"This is... Refining Divine Technique!" The evil corpse's eyes widened in shock.

It raised its hands, and a lightning barrier appeared in front of it.

However, the Isolation Lock Chains pierced through the barrier like it was nothing, entering the evil corpse's body, and then exiting, sealing the surrounding area.

"No, no..." The evil corpse's divine soul roared in anger, but it was too late.

It felt its power being sealed, and its voice gradually weakened.

Han Li's divine soul was exhausted, and he sat down, saying: "I had already fused the Isolation Lock Chain with the Refining Divine Technique, originally planning to use it as a secret technique against others. I didn't expect to use it on myself first."

...

In the underground space, Ti Hou sat pale-faced beside Han Li, meditating.

Lan Yan was like an ant on a hot pot, walking back and forth beside them.

"Ti Hou Daoist friend, it's been almost half an hour, why hasn't Han Daoist friend woken up?" She looked up at the sky, worried.

"Master's divine soul was severely injured, and it won't recover that quickly." Ti Hou opened his eyes, expressionless.

"This is a problem, the battle with the Ghost Spirit Saint earlier was quite intense, and this place must have been noticed. Even if the sect is currently in chaos, a high-ranking cultivator will soon arrive here. We can't stay here any longer." Lan Yan's face was filled with worry.

Ti Hou was about to speak when he heard a faint sound, and he quickly turned to see Han Li exhaling a long breath, his eyes fluttering open.

His eyes had lost their blood-red color, but seemed even deeper than before.

"Master..." Ti Hou quickly stood up, asking.

Han Li didn't respond immediately, only shaking his head.

"Han Daoist friend, congratulations on surviving this calamity, you will surely have good fortune in the future." Lan Yan also approached, speaking.

Han Li only nodded, expressionless.

"Master, how is it? Did you seal the evil corpse?" Ti Hou asked through divine sense.

"I temporarily sealed it, but this is only a temporary measure. I need to quickly increase my cultivation, open more divine orifices, or else I won't be able to succeed in slaying the corpse." Han Li shook his head, smiling wryly.

He didn't say everything, but the evil corpse had already separated its divine soul, and the longer it stayed in his sea of consciousness, the stronger it would become, making it even harder to slay the corpse.

"Although it's a temporary measure, we've at least gained some time." Ti Hou sighed in relief.

"Let's deal with the current situation first." Han Li took out a medicinal pill and swallowed it, not meditating or resting, but instead standing up and saying.
