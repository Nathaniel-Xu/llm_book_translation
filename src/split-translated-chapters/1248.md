"Jin Tong, do you know the way out?" Han Li asked, raising an eyebrow.

"That's right... I was once brought here by those people when I was imprisoned in the Ghost Valley, and I even met a gray-robed old man," Jin Tong said confidently.

"What gray-robed old man?" Han Li asked, slightly puzzled.

"I don't know, but in the Jiuyuan Temple, his seniority seems to be very high, and the Ghost Spirit Child has to bow and show respect when he sees him. However, the old man is not bad, and he is kind and gentle. He even instructed the Ghost Spirit Child to treat me well. But then, the old man suddenly closed up and didn't care about anything, and I never saw him again," Jin Tong said, seeming to have a good impression of the old man.

"Do you really know the way?" Han Li asked, half-believing and half-doubting.

"Hey, big brother, you don't believe me, who can you believe?" Jin Tong said with a pout, his face reddening.

Just then, Xiao Bai spoke up, "Boss, do you really know the way? Last time, I followed you, and you got us lost, and we were blocked by the Ghost Spirit Child. We couldn't escape. And before that, you led me..."

"What did you say?" Jin Tong's face turned red with anger, and he slapped Xiao Bai on the head, asking fiercely.

"Ah, nothing, nothing, I'll just listen to you, big brother..." Xiao Bai rubbed his head, speaking hastily.

"Since Blue Daoist doesn't know the way, let's follow Jin Tong. We'll move stealthily and avoid fighting with the Jiuyuan Temple disciples. Our priority is to escape quickly," Han Li said after a moment of thought.

"Don't worry, just follow me, and we'll definitely be fine," Jin Tong said with a smile, full of confidence.

After saying that, she looked around and raised her hand, pointing in a direction, "Come on, let's go this way!"

Han Li and the others followed Jin Tong, going around a fake mountain on the right and entering a dense forest.

Inside the Jiuyuan Temple, the buildings were not too many, and there were no grand high-rises, but the layout of the pavilions and corridors was very orderly, with connecting corridors and gardens in between.

Han Li and the others passed through three gardens, and along the way, they didn't encounter a single Jiuyuan Temple disciple.

When they exited the third garden, they saw a lake in front of them, with a vast expanse of water and a thick layer of mist.

Across the lake, although they couldn't see, they could hear the distant sounds of explosions and screams, and it seemed that a fierce battle was taking place.

Han Li looked up at the sky and saw a layer of golden light covering the clouds, shaking slightly with each explosion.

"What's wrong, Han Daoist?" Lan Yan asked, her expression tense.

"Did big brother take the wrong way?" Xiao Bai asked hastily.

"Want to die, is that it?" Jin Tong slapped Xiao Bai on the head, and he quickly lowered his head.

"The way is correct, the lake shore opposite can hear the sounds of battle, which means that the other side is the area where the Wheel of Reincarnation and the Jiuyuan Temple are fighting. We should be far from the center of the Jiuyuan Temple, so our direction is at least correct," Han Li said calmly.

"See, I told you I wouldn't get it wrong," Jin Tong said with a smile, looking pleased.

"But, master, what if the Wheel of Reincarnation is attacking too fiercely, and they've already reached the core area of the Jiuyuan Temple? We might be heading straight into the heart of the battle," Xiao Bai said suddenly.

"You're itching for a fight, and today you're arguing with me again," Jin Tong scowled, glaring at Xiao Bai.

Xiao Bai quickly apologized and rubbed his head.

"It's not possible, the Wheel of Reincarnation may have prepared well, but they can't attack so quickly. Moreover, the Jiuyuan Temple's defensive barrier hasn't been broken, and the area of battle shouldn't be the core position," Han Li said, shaking his head.

"Daoist Han is right, and the Jiuyuan Temple is the most important place in our temple. If it's really been breached, the commotion wouldn't be so small," Lan Yan said, nodding in agreement.

"Let's go, after we cross the lake, we'll find a place without fighting disciples and try to leave the temple's barrier. We can then use the Thunder Array to escape quickly," Han Li said.

The group then flew across the lake, their bodies glowing with a faint light as they moved swiftly and stealthily, almost touching the water's surface.

The lake's mist was so thick that it was like a high-grade Spirit Gathering Array, and the water droplets on its surface were actually tiny liquid pearls formed by the condensation of spiritual energy.

As Han Li and the others flew across the lake, they didn't need to use their powers to absorb the spiritual energy, and they could feel the gentle caress of the mist on their skin, like a warm bath.

Han Li's fatigue from the previous battles was even alleviated by the lake's mist, and he felt refreshed and rejuvenated.
Just as he was relaxing in the comfortable feeling, a familiar voice suddenly came from the fog in front of him:

"What are you people?"

As soon as the voice fell, a green figure suddenly flashed by in the fog in front of him.

Immediately, the fog in the surrounding void suddenly condensed, and a series of "cracking" sounds came out, and the entire lake was instantly covered with a layer of white frost, directly freezing into a thick layer of ice.

"Miao Fa Xian Zun..." Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and he said with a hint of helplessness.

In front of him, the frozen fog retreated to the sides, revealing a woman in a green dress, her face absolutely beautiful and flawless, but her chest was not particularly prominent, which was a bit of a pity.

Lan Yan's face turned pale as she saw the woman, and she quickly lowered her head, her expression becoming fearful and guilty.

Miao Fa Xian Zun's gaze swept over Han Li and the others, and her expression became more and more shocked.

"Han Li, you're really bold, daring to take my Jiu Yuan Guan disciple, trespassing into the Jiu Yuan Palace, and even releasing the Shi Jin Xian?" Miao Fa Xian Zun saw Lan Yan, and her gaze flickered slightly as she scolded Han Li.

Lan Yan's eyes flashed, and she was also a bit helpless, Miao Fa Xian Zun had actually mistaken her for being taken by Han Li.

"This Shi Jin Xian is my spirit pet, and today I borrowed the opportunity to come here and take back what belongs to me. Since my goal has been achieved, I don't want to stay in your Jiu Yuan Guan anymore. Miao Fa, you might as well make it convenient for us to leave, and you can also go deal with those guys from the Lun Hui Temple, it seems they're about to break through the seal." Han Li smiled and said.

Miao Fa Xian Zun heard this, and her expression became slightly serious as she glanced at the seal in the sky, which was shaking more and more frequently.

In the next instant, she suddenly attacked, striking out with her palm towards Han Li.

The void was filled with a chill, and Han Li's eyes flashed as he saw six familiar crystal lights appear around him, and something seemed to be covering him from above.

He activated the time law within his body, and his sleeves swept out, pulling Jin Tong and Lan Yan back as they retreated a hundred meters in an instant.

Just as they had retreated, a massive six-sided snowflake ice crystal covered the area where they had been standing, and six blue crystal lights flashed out from it, forming a familiar white crystal wall.

The six crystal lights had formed a six-sided crystal wall, but because Han Li had reacted in time, they fell in an empty space.

"Too fast..."

Miao Fa Xian Zun's expression changed, and she only now noticed that Han Li's aura was far beyond what it had been before.

"Same trick, I'm not going to fall for it again. Since we both have things to attend to, let's part ways for now." Han Li didn't want to fight her, and as soon as he finished speaking, he used the time law to its limit, and his figure blurred as he disappeared from the spot.

However, just like the first time he met Miao Fa Xian Zun, she had already used a circle of towering ice crystal walls to seal off the surrounding area.

So Han Li had only just flown out a hundred meters before he encountered an ice wall.

"Leave it to me..."

Jin Tong shouted, and he flew out first, bathing in golden light as if he had been drenched in a liquid, and directly collided with the ice wall.

A loud explosion shook the entire ice crystal wall, and a series of cracks spread out from the center, causing the wall to collapse.

Han Li and the others flew out from the ice crystal powder, heading in another direction.

"Don't think you can escape!" Miao Fa Xian Zun shouted, pursuing them.

Her feet floated on a massive six-sided snowflake ice crystal, which rapidly moved through the void, its speed extremely fast as it chased after Han Li.

Han Li had already opened up his time domain, controlling it within a range of ten meters around them, just enough to envelop them, and with the time law's power, he guaranteed their rapid movement.

"Why do we have to escape? Why don't we just kill her?" Jin Tong asked in confusion.

"A mid-stage Da Luo realm cultivator is not someone you can kill easily. If we get caught up in a fight, it will only cause more trouble." Han Li said.

"What do we do now? Being chased by her isn't a solution either." Jin Tong furrowed his brow, asking.

"First, let's shake her off, and then we'll think of something else. Prepare yourselves." Han Li's expression remained unchanged as he said.

Jin Tong and Xiao Bai nodded in unison, while Lan Yan looked puzzled, her eyes flashing with a hint of confusion.

In the next instant, a series of silver electric columns suddenly appeared around them, and a silver light array was formed, which flashed violently, and Han Li's figure disappeared from the spot.
