In a certain location of the Heavenly Court, a golden palace floated in mid-air. The palace was surrounded by countless streams of air that shattered everything around it, making the area look desolate and chaotic, as if it was the scene of the primordial chaos before the creation of the world.

The golden palace, despite its vibrant color, did not exude an air of luxury, but rather a sense of ancient simplicity, resembling a Taoist temple. The palace gates were tightly closed, and the sounds of murmuring voices could be heard coming from within, making the palace tremble and causing the surrounding air to become even more turbulent.

At this moment, the sounds from within the palace suddenly stopped, and the gates opened silently, revealing a narrow slit. A figure emerged from the slit, and it was Guo Huo Jin.

Through the slit, one could see that the interior of the palace was a vast, endless golden space, with no visible floor, resembling the outer realm of the Nine Heavens. The space was filled with floating orbs the size of houses, emitting various colors of light, like the twinkling of countless stars.

The gates quickly closed, isolating everything within. Guo Huo Jin raised his hand, and a xuanhuang-colored scroll flew out from his sleeve, with two small golden dragons coiled at each end, looking delicate and extraordinary, like a treasure beyond compare.

Guo Huo Jin pointed at the scroll, and the two golden dragons suddenly came to life, biting down on the scroll and unrolling it. The scroll displayed a list of names, each with different colors and auras, some shining brightly, while others were dull.

At this moment, one of the names near the front turned gray, and it was Xuan Yuan Jie.

"Someone has actually killed Xuan Yuan Jie," Guo Huo Jin muttered to himself, and his eyes suddenly turned golden, shooting out a golden light that illuminated the name on the scroll.

Countless strands of xuanhuang energy flowed down from the scroll, disappearing into the void, and the gray name suddenly expanded, as if opening a spatial channel, rapidly extending outward.

In an instant, a vast region appeared, filled with floating meteorites and chaotic elemental flows, which was the outer realm of the domain.

Han Li and Jin Tong sat cross-legged within the region.

"Bug Ancestor? Has he returned already? That's good, it saves me the trouble of searching for him. Hmm, who is this person?" Guo Huo Jin looked at Jin Tong, then turned to Han Li, and his eyes widened slightly.

Within the outer realm, Han Li's expression suddenly changed, and he stood up, looking around.

The next moment, he shouted, and his hands flashed with golden light, releasing ten golden sword shadows that shot out in all directions.

The speed of the golden sword shadows was impossible to describe, as if they could transcend time and space, disappearing instantly.

Han Li's right arm extended in another direction, and a golden light shot out from his palm, enveloping Jin Tong.

But just as this happened, the flow of time in the surrounding space suddenly became chaotic, and a massive golden palm appeared in the sky, pressing down on Han Li and Jin Tong.

A burst of temporal energy exploded from the palm, and time seemed to freeze, but Han Li's transmission was too swift, and he managed to activate it before the temporal energy took effect.

A flash of lightning illuminated the area, and the two figures disappeared.

The golden palm crashed down, and the space where Han Li and Jin Tong had stood was instantly shattered.

A massive wave of golden energy erupted, sweeping outward in all directions, without making a sound.

Everything within a radius of millions of miles was instantly reduced to dust, without a sound.

In the desert near the Dragon Abyss, a bolt of lightning appeared, and a golden lightning sword broke through the air.

The sword was followed by the appearance of Han Li and Jin Tong.

"That was the temporal giant palm technique that killed the Miro Master back then. It seems that the Time Ancestor has taken notice of us," Han Li said, his eyes narrowing, and he took a deep breath.

Although he had anticipated this day would come, he couldn't help but feel a sense of tension, mixed with a hint of excitement.

"What was that?" Jin Tong asked, his face pale with shock.

"That was Guo Huo Jin. It seems that we killed Xuan Yuan Jie, and now he's after us," Han Li replied calmly.

Jin Tong's face changed color upon hearing this.

In front of the golden palace, Guo Huo Jin's expression was one of surprise.

"Very fast... almost as fast as Shi Kong Yu's instant movement." Guo Huo Jin praised, but didn't stop, his eyes flashing with golden light.

The scene on the xuanhuang scroll changed rapidly, and Han Li and Jin Tong's figures reappeared.

Guo Huo Jin formed a hand seal and slapped the air, and the desert sky above Han Li and Jin Tong shook, as a massive golden palm appeared once more.

Han Li looked around, his hands flashing with golden light, and the air around him was filled with the sound of thunder.

He had deliberately erased his aura during the transmission, and the distance was extremely far, almost spanning an entire realm, so even the Time Ancestor's divine consciousness couldn't detect them.

But to be safe, he decided to transmit again.

Just as he did, the air above him shook, and a massive golden palm appeared, its five fingers curled into a fist, and it pressed down on Han Li and Jin Tong.
Golden light flashed like thunder, the massive palm descending with a speed that was noticeably faster than before.

"How can this be!" Han Li's eyes flickered with surprise, his hands immediately weaving a spell.

The two figures' bodies glowed with lightning, and along with the lightning sword on their heads, they vanished in an instant, narrowly avoiding the massive palm's slap.

In the Tianhe Xian Domain, near the Longyuan Xian Domain, a mountain range floated in the air, with a lightning sword hovering above it, spinning rapidly and emitting a series of sword hums.

Below the lightning sword, the air rippled, and Han Li and Jintong's figures appeared.

Han Li's face was grave, without a moment's hesitation, he activated the lightning sword transmission technique once again.

As they transmitted away, he swept his sleeve.

Over twenty green bamboo bee cloud swords shot out from his sleeve, disappearing into the nearby void.

At the edge of the Tianhe Xian Domain, the void flashed with lightning, and Han Li and Jintong's figures reappeared.

Han Li still didn't pause, once again activating the lightning sword transmission, and their figures vanished once more.

They transmitted over a dozen times, crossing multiple xian domains, until they arrived at a domain filled with rotting earth and miasma. Han Li finally stopped.

"Having transmitted so far, we should be safe now," Han Li thought to himself.

But as if mocking him, the sky flashed with golden light, and the golden massive palm descended once more, its speed far exceeding the previous two times, and emitting a deafening roar.

Han Li's face sank, immediately preparing to activate the lightning sword transmission once more.

"Hmm," a sound echoed, as countless golden lights seeped out from the surrounding void, transforming the surrounding void into a solid, unshakeable gold.

Han Li's connection to the lightning sword and the other swords was instantly severed.

Han Li's face finally changed color, but he didn't panic, his hands swiftly weaving a spell, conjuring numerous finger silhouettes.

A tidal wave of golden light surged out from his body, mixed with countless golden talismans, instantly forming a massive golden spirit domain.

The five treasures of the time laws – the True Speech Treasure Wheel, the Light Purification Bottle, the Mirage Sand Hourglass, the Dongyi Divine Tree, and the Time Severing Fire Torch – appeared within the golden light, surrounding his body and revolving rapidly.

Everything within the spirit domain became solid, forming a miniature world.

Han Li fully activated the time laws, barely completing everything before the golden massive palm descended.

The golden massive palm struck down, releasing countless golden ripples, and everything around it froze.

Only Han Li's spirit domain remained unaffected, the five treasures of the time laws rapidly rotating, the golden spirit domain growing even deeper, as if it were another world.

A deafening crash echoed through the air!

The golden massive palm heavily struck the golden spirit domain, causing it to violently shudder, and it was smashed down from the sky, crashing into the earth.

The land below cracked open, releasing massive fissures, and a large amount of magma erupted from the ground, causing the entire continent to collapse.

However, the spirit domain's miniature world appeared with massive fissures, but it stubbornly refused to collapse.

Han Li was also struck down along with the spirit domain, his body stumbling, and a mouthful of blood had already been spat out.

"His spirit domain withstood the Heavenly Emperor's Great Hand Seal, how unexpected," Guo or Jin's face flashed with surprise in the Heavenly Court.

He immediately weaved a spell, striking the air.

A golden, ancient clock-shaped pattern appeared on the palm's center, and it suddenly brightened, causing the massive palm to expand several times, tightly grasping Han Li's spirit domain, and squeezing it with all its might, as if trying to crush it.

The golden spirit domain creaked and groaned, the golden light flashing wildly, and the fissures within it rapidly expanded.

Han Li, despite spitting blood, seemed unharmed, but upon seeing this, he hastily activated the spirit domain with all his might.

A deafening crash echoed, as a massive golden heavenly gate appeared within the spirit domain.

In his previous battles with Feng Qing and Chen Ruyan, Han Li had been extremely cautious, but he had still accumulated a great deal of killing karma. This time, he didn't dare to open the heavenly gate, which connected to the various planes, and borrow the power of time.

As he thought this, a mysterious, unseen force transmitted to him, and the incantation of the "Great Five Elements Fantasy Realm Technique" flowed through his mind, clearer than ever before.

Han Li's heart flashed with understanding, and he weaved a spell.

The heavenly gate's surface rippled, and five golden lights appeared, each representing the five elements – metal, wood, water, fire, and earth – which were the five time laws of the "Great Five Elements Fantasy Realm Technique".

A muffled sound echoed, as the heavenly gate burst open.

A massive amount of golden light, containing the power of the Dao, surged out from the heavenly gate, pouring into the spirit domain.

This time, the power of the Dao that flowed out from the heavenly gate was even greater than before.

The fissures within the spirit domain immediately stopped, and no longer expanded.

Han Li's heart was filled with joy, and he waved his hands, causing the five golden lights to shoot out from the spirit domain, forming a massive, golden, auspicious cloud that covered the sky – the Undying Golden Cloud.

A gentle cry echoed from the side, as Jintong transformed into his true form, the Devouring Golden Immortal, and spat out a mouthful of golden light.

Tens of thousands of golden lights converged, forming a massive, golden light pillar that struck the golden massive palm.

Han Li and Jintong joined forces, and managed to resist the golden massive palm.

The golden light within the spirit domain no longer fluctuated, and it returned to calm, and as the heavenly gate's golden light poured in, the fissures within the spirit domain rapidly healed.
