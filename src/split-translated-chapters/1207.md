Jiao San smiled and said, "You and I belong to the Wheel of Rebirth Hall, and Han Li is someone I introduced to you, so it's only natural that I would do these things. By the way, Han Li, after you arrive at Jiuyuan City, you can go to the Fengyun Guest House in the outer city district. That's a place where our hall has secretly set up a presence, so you can feel safe staying there."

However, Han Li just flipped the mask in his hand and didn't say anything for a moment.

"Han Li, is there anything you're not clear about?" Jiao San asked, slightly taken aback.

"Han Li understands what Jiao San just said, but now that it's come to this, shouldn't Jiao San tell me some details about this mission?" Han Li looked at Jiao San deeply and asked.

In the past, Han Li's cultivation was still at the Taiyi Realm, and his cultivation was weak, so he didn't dare to ask too many questions about the Wheel of Rebirth Hall's mission. He was afraid of getting too deeply involved in the struggle between the Wheel of Rebirth Hall and the Heavenly Court.

But now that his cultivation had greatly improved, his attitude towards things was completely different. He was no longer timid and hesitant.

"Han Li, it's not that I don't trust you, but I really don't know much about the details of this mission. Even if I wanted to tell you, I wouldn't know where to start," Jiao San said with a sigh, her face apologetic.

"Jiao San, let's not use such evasive language. We've known each other for a long time, and I think you're not an ordinary person within the Wheel of Rebirth Hall. You must know something about this mission. Since we're going to cooperate, it's better to be honest with each other," Han Li said with a smile, his fingers moving slightly as he flipped the mask in his hand.

"I'm not evading, I really don't know. This mission is very important, and it's being personally overseen by a high-ranking person within the hall. I'm just a small liaison officer, so I wouldn't know the details," Jiao San said with a bitter smile.

Han Li saw that Jiao San's attitude didn't seem fake, so he thought to himself, "Tixi, is this person telling the truth?"

"Tixi, this person is just a virtual projection, and I can't sense any changes in their spiritual aura. But judging from Jiao San's expression, it doesn't seem like she's lying," Tixi's voice echoed in Han Li's mind.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed slightly as he listened to Tixi's words.

"Although I'm just a liaison officer and don't have the authority to know the details of this mission, I did ask around about the things you're concerned about, Han Li," Jiao San said, seeing Han Li's expression.

"Oh, tell me," Han Li asked calmly.

"Jintong is currently still in Jiuyuan Tower, and she's not in any danger. The people of Jiuyuan Tower are planning to capture her and present her to the Time Dao Ancestor at the Bodhi banquet. Since the Bodhi banquet is still some time away, Jintong is safe for now, and Jiuyuan Tower might even try to increase her cultivation to make her a more impressive 'gift'," Jiao San said.

Han Li's eyes flashed with understanding as he listened to Jiao San's words.

He had already known the purpose of Jiuyuan Tower's capture of Jintong, but hearing it from Jiao San confirmed his suspicions, and he felt a sense of relief.

"As for you, Han Li, it seems that the higher-ups want you to complete some task, and they'll tell you where Jintong is and how to rescue her. However, I couldn't find out what that task is," Jiao San continued.

"Thank you for your efforts, Jiao San," Han Li said with a bow, but his mind was already racing with thoughts.

He wondered what task the Wheel of Rebirth Hall wanted him to complete, but he couldn't think of anything for the time being, so he just let the thought pass.

"Han Li, don't worry about this. Although our hall's methods are mysterious, we wouldn't harm our own people. You're now a core member of our hall, and we wouldn't plot against you," Jiao San said, returning to the main topic.

"Of course, otherwise I wouldn't have joined the Wheel of Rebirth Hall," Han Li said with a nod.

"I'm glad you understand," Jiao San said, nodding.

The two of them chatted for a few more sentences before ending their conversation.

Han Li thought for a moment, then called out Xueying and Tixi from the flower petal space. He took off the red mask and put on the black mask, using his fingers to activate it.

A dark, black aura emanated from the mask, enveloping his body, and Han Li's figure became indistinct.

Tixi and Xueying looked at him with shock, as they couldn't sense any aura from Han Li, as if he was a void.

"The Wheel of Rebirth Hall is indeed powerful. This black mask's concealment effect is even stronger than my Heaven-avoiding symbol," Xueying exclaimed.

Han Li sensed his own situation and was quite satisfied. He activated the mask again, and his body transformed rapidly, changing into a black-faced, bearded man.

"Tixi, lend me some of your spiritual energy," Han Li said, tapping Tixi's shoulder with his palm, and a devouring force emerged, quickly absorbing Tixi's spiritual energy.

Tixi's expression changed, but she didn't move, allowing Han Li to absorb her energy.

Han Li didn't absorb too much, stopping after a moment. He then closed his eyes.

A short while later, a layer of black aura appeared on his body, emitting a dark, ghostly energy that was identical to Tixi's aura, without any flaws. Anyone who saw Han Li would think he was a cultivator of ghostly arts.

"This...," Xueying's eyes widened in shock.

Tixi also looked at Han Li with a stunned expression.

Because at this moment, Han Li's body and aura were completely different from before, and the black mask had even changed his spiritual aura.
The black mask from the Wheel of Reincarnation could absorb the vital energy of others, merge it with itself, and disguise itself as others. This method was indeed much more clever than a simple shape-shifting technique. Han Li's face lit up with joy, and he nodded in agreement.

"With this mask, your safety is greatly improved. You're going to Jiu Yuan City next, and I'll stay hidden in the Flower Branch Space with Xiao Bai. We don't have any stealth abilities, so we'll just wait here and avoid causing any trouble for you," Tian Lin said.

"Keep an eye on Qu Lin and Lan Yan for me. Qu Lin's physical body is strong, but his Xian God's soul is relatively weak. Tian Lin, your divine powers are just right to restrain him," Han Li transmitted his voice.

"Don't worry, Master, I'll keep a close eye on Qu Lin," Tian Lin replied.

Xiao Bai also patted his chest, making a guarantee.

Han Li smiled, waved his hand, and pulled Xiao Bai and Tian Lin into the Flower Branch Space. Then, he left the underground and emerged outside.

He wore a contemplative expression, quickly transformed into a black light, and flew towards Jin Ge City. He soon entered the city from the west entrance.

Inside the city, everything was calm, with cultivators discussing the upcoming auction event at the Day and Night Pavilion. Even the occasional passing patrols seemed normal.

Han Li observed the scene, knowing that his battle with Chi Meng and the others had not caused any widespread chaos, and that the Day and Night Alliance had successfully suppressed the disturbance. He secretly let out a sigh of relief.

He then moved, flying towards the eastern part of the city.

Jin Ge City was a bustling metropolis, with shops everywhere, mostly with golden decorations, giving off a sense of luxury and extravagance, but lacking the grandeur and majesty of a typical large city.

Han Li couldn't help but admire the Day and Night Alliance, which had managed to survive and thrive among the powerful forces of Jiu Yuan Guan, Bai Zao Shan, and Da Jin Yuan Xian Gong, despite not having any powerful backing. Perhaps it was because of this extravagant yet harmless nature.

Jin Ge City was enormous, and Han Li flew for half a day before stopping at a golden great hall in the eastern part of the city.

The entrance of the great hall had a sign that read "Day and Night Boat Travel" in large characters.

The entrance was bustling with people coming and going.

Han Li walked in, and inside, he found a vast space of several hundred zhang, with people surging forward, all heading towards the inner part of the great hall.

At the inner part of the great hall, there were several dozen entrances, each with a name written above it, corresponding to the names of various locations in the Da Jin Yuan Xian Domain.

Jiu Yuan City, Jin Yuan City, and Bai Zao City were among them, and the most people were entering these three entrances.

Han Li scanned the area, then walked towards the entrance with the sign "Jiu Yuan City".

The Day and Night Boat Travel was a transportation industry under the Day and Night Alliance, which had developed a special flying boat called the Day and Night Flying Boat. This boat could harness the power of the sun and moon, allowing it to fly at incredible speeds, traveling between the major cities of the Da Jin Yuan Xian Domain, transporting goods or passengers.

The Day and Night Flying Boat was not only fast but also cheaper than the transmission arrays. Many small and medium-sized forces, as well as rogue cultivators, preferred it.

Although Jin Ge City had a transmission array connected to Jiu Yuan City, the transmission arrays in the Xian Domain were all under the control of the Heavenly Court, which had strict monitoring arrays, especially with the recent turmoil in the Xian Domain. Han Li didn't want to take the risk, even with the black mask.

Moreover, the Day and Night Flying Boat was fast enough, and it would take less than thirty years to reach Jiu Yuan City.

Han Li entered the Jiu Yuan City entrance, walked through a long corridor, and suddenly found himself in a large hall.

The hall was filled with seats, and many people were already seated. Two Day and Night Alliance cultivators in blue robes stood nearby.

When they saw Han Li enter, one of the cultivators immediately approached him, bowing and saying, "Fellow cultivator, are you here to take the Day and Night Flying Boat to Jiu Yuan City?"

"Not bad," Han Li replied, nodding.

He didn't want to draw attention to himself, so he suppressed his cultivation to the Gold Xian level.

"Fellow cultivator, you're just in time. The flying boat to Jiu Yuan City departs once a month, and the next one is leaving in a day," the cultivator said with a smile.

"Oh, that's great. What's the cost?" Han Li asked, his eyes lighting up.

Just then, a voice came from the side, and four cultivators walked over.

The four cultivators were all at the Gold Xian level, and the leader was an old man in a gray robe with a smile on his face.

Behind him were three people: a young man in black clothes, who looked no more than twenty and had a hint of youthfulness on his face; a woman in a red dress, who was plump and had a beautiful face; and a nun in a white robe, who had a stunning appearance and a high bun on her head, giving the impression that she was a cultivator who had not yet shaved her head. She was also carrying a snow-white long sword on her back, which seemed out of place.

Han Li saw the four people and was taken aback. The reason was that, apart from the young man in black clothes, he recognized the other three.
