Chapter:

“Traitor! Don't run!” The man in white robes flashed a hint of hatred in his eyes and was about to chase after him.

The officials of the Heavenly Court also saw this scene and were about to follow.

White Cloud Daozu and the old dwarf were also filled with hatred, using their seals to heal their wounds, and were about to pursue them.

“Stop right there.” Gu Huo Jin's voice came from the red flame, the golden threads, and the depths of the crimson fire.

The man in white robes and the others immediately stopped.

A wave of golden smoke rolled out from the depths of the red flame, spreading out in all directions, with countless golden symbols dancing within.

The black claws, the red flame, the golden threads, and the golden smoke collided, and they all rapidly decayed, turning into dust and disappearing, leaving only a wave of golden smoke.

The people nearby retreated, avoiding the golden smoke, fearing that they would be tainted by even a single speck.

The golden smoke suddenly gathered and disappeared, revealing Gu Huo Jin's figure, his clothes still intact and unbroken.

"Your Majesty, are you alright?" White Cloud Daozu and the old dwarf forced themselves to reassemble their bodies and flew over.

"This is just a trivial matter, how could I be injured?" Gu Huo Jin replied calmly.

White Cloud Daozu heard this and flashed a hint of excitement in his eyes.

Lunhui Dianzhu, Li Yuanjiu, and Chi Rong were all incredibly powerful, each one capable of ranking among the top ten in the world, yet when they joined forces, Gu Huo Jin remained unscathed, his clothes still intact.

Gu Huo Jin made a hand seal.

Two golden lights shot out from his fingertips, entering White Cloud Daozu and the old dwarf's bodies.

The two of them were instantly enveloped in a golden light, their bodies' severed limbs twisting and reforming, restoring them to their original state.

Not only were their bodies restored, but White Cloud Daozu and the old dwarf's auras also returned to normal, as if they had not been through a fierce battle.

"Time Reversal Divine Ability!" Lunhui Dianzhu, who was watching from a distance, furrowed his brow.

"Thank you, Your Majesty." White Cloud Daozu and the old dwarf moved their bodies, their faces filled with joy, and bowed to Gu Huo Jin in gratitude.

Gu Huo Jin waved his hand, his gaze not on the two of them, but on Li Yuanjiu and Chi Rong.

"Li Yuanjiu, Chi Rong, the Heavenly Court has always treated you with kindness, allowing you to rank among the Seven Lords, and even promising to lead you beyond the constraints of the Heavenly Way. Why have you betrayed me and joined forces with the Lunhui Dianzhu?"

White Cloud Daozu also looked at Li Yuanjiu and Chi Rong, questioning them.

The other people in the Yaochi also looked at Li Yuanjiu and Chi Rong, their faces filled with doubt.

However, the three Cangwu True Lords were shocked, their bodies trembling slightly, their eyes flashing with surprise.

Earlier, during the conversation between Lunhui Dianzhu and Gu Huo Jin, they had mentioned surpassing the Heavenly Way, and they had thought that Gu Huo Jin was just speaking to counter Lunhui Dianzhu.

But now, hearing White Cloud Daozu's words, they realized that Gu Huo Jin was actually working on this, and seemed to have already made progress.

As Daozu, they were most concerned about resisting the Heavenly Way's erosion, and if there was a way to surpass it, they would do anything to know.

"It seems that White Cloud Dao friend has not noticed anything, but be careful, don't be fooled by Gu Huo Jin's words." Li Yuanjiu smiled calmly.

"How dare you, you're slandering the Emperor!" White Cloud Daozu was taken aback, then quickly became angry again.

"Is it slander? You'll find out soon enough." Li Yuanjiu chuckled, retreating behind Lunhui Dianzhu.

Chi Rong also retreated, allowing Lunhui Dianzhu to stand at the front.

"Gentlemen of the True Immortal Realm, I have come to the Bodhi banquet not to cause trouble, but to tell you something." Lunhui Dianzhu began to speak, his voice carrying far and wide.

Gu Huo Jin's brow furrowed slightly, but quickly relaxed.

"This matter has been planned by Gu Huo Jin for a long time, so long that some people may not have even started their cultivation journey yet. Gu Huo Jin's plan is enormous, violating the norms of humanity, and he is the greatest villain of our time, deserving of punishment!" Lunhui Dianzhu pointed at Gu Huo Jin, his eyes wide with anger.

"How dare you!"

"You're the one who's a traitor, how dare you speak such evil words? You're the one who deserves to be punished!"

The people of the Heavenly Court were outraged.

"Are you here to spout nonsense? You say I'm the greatest villain, but what evidence do you have?" Gu Huo Jin remained calm, smiling.

"You're quite bold, aren't you? You're the one who's speaking evil words, and you're the one who deserves to be punished!"
This matter is long and complex, and if we want to start from the beginning, we need to go back to a very ancient era. I'm sure all of you fellow practitioners know that once a cultivator has fully mastered a law, they can reach the realm of the Dao Ancestor, and although they can borrow the power of the Heavenly Dao, they also face the risk of being devoured by the Heavenly Dao. This is the underlying fear of all Dao Ancestors.

Throughout the ages, various Dao Ancestors have sought to find a way to escape this fate. Some have tried to cultivate the secret art of firming their minds to resist the Heavenly Dao, while others have attempted to refine special immortal artifacts to resist the Heavenly Dao's erosion. There have also been those who have tried to mimic the Earth Immortal, guiding the power of faith into their bodies. Unfortunately, these methods have all had little effect.

However, during the nineteenth generation of the Heavenly Court, during the reign of the previous Supreme Ruler, the situation changed. The nineteenth generation Supreme Ruler was a heaven-defying genius who entered the Dao through arrays, not only mastering the law of time to the realm of the Dao Ancestor, but also creating an unparalleled divine ability that fused different attributes of the law into one, shaking the various realms.

The nearby cultivators looked at each other in shock, intimidated by Gu Yunjin's aura, and dared not express their surprise openly, instead whispering to each other in secret.

Fusing different attributes of the law is extremely difficult, and can only be achieved through the constant grinding and hard work of two cultivators. It is unbelievable that someone has created a divine ability that can fuse laws through arrays.

Gu Yunjin's eyes flickered with a strange light as he listened to the Wheel of Rebirth's words.

"Perhaps you are all unfamiliar with this name," the Wheel of Rebirth said with a smile, "but Gu Yunjin, and the various Dao Ancestors of the Heavenly Court, should know this name. Gu Daosheng, the nineteenth generation Supreme Ruler, was a master of arrays, and his divine ability was unparalleled in the world."

The cultivators in the audience looked at each other in surprise, their faces filled with a mixture of emotions.

"Gu Daosheng...?" The name echoed in the minds of the cultivators, and they couldn't help but wonder if there was a connection between Gu Daosheng and Gu Yunjin.

White Cloud Dao Ancestor looked at Gu Yunjin, his eyes cold and detached. "Enough of this nonsense. You've brought people from the Demon Realm and the Barbarian Realm to our Heavenly Court, and you've even turned against Li Yuanji and Chi Rong. If you want to go to war with us, then let's do it. Why waste our time with idle chatter?"

However, his words were equivalent to acknowledging the Wheel of Rebirth's statement, and the cultivators in the audience looked at each other with a mixture of emotions.

"Since this is a true story, why not tell us more?" the Wheel of Rebirth said with a smile. "Are you afraid that we'll discover your secrets?"

The cultivators in the audience looked at each other, their faces filled with a mixture of emotions, and they couldn't help but wonder if the Wheel of Rebirth's words were true.

Originally, some of the cultivators had planned to side with the Heavenly Court, but they had now changed their minds.

White Cloud Dao Ancestor's face was stern, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease.

As for Gu Yunjin, he remained calm and detached, as if he didn't care about the Wheel of Rebirth's words.

"Supreme Ruler, I don't know what he wants to say, but I think we should stop him from spreading his lies. We have the advantage in numbers, and with your divine ability, I think we have at least a 70% chance of winning. As for the cultivators from the various realms, even if they don't help us, they won't dare to side with the Wheel of Rebirth."

The dwarf elder's words were laced with anxiety, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of urgency.

"Let him speak," Gu Yunjin said calmly. "What else do you want to say, Wheel of Rebirth?"

White Cloud Dao Ancestor and the dwarf elder looked at each other, their faces filled with a mixture of emotions, and they knew that they had no choice but to let the Wheel of Rebirth continue.

"Very well, I'll continue," the Wheel of Rebirth said with a smile. "Gu Daosheng discovered that using multiple laws simultaneously could resist the Heavenly Dao, and so he created the 'Dao God Seal' divine ability, which could delay the Heavenly Dao's erosion. The Bodhi Dao Fruit that you Dao Ancestors use to delay the Heavenly Dao's erosion is actually imbued with the power of the Dao God Seal."

The cultivators in the audience looked at each other in surprise, and they finally understood the truth about the Bodhi Dao Fruit.

The Cangwu True Lord looked at the Wheel of Rebirth with a mixture of emotions, his heart filled with a sense of complexity.

He had previously thought that the Wheel of Rebirth was reckless and impulsive, but now he realized that the Wheel of Rebirth had actually been planning this all along, and had even gathered information that he had never heard of before.

In comparison, he was just a frog at the bottom of a well.

He had originally wanted to take revenge, but now he felt a sense of despair and hopelessness.

"Since you know so much, you must have prepared well," Gu Yunjin said calmly.

"Gu Daosheng's 'Dao God Seal' is just a small divine ability," the Wheel of Rebirth said with a smile. "What he truly devoted his life to was the 'Three Thousand Dao God Great Array'. Gu Yunjin, you wouldn't know about this, would you? After all, you were the one who helped him complete this great array, back when you were still a self-cultivator."

The Wheel of Rebirth's words were like a bombshell, and the cultivators in the audience looked at Gu Yunjin in shock and disbelief.

White Cloud Dao Ancestor and the dwarf elder also looked at Gu Yunjin, their faces filled with a mixture of emotions.

"What...?" The audience erupted into chaos, and the cultivators looked at each other in shock and confusion.
