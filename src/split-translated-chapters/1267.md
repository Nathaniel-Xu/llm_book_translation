"How are you?" the giant blue bird asked.

"I'm fine, but that demonic cloud was terrifying. The illusions created by the demons were getting stronger and stronger, and I almost couldn't withstand them. Luckily, you flew out in time, or I would have been completely engulfed. The consequences would have been unthinkable." Xiao Bai said with a lingering sense of fear.

"That's to be expected. Otherwise, why would the demonic cloud be known as the most feared existence in the outer void? This cloud is actually small, if we had encountered a larger one, I wouldn't have been able to fly out quickly." the giant blue bird said.

"I didn't think the outer void was so dangerous... I think it's better to be cautious and move slowly from now on, even if it's slower. At least it's safer! By the way, Master, how are you?" Xiao Bai asked, turning to look at Han Li.

Han Li was sitting cross-legged, his brow furrowed, and his eyes closed. A faint aura of malevolent energy surrounded his body.

As if he had heard Xiao Bai's question, Han Li opened his eyes, and a flash of blood-red light flickered in his pupils.

"Your eyes... have you been controlled by the demons? Get out of my master's body, you demon!" Xiao Bai exclaimed, jumping up and shouting.

"I'm fine, I wasn't controlled, just influenced a bit." Han Li said calmly.

Xiao Bai looked at Han Li with a mixture of surprise and concern.

"Good kid, I thought you wouldn't be able to resist the demon's influence, but you managed to hold on. However, it seems that the evil thoughts in your body have surged out of control, and you can't suppress them." the giant blue bird said with a faint smile.

"Senior, you're right, I didn't expect you to see through everything." Han Li said with a wry smile.

The evil thoughts in his body had not increased, but they had not decreased either. Moreover, these evil thoughts were different from before, and no matter how hard he tried to use the time law or the Yuancheng chain, he couldn't suppress them.

"The three corpses of humanity are tied to the fundamental spirit and will, and are incredibly mysterious. I don't know what method or opportunity you used to forcibly summon the evil corpse, but your cultivation is not yet sufficient. Although you've managed to suppress it, the influence of the demonic cloud has made it difficult to control. You should find a way to get rid of it as soon as possible, or it will eventually take over your body." the giant blue bird said calmly.

Han Li's face was expressionless as he listened to the giant blue bird's words.

Yue Meng had said similar things before, and Han Li had considered them, but he didn't know how to get rid of the evil corpse. On the one hand, his cultivation was not yet sufficient, and on the other hand, he had no experience with getting rid of corpses.

The giant blue bird didn't say anything else and continued on their journey.

After flying for half a day, the giant blue bird suddenly descended, and they passed through the Tianfeng domain and the Qingming domain, arriving near the ground.

The ground below was a lush mountain range, and they had already entered the Barbarian Domain.

After flying for a while, a majestic mountain peak appeared in front of them, which was the Eight Wastes Mountain.

Han Li was secretly shocked by Yue Meng's speed, as he had taken decades to fly from the Eight Wastes Mountain to the Great Jin Yuan Xian Domain, while Yue Meng had returned in less than a day.

He suddenly had an idea and flew down from the giant blue bird's back, standing in mid-air, and said to Yue Meng:

"Senior Yue, thank you for bringing me back to the Barbarian Domain. However, my identity is special, and I'm afraid that if I go to the Eight Wastes Mountain, I will attract unwanted attention. I'll just stay here."

Yue Meng had stopped flying and restored his human form, his body surrounded by a dazzling blue glow.

He looked at Han Li and said calmly:

"Do as you please."

Just then, a voice suddenly rang out, and a white figure appeared, which was Bai Ze, who said with a smile:

"Ha ha, Han Li, you've come to the Eight Wastes Mountain, but you're not going to enter? That would be impolite to the various tribes of the Barbarian Domain."

Han Li quickly bowed and said:

"Senior Bai Ze."

Xiao Bai also bowed.

"Ha ha, Han Li, you're indeed extraordinary, stirring up trouble at the Nine Yuan Observatory and making Li Yuan lose face. That's great, just great!" Bai Ze laughed.

"That's not true, Master and I worked together to kill our way out of the Nine Yuan Observatory, and two of the four saintly envoys were beaten and fled." Xiao Bai said proudly.

"That was all due to the Wheel of Rebirth, and I just happened to be there. I didn't do anything." Han Li said modestly.

"Getting involved in the Nine Yuan Observatory's turmoil and escaping unscathed is no easy feat. As for you, Han Li, you've made rapid progress, reaching the early stage of the Mahayana period, and you're not far from the middle stage. Even if you and I were in our youth, we wouldn't have achieved this speed." Bai Ze said with a smile.

"Senior, you're flattering me." Han Li said calmly.

Bai Ze shook his head and smiled, then turned to Xiao Bai and said:

"Xiao Bai is my friend, and I should protect him. However, he's strong enough to take care of himself. I should thank you for bringing him back to the Barbarian Domain safely."

Han Li smiled and said:

"I didn't do anything, it was all thanks to Senior Yue Meng. As for bringing Xiao Bai back safely, it was all due to his own strength and my luck."

Bai Ze chuckled and said:

"Let's not talk about gratitude. Since you've come to the Eight Wastes Mountain, why don't you come in and rest for a while?"
Han Li bowed his head in gratitude. "Thank you, Senior White Ze, for your kind invitation. However, I'm afraid I'm not feeling well at the moment, and I'd like to find a place to cultivate immediately. Please excuse me."

White Ze looked Han Li up and down, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes before he spoke. "Since you have something to attend to, I won't keep you here. Thirty million li to the east, there's a mountain range called the Cuiyun Mountains. The spiritual energy there is rich and there are no barbarian tribes occupying it. You can go there to cultivate in seclusion."

"Thank you, Senior White Ze, for your guidance." Han Li's face lit up with joy as he bowed in gratitude.

"Master, I'll go with you!" Xiao Bai exclaimed, her face urgent as she looked at White Ze. "Since the Cuiyun Mountains are close by, I can go there to cultivate too, right?"

"No, you must stay here and continue your cultivation as planned," White Ze replied, his face stern.

"Okay," Xiao Bai said, this time not arguing further.

"Seniors, Xiao Bai, I'll take my leave now." Han Li bowed to the three of them and transformed into a golden rainbow, flying off towards the east.

White Ze and the others watched Han Li disappear into the distance before descending back down to the Ba Huang Mountains.

Han Li flew east for a while before arriving at the Cuiyun Mountains. The mountains and rocks here were all a deep green color, looking quite unusual. The spiritual energy was indeed rich and dense, just as White Ze had said, and it was calm and peaceful, unlike other places where the energy was turbulent. This was indeed an ideal place for Han Li to cultivate in seclusion.

After calming his mind, Han Li found a suitable location and opened up a cave, setting up a restriction array around it. He then summoned the Spatial Door and stepped through it, entering the Flower Branch Space.

Tieying and Jintong were already waiting for him at the entrance. When they saw Han Li, they rushed over to greet him.

"Tieying, you know about the situation with the Tianmo Clouds. Now, I need your help to try and suppress the evil thoughts. See if you can assist me in any way," Han Li said, sitting down cross-legged and closing his eyes.

Tieying nodded, placing her hand on Han Li's head. A dark red glow erupted from her body, covering Han Li's head and forming a layer of light.

Han Li let out a muffled groan, and his body began to glow with a faint, flickering light. A dark, swirling energy emerged from his body, swirling around him like a living thing.

As soon as this energy touched the dark red glow surrounding Han Li, it let out a hissing sound and dissipated. However, the energy emerging from Han Li's body only grew stronger, as if it was increasing in power.

Jintong's eyes were wide with concern as she watched Han Li, but she didn't say anything, instead choosing to stand guard silently, her eyes fixed on Han Li.

However, after three days and three nights, the dark energy surrounding Han Li showed no signs of weakening. Jintong's face was etched with worry as she glanced back and forth between Han Li and Tieying, her eyes welling up with tears.

"Master, you can't have anything happen to you!" she whispered to herself.

"Stop, Tieying," Han Li suddenly said, opening his eyes.

"Master, the evil thoughts in your body seem different from before," Tieying said, withdrawing her hand.

"You've noticed it too," Han Li said with a wry smile, not explaining further. He raised his hand, stopping Jintong from speaking up.

The evil thoughts were still present, and it seemed that they couldn't be eliminated. The only solution was to break through to the middle stage of the Daluo Realm as quickly as possible. But how could he do that?

He didn't have a master to guide him, and the last time he had spoken to the Old Ancestor, he hadn't mentioned anything about breaking through. It seemed that he would have to rely on himself to figure it out.

Han Li pondered for a moment before putting his thoughts aside. He turned to Tieying and Jintong and said, "I'm going to open up the Time Difference Space and cultivate in seclusion. I need to break through to the middle stage of the Daluo Realm as quickly as possible. You two don't need to worry about me; just focus on your own cultivation. If you can increase your strength, you'll be able to help me even more in the future."

With that, he opened up his spiritual domain, covering the surrounding area. He then activated the Time Difference Space, causing the flow of time to speed up by a factor of ten thousand.

Tieying and Jintong were still worried about Han Li's situation, but they hesitated for a moment before sitting down to cultivate on either side of him.
