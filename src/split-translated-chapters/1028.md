The Jin Yuan mountain range, a remote mountain peak, was shrouded in dark clouds, with a steady drizzle falling from the sky.

A loud thunderclap echoed through the air!

In the midst of the dark clouds, a silver flash of lightning intertwined with the clouds, and a brilliant lightning array flashed into existence, only to disappear in an instant.

As the lightning faded, two figures fell from the sky, landing with a thud on the peak's dense forest.

The sound of impact echoed through the air, as ancient trees, thick as several men, snapped and broke, until the two figures finally stopped rolling and collapsed beside a massive boulder.

"Master!"

A urgent cry rang out, as a black-clad girl, ignoring her own injuries, quickly helped the battered blue-robed man to his feet.

"I'm fine, my injuries are under control, but this ordeal has left me exhausted, both physically and spiritually." The blue-robed man wiped the rain from his face, and smiled wryly.

The man was none other than Han Li, who had fled from the Jin Yuan Immortal Palace to this place.

"That Qi Mozi is truly despicable, taking advantage of Master's weakened state after his battle with Dong Fang Bai..." The black-clad girl, Ti Huan, complained, but was cut off by Han Li.

"As the saying goes, 'man plans, but heaven decides'. I didn't expect Qi Mozi to show up. We're not safe yet, we need to rest for a while, then continue on our way." Han Li took a deep breath, and said.

Ti Huan nodded silently, and remained quiet.

Han Li took out a medicinal pill, and swallowed it, then sat down cross-legged, and began to meditate.

A short while later, he opened his eyes, and stood up, his eyes gleaming with a hint of spiritual energy. Ti Huan, who had been sitting nearby, quickly stood up, and approached him.

"Master, this time, aside from Qi Mozi, we need to be prepared for more pursuers. Before we attacked the Jin Yuan Immortal Palace, Dong Fang Bai had contact with a powerful being from the Jiu Yuan Observatory, who said they would send the Lan siblings to capture us." Ti Huan spoke quickly.

"The Lan siblings..." Han Li murmured.

"They seem to be quite powerful, Dong Fang Bai's memories of them are limited, but he trusts them." Ti Huan added.

"Regardless, we've already killed Dong Fang Bai, and we don't need to entangle ourselves with them again. It's best to leave here as soon as possible. The Jin Yuan Immortal Palace's influence is mainly concentrated in the western part of the Jin Yuan mountain range, while the central and eastern parts are controlled by various immortal sects and aristocratic families. It's a complex web of power, and we can easily hide our tracks there. Let's head there first." Han Li shook his head, and said.

"Alright!" Ti Huan nodded, and replied.

"Ti Huan, to avoid being tracked, I'll temporarily seal my spiritual energy, and use my physical body to travel as quickly as possible, hiding my spiritual energy fluctuations. You should stay in the flower branch cave, and rest." Han Li said, and with a wave of his hand, a silver light door opened.

Ti Huan didn't say anything, and quickly entered the light door, returning to the bamboo pavilion.

Han Li closed the light door, and looked up at the sky, his body suddenly rising into the air, as he leapt into the clouds.

...

Two years passed.

In the central part of the Jin Yuan mountain range, a small, unassuming mountain valley, called Qing Si Valley, was nestled among the winding mountains.

In this valley, there was a small, secluded village, called Yu Liang Village, where several hundred villagers lived, rarely interacting with the outside world.

On this particular night, the village was bustling with activity, as all the villagers, dressed in their finest clothes, carried torches, and beat drums, as they made their way to the foot of a nearby mountain.

On the stretchers they carried, were old men with white hair, all of whom appeared to be on the brink of death.

Among the villagers, a tall, blue-robed man stood out, looking somewhat out of place.

He walked alongside the village head, and asked, "Village head, where are we going?"

The village head, who appeared to be a young man, but with eyes that seemed aged, hesitated, before responding, "We're going to the White Head Valley, behind the mountain."

The blue-robed man, who was addressed as Han Daifu, was none other than Han Li, who had been hiding in the village for the past half month.

He had arrived in the village by chance, and had helped to cure a plague that had been afflicting the villagers, earning their gratitude, and staying on as a traveling doctor.
Han Li didn't want to linger here, but after staying in the village for two days, he discovered some unusual things, such as the village chief in front of him, who looked like he was only in his 40s, but was actually over 500 years old.

Even though the lifespan of ordinary people in the immortal realm was long, it was usually only around 200 years, and without a spiritual root, he shouldn't be able to live more than twice the lifespan of an ordinary person. This was clearly abnormal.

However, what was even more unusual was that there were more people like the village chief, who had lived for hundreds of years.

"White Haired Valley... what's going on there?" Han Li asked in confusion.

"Never mind, Doctor Han has helped us drive away the plague, and is considered a lifesaver for our village. I won't hide it from you. Look at the people being carried on the bamboo stretcher, how old do you think they are?" The village chief stopped and said.

"From their appearance, I'd say they're around 150 years old?" Han Li pretended to think and guessed.

"Not bad, they're indeed around 150 years old, but in reality, they're my juniors. I'm already 513 years old." The village chief nodded and said.

"What?" Han Li feigned shock and said.

"Doctor Han, don't be too surprised. There are people in the village like me, or even older than me." The village chief saw Han Li's expression and chuckled, patting his shoulder.

"Is it... did you all obtain some kind of spiritual medicine or immortal technique?" Han Li asked.

"Where did you get that idea? It's all thanks to the clear spring in White Haired Valley." The village chief shook his head and continued walking.

"Clear spring? What kind of spring water can make people live so long?" Han Li asked in surprise.

"I'm not too sure myself. This clear spring is very strange, it only appears once every hundred years. Every time it appears, we'll carry the villagers who are on the brink of death into the valley, and have them soak in the spring water for a day and a night, then bring them back." The village chief said.

"Is it... can you really regain your youth by soaking in the spring water?" Han Li raised an eyebrow and asked.

"It's not that simple. This spiritual spring is also unpredictable, sometimes it can make people regain their youth, but sometimes it can also make them wither away. It all depends on luck." The village chief said.

"I see... " Han Li nodded, seeming to understand.

"Doctor Han, you're currently in your prime, don't try this. This spiritual spring can make people regain their youth, but it can't cure illnesses. If someone gets a serious disease, they'll still die. I'm telling you this because I want to keep you in our village, to help us treat various illnesses, and in the future, we can all enjoy a long lifespan together." The village chief said.

"Doctor Han is just a wandering doctor, it's an honor to receive the village chief's praise, but this is a big decision for me. Can I think about it for a day or two before giving an answer?" Han Li said with a difficult expression.

"Ha ha, no problem, Doctor Han can take his time." The village chief also laughed and said.

The two of them followed the crowd and continued walking, chatting about ordinary things. The village chief asked Han Li about his family, and if he had married.

As they spoke, he wanted to introduce a young girl from the village who was over 100 years old, but still looked like a maiden, to Han Li. Han Li was left speechless.

The crowd finally arrived at White Haired Valley, and it was already midnight. The valley was quiet and still, with only the sound of drums and cymbals. The villagers all looked solemn, their eyes filled with reverence.

As they entered the valley, Han Li saw two giant boulders, leaning against each other, forming a human-shaped space. Below it was a clear spring, about ten feet in diameter.

The water in the spring was crystal clear, and even in the moonlight and firelight, you could see the mud and leaves at the bottom, as well as the bubbling spring water.

The crowd gathered around the spring, clasping their hands together in prayer, while the village chief began to recite a ritual text.

Han Li took advantage of the distraction to quietly scoop up some water from the spring, and examined it carefully. He raised an eyebrow, seeming to notice something.

The village chief then ordered the villagers to carry the elderly people into the spring, and they were placed in the water with great care.

The elderly people all closed their eyes and sat cross-legged, as the water rippled around them. The village chief then led the crowd in bowing three times to the spring, and they all left the valley, waiting for the next day to see the results.

On the way back, the villagers were no longer solemn, and they quickly returned to the village. Han Li bid farewell to the village chief and returned to his hut.

However, just half an hour later, a figure flashed out of the hut and disappeared into the village.
