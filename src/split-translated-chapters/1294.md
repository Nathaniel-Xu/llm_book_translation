At this moment, a black light descended from the sky, enveloping the scattered white smoke and emitting a massive suction force.

The scattered smoke rolled towards the black light, gathering together, and despite the white light clusters' struggles to escape, they were ultimately absorbed one by one.

After a few breaths, all the smoke and light clusters were swallowed up.

The black light quickly shrunk, revealing Tiuhun's figure.

Her aura had risen significantly, but was somewhat unstable, rolling and tumbling.

"Are you okay?" Han Li asked, looking at Tiuhun.

"I'm fine, this wild soul contains a vast amount of ghostly energy, and it's filled with violent and brutal energy, it will take some time to refine it," Tiuhun replied, then immediately sat down cross-legged.

Shi Chuankong and the others flew over.

"Brother Han, it's been a while, I didn't expect your cultivation to have reached this level, leaving us old friends far behind," Shi Chuankong said, his eyes flashing with a complex expression, a mix of admiration and envy.

He had spent years cultivating in the Demon Realm, with some assistance from the Daoist Crab and a lot of resources, but had only just reached the Daluo Realm.

"Brother Han has just had some opportunities, with your talent, you'll soon surpass me," Han Li said with a smile.

Shi Chuankong rolled his eyes and turned away from Han Li.

Zi Ling and Jin Tong stared at Han Li in silence.

"What's going on, don't you recognize me?" Han Li asked with a chuckle.

"Such a big uncle, I've never seen one before," Jin Tong said with a laugh.

"Enough joking around, Tiuhun is cultivating to refine the ghostly energy of that wild soul, it will take some time, let's wait for her," Han Li said.

Jin Tong and Zi Ling nodded and sat down beside him.

"With Brother Han's presence, what's there to be afraid of?" Shi Chuankong laughed and sat down cross-legged.

Han Li also walked over and stood still, quietly waiting for Tiuhun.

"I originally overestimated your strength, but now it seems I underestimated you. Brother Han, what level has your strength reached?" Gui Wu's voice echoed in his ear.

"No need to report, sir, you can think whatever you like," Han Li replied calmly.

Gui Wu laughed dryly and fell silent again.

In the blink of an eye, two days passed, and during this time, there were many ghostly beast attacks, but the wild soul did not appear again.

Tiuhun's body was surrounded by black light, and her originally chaotic aura quickly became calm.

After another day, Tiuhun suddenly opened her eyes and let out a long, piercing cry, the sound like a phoenix's cry, or a tiger's roar, clear and high, causing the nearby sky to rumble in response.

Shi Chuankong and the others woke up with a start, looking at Tiuhun.

They saw that she was surrounded by black light, and her aura had risen even higher.

Moreover, her skin had a series of black lines, similar to the blood vessels of a true spirit.

And behind her, a faint black shadow appeared, unknown what it was.

Han Li's face also showed a look of surprise.

That faint black shadow gave him a very mysterious feeling.

"It seems that the Xing Beast bloodline in her body has begun to awaken," Gui Wu's voice echoed in Han Li's mind.

"Xing Beast bloodline? From your words, I suppose Xing Beast is a tribe?" Han Li asked, his eyes flashing with curiosity.

Tiuhun being a Xing Beast was something he had known for a long time, but what Xing Beast was, he had never been able to investigate clearly.

"Of course, Xing Beast is a mysterious tribe in the Underworld, living in the depths of the Underworld, rarely appearing in the mortal world, and it's a rare occurrence for the Underworld King to have an alliance with me and Xue Lie, the ruler of the three realms. The Xing Beast's innate divine abilities are extremely powerful, and their reputation is known throughout the various realms, Brother Han, don't think that you're currently powerful, but if Tiuhun awakens the Xing Beast bloodline, you may not be able to withstand her innate divine abilities," Gui Wu said with a chuckle.

"Is that so? Then I'll be looking forward to it," Han Li said.

Tiuhun quickly stopped her cry, stood up, and said with a apologetic expression, "I've kept Shi Dao friend and Zi Ling Dao friend waiting for three days, I'm truly sorry."

These three days, Tiuhun had been cultivating, but her perception of the outside world had not been cut off.

"Tiuhun Dao friend is too polite, we're traveling together, of course, we'll support each other, Tiuhun Dao friend's strength has made great progress, congratulations," Shi Chuankong said with a smile, but his heart was not happy.

Han Li's strength was now far superior to his, and it seemed that Tiuhun's strength was also above his.

That Jin Tong had not made a move, but seemed to be a mysterious and unfathomable person, making him even more cautious.

"We've stayed for a long time, let's go," Han Li said.

The others naturally had no objections, and the group continued on their way.

With Han Li's formidable strength as a guarantee, the group's speed increased significantly.

In the blink of an eye, several days passed, and the group had already reached the center of the Hundred Ghosts Forest.

Along the way, they encountered many ghostly beasts, but they were all easily killed, and they even encountered another wild soul, which was weaker than the previous one, and was killed by Han Li, allowing Tiuhun to absorb it.
The central region of the Hundred Ghost Forest had an even thicker atmosphere of yin energy, and some rare spiritual herbs began to appear.

Han Li and his companions didn't have the intention of searching for treasures, so they didn't waste their time and continued on their way.

Near a mountain range in the central region, the sound of thunderous explosions and ear-piercing wails echoed through the air once again.

Two figures, one black and one white, clashed intensely, and it was clear that they were Qī Hún and another Rú Hún ghost.

This Rú Hún was similar to the previous two, with a pale complexion, but its cultivation was stronger.

As they exchanged blows, their movements became faster and faster, and their shadows began to blur and merge, making it difficult to distinguish between them. The intense black and white lights intertwined, forming a vortex of explosive energy.

The entire sky shook violently, and countless thin white streaks appeared in the surrounding void, radiating in all directions.

The nearby forest was flattened, and the clouds in the sky were torn apart.

Han Li stood on a giant tree, watching the battle from a distance, and didn't intervene.

Shí Chuān Kōng, Jīn Tóng, and the others stood nearby, watching the battle, as Qī Hún had requested.

"Who would have thought that Qī Hún could take on a Rú Hún by herself?" Shí Chuān Kōng exclaimed.

"Qī Hún's divine ability is specifically effective against ghostly creatures, and she's able to take on this Rú Hún... the outcome is already decided." Han Li said calmly.

As soon as he finished speaking, the black and white vortex in front of them suddenly surged, and the black light suppressed the white light.

A blurry black shadow emerged from the black light, and it was clear that it was the same shadow that had appeared behind Qī Hún earlier. This time, the shadow was much clearer, and it resembled a giant black ape, which opened its mouth and took a deep breath.

A mysterious wave of energy enveloped the white light, and the Rú Hún's face contorted in terror as it tried to escape. However, it was too late.

As soon as it flew out, its head suddenly split open, and a ball of white light flew out, which was swallowed by the black ape's shadow.

The Rú Hún's body exploded, and a dense, dark mist spread out in all directions.

"This is the true power of the Xíng Shòu's divine ability, which seems to be a direct attack on the soul." Han Li thought to himself.

"Xī Hún... no wonder it's known as the most powerful soul-attacking technique." Guǐ Wū's voice echoed once again, filled with admiration.

Han Li's soul was strong, and he could feel the shockwave of Qī Hún's "Xī Hún" attack, which made his eyebrows furrow slightly.

His time laws had already reached a high level, and he was confident that he could withstand any strange attack. However, soul attacks were an exception.

Soul attacks were completely different from law-based attacks, and it was difficult for law-based powers to interfere.

Although Han Li's soul was much stronger than others due to his cultivation of the Liàn Hún technique, he still found it difficult to defend against the Xī Hún attack.

As he thought about this, the black ape's shadow suddenly disappeared, as if it couldn't sustain itself for long.

However, the black light that Qī Hún had transformed into began to spin rapidly, forming a giant black vortex that emitted a powerful suction force.

The surrounding dark energy was sucked in, and the vortex quickly shrunk and disappeared. Qī Hún's aura surged once again.

A series of black light points appeared around her, numbering 839, which was the peak of the Dà Luó initial stage.

Her body once again displayed a series of black patterns, which were clearer than before.

Qī Hún looked at her body and smiled in surprise.

Han Li and the others flew over and landed near Qī Hún.

"Qī Hún, you're incredible! That black ape shadow was a divine ability, and it was a one-hit kill!" Jīn Tóng exclaimed.

"Do you need time to refine it?" Han Li asked, feeling Qī Hún's aura and smiling.

"No, for some reason, the backlash from the Rú Hún's ghostly energy is not strong, and I can suppress it. Let's not waste everyone's time and continue on our way." Qī Hún said, retracting the black light around her.

"Because the Xíng Shòu's bloodline is awakening... that's good." Han Li nodded.

The group continued on their way, but soon, Guǐ Wū suddenly exclaimed in surprise.

"What's wrong?" Han Li asked via transmission.

"Good fortune! Truly good fortune! Han Li, head left and forward!" Guǐ Wū urged.

Han Li raised an eyebrow but followed Guǐ Wū's instructions and flew in the specified direction.

Shí Chuān Kōng and the others followed closely behind, although they were curious about Han Li's sudden change in direction.

After a few breaths, Han Li arrived at a black mountain peak, following Guǐ Wū's guidance.

Behind the mountain peak was a dark valley, where a pool of water reflected the sky, emitting a dense, dark energy.

Near the pool was a patch of green bamboo, which swayed gently in the wind.

"Is this what you were so excited about?" Han Li asked, looking at the bamboo.

The green bamboo was filled with dark energy, but it didn't seem to have any special properties.

Guǐ Wū's voice echoed once again, filled with excitement.
