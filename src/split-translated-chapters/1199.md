The noble alliance master's insight is truly remarkable. Han Li's eyebrows twitched, and he nodded in agreement.

As he spoke, his divine sense had already entered the jade slip, and his face slightly changed.

The jade slip listed over ten thousand auction items, including their starting prices, and was extremely clear and concise.

However, the auction order was not indicated, but this was not difficult to understand. If the guests knew the auction details too clearly, it would lack some excitement.

With Han Li's current memory ability, he quickly finished looking through the auction items, memorized them, and had a rough idea of what he wanted to bid on.

"Where do the two seniors come from? What treasures do you want to buy? Are you preparing for the Great Luo breakthrough?" Lan Mei asked.

"We are wandering cultivators, always on the move, and we came to the Day and Night Pavilion's auction without a specific goal in mind. We'll just take a look," Han Li said with a chuckle.

"Ah, I see. We, the Day and Night Pavilion, place great importance on this auction, and have prepared many precious items, including immortal artifacts, elixirs, materials, and techniques. Everything is available, and the two seniors can browse at will, and participate in the auction if they see something they like," Lan Mei said with a smile.

Han Li nodded and asked a few more questions about the auction, and Lan Mei answered them in detail, making Han Li quite satisfied.

On the side, Qi Huan saw Han Li and Lan Mei chatting and laughing, and couldn't help but pout, refusing to acknowledge them, and closed her eyes to examine the jade slip.

Before long, Lan Mei brought Han Li and Qi Huan to a separate room.

The room was not large, only two to three zhang in size, with a long, narrow chair and a white stone table, on which were placed spiritual tea, immortal fruits, and other extraordinary items.

Although the room was simply decorated, it gave a sense of cleanliness and tidiness, and the air was filled with a faint, refreshing fragrance, which was calming to the mind.

The room was enclosed on all sides, except for the front, which had a transparent window, allowing them to see the large square in front, which was over 20 to 30 li in size, and was filled with seats, almost all of which were occupied by people waiting for the auction to begin.

The noble guest seats, like Han Li's, were in a fan shape, floating in mid-air.

"Alright, I don't need you to attend to me, you can go now," Han Li said, nodding in satisfaction, and then turned to Lan Mei.

"Yes, if the two seniors need to summon me, just ring this small bell," Lan Mei replied, placing a yellow copper bell on the table, and then withdrew.

After she left, Han Li waved his sleeve, and a layer of blue light enveloped the entire room.

"Qi Huan, why haven't you spoken up?" he asked, turning to Qi Huan.

"Master, you and that little girl were chatting so intimately, I didn't dare interrupt," Qi Huan replied, her face still, and her eyes not meeting Han Li's.

"There's nothing intimate about it, I was just asking her about the auction details," Han Li said with a hint of amusement.

Qi Huan's expression slightly improved, but she still let out a soft snort.

"Alright, the auction is about to begin, don't be stubborn. You looked at the jade slip for so long, did you see anything you liked?" Han Li asked.

"I did see two immortal artifacts, but their starting prices are not low, and it will likely take a lot of spirit stones to bid on them," Qi Huan said, her face showing hesitation.

"Those two artifacts are indeed suitable for you, and as for the spirit stones, don't worry about it," Han Li said, his divine sense examining the two artifacts and their starting prices, his brow furrowing slightly, but then relaxing into a smile.

He had previously used the Light Shadow Heavenly Array to cultivate, consuming nearly 20 million spirit stones, and now he had 50 million spirit stones left. Although the two artifacts were valuable, the laws they contained were relatively rare, and he estimated that there wouldn't be many bidders, so it shouldn't be a problem to bid on them.

He had reached the Great Luo realm, and couldn't make any new breakthroughs in the short term, so he didn't need to use the time difference space for now, and could use the spirit stones.

"Thank you, Master!" Qi Huan exclaimed, her face lighting up with joy.

Just then, a series of calls echoed in Han Li's mind, and it was the Flame Boy from the Flower Branch Space.

Although the calls didn't form a sentence, Han Li understood the Flame Boy's meaning, and it needed some fire-type yuan force to replenish its previous consumption.

"No problem," Han Li replied, calming the Flame Boy.

The auction list had many materials with rich fire-type yuan force, and they were not expensive, so buying some would be fine.

Xiao Bai was also in the Flower Branch Space, shouting and making a ruckus, but he wasn't asking Han Li to buy him any treasures, rather, he wanted to come out and watch the auction.
Han Li reluctantly extended a strand of his divine sense into the flower branch space, projecting the scene of the auction hall outside.

Just then, a loud, resonant sound echoed through the hall, signaling the official start of the auction.

On the auction stage, a flash of red light appeared, and a stout, elderly man with a wide face and large ears materialized out of thin air.

Han Li's gaze flickered, and he noticed that despite the old man's unassuming appearance, he was actually a mid-stage Da Luo cultivator, serving as the auctioneer.

"Welcome, esteemed guests, to the Golden Origin Sect's once-in-a-millennium Treasure Gathering Festival! We're honored to have you here at the Day and Night Pavilion. We hope you'll find something that suits your tastes and leave with a treasured item. Without further ado, let's begin the auction of our first treasure!"

The stout old man bowed, and several blue-robed attendants carried a jade box onto the stage.

Inside the box lay a yellow crystal the size of a grinding stone, surrounded by swirling, earthy auras. A dense, earthy law fluctuation emanated from the crystal, affecting the gravity in the surrounding area, making it several thousand times heavier. The attendants struggled to lift the box.

"Please behold, this Earth Emperor Crystal hails from the Wu Tu Sect, born from the depths of the earth, where it absorbed the essence of the land for billions of years. Its material is incredibly hard, and it contains an abundance of magnetic, earthy law fluctuations, making it more than sufficient for crafting a fourth-grade, earth-attribute treasure. The starting price is five million spirit stones, and each bid must be at least one hundred thousand."

The old man's words were straightforward, yet they conveyed a sense of reliability.

As soon as he finished speaking, the hall erupted into a flurry of discussion, with many attendees displaying excitement.

Han Li's eyes widened as he gazed at the Earth Emperor Crystal.

Although he had seen the crystal on the jade slip, he was still impressed by its grandeur.

The Earth Emperor Crystal was considered the pinnacle of earth-attribute materials, rivaling the Heaven's Gold Drill in its quality. It was the most coveted treasure among cultivators who practiced earth-attribute laws.

Moreover, the crystal could be used to craft a fourth-grade treasure.

In the realm of treasure grades, fourth-grade was a critical threshold.

While fifth-grade treasures were not rare, they were still relatively uncommon. Typically, only high-ranking cultivators who had reached the Da Luo stage could acquire one, either through effort or financial means. With sufficient materials and time, they could refine their treasure to the fifth grade.

Han Li's own sword, the Qingtian Bee Cloud Sword, was a testament to this. Its foundation was solid, and with the aid of the Five Lights Thunder Sea and the cultivation methods from the Five Thunder True Scripture, it had become a fifth-grade treasure.

However, fourth-grade treasures were a different story altogether. Crafting one required materials of the highest quality, as well as extraordinary technical skill, bordering on the divine. It was said that even after successful creation, the treasure would still face a trial by fire.

Han Li wasn't entirely familiar with the specifics, but he knew that a fourth-grade treasure's power was unmatched, capable of shaking the heavens and destroying the earth.

In the True Immortal Realm, fourth-grade treasures were extremely rare, even among high-ranking cultivators.

The Earth Emperor Crystal, with its exceptional quality, was a treasure of unparalleled value.

Han Li's eyes sparkled as he gazed at the crystal.

Indeed, the Treasure Gathering Festival lived up to its reputation, with the first auction item being such a precious treasure.

Although Han Li didn't need the crystal, he didn't bid on it.

However, many cultivators in the hall were eager to acquire the treasure, and the bidding quickly surpassed ten million spirit stones. In the end, a cultivator from the VIP section won the auction with a bid of twelve million spirit stones.

"Next, we have a Fire Dao Dan, a fifth-grade treasure..."

The stout old man continued to introduce the next auction item.

The Treasure Gathering Festival was indeed a spectacle, with one extraordinary treasure after another appearing on the stage, captivating the audience and pushing the atmosphere to new heights.

Although the prices were exorbitant, many cultivators were willing to pay for the treasures they desired, as these items were truly rare and hard to come by.

As the auction continued, Han Li remained seated, observing the proceedings without participating.

"Next, we have a fifth-grade treasure, the Ghostly Shadow Claw, crafted from the claw of a Da Luo-stage Ghostly Shadow Beast from the Ming Hai Sect. It has been infused with numerous malevolent spirits, eighteen types of ghostly blood, and thirty-six types of ghostly energy. After being refined in the Ghostly Shadow Fire for a hundred million years, it has become a treasure with immense, shadowy law fluctuations, boasting extraordinary piercing and corrosive abilities."

The stout old man revealed the next treasure, a massive, black claw with nine fingers, each finger adorned with fleshy, webbed skin. The claw emitted a cacophony of ghostly wails, as if it were a demonic hand.

The audience gasped in awe, and the atmosphere in the hall became even more electric.
