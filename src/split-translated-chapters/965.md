"Good, good! Er Mou has seen it today, a mere human cultivator with over two hundred acupoints, if you were outside the array, I would have killed you with a single finger, now you dare to be so arrogant in front of me! Er Mou will take a look, how you can live up to your reputation!"

Upon hearing this, Er Weng suddenly burst out laughing.

He then repeated the hand seal, violently pressing down on his brow, and several strange symbol marks appeared on his brow, similar to the ones before. The blood energy around him surged like a wave, and the flesh and blood energy that had flowed out of his body began to return.

Han Li, however, ignored Er Weng and stepped forward in a steady pace, continuously gesturing the hand seals as he danced within the "Blood Cocoon".

Suddenly, a white light emerged from above the "Blood Cocoon", and the cocoon's surface began to crack, splitting open like a blooming flower, transforming into a nine-layered "Blood Lotus".

Han Li clapped his hands in a seal, and sat down cross-legged as the "Blood Lotus" below him bloomed, radiating a deep red light and unleashing an extremely powerful attractive force.

The flesh and blood energy that Er Weng had previously intercepted and was absorbing, suddenly surged out of his body once more, transforming into a dragon-like shape, and violently pounced towards Han Li, plunging into the nine-layered "Blood Lotus".

Han Li's eyes widened as he let out a deafening roar, the veins on his forehead bulging like earthworms as he obtained the doubled power, but the pain he endured also intensified several times.

The top of the "Blood Lotus" beneath him lit up with countless dense bloody lights, resembling numerous sharp blood knives, piercing into his body and injecting the energy of the refined power into his body.

A series of explosions sounded out, as seven or eight more acupoints on Han Li's body lit up.

Er Weng's expression changed, and he finally realized the situation was more severe than he had imagined.

At this moment, not only was the flesh and blood energy within the entire Large Array flowing towards Han Li through his body, but the power that Er Weng had accumulated within himself was also showing signs of being drained.

A flash of furious anger crossed Er Weng's eyes, his hand seal changed, and two gashes appeared on his palms, blood flowing out, dyeing his entire hand red.

Using his blood-stained hands, he pressed down on the five-pointed star below him, quickly reciting an incantation.

The five-pointed star radiated intense light, unleashing a powerful attractive force that intercepted the flesh and blood energy flowing into Han Li's body, as he and Han Li engaged in a tug-of-war.

"You, Er City Master, are quite formidable outside the array, I must say you're the strongest Xian cultivator I've seen, but don't you still not see the situation clearly? This Large Array I am more familiar with, in the array, you are no match for me," Han Li sneered, taking a deep breath, as his hand seal changed once again.

The nine-layered "Blood Lotus" beneath him surfaced with strange symbol marks, the attractive force emanating from it surged several times.

With a loud crash, the blood light on the five-pointed star beneath Er Weng shattered.

He could no longer resist Han Li, and could only watch as the powers he had coveted for years flowed towards Han Li.

Soft crackling sounds accompanied the white virtual light on Er Weng's body extinguishing, one by one.

In just a short span of ten breaths, only over a thousand of his fully materialized acupoints remained.

The flesh and blood energy that Er Weng had thought he had fully absorbed also began to drain away.

Judging from the current situation, it wouldn't take long before he would also become like Sun Tu and the others, a mere filter for the Blood Array's energy to aid Han Li.

Er Weng hesitated for a long time before gritting his teeth, his hand seal changing as he struck the top of the statue below him.

"Don't be in a hurry to leave, Er City Master, I still need you to stay in the array for a bit," Han Li sneered, his hands rapidly moving in a seal as he pointed towards the void.

Suddenly, a massive amount of blood light erupted from the five-pointed star beneath Er Weng, a seven-petaled "Blood Lotus" burst out, resembling an exotic beast about to devour him.

Er Weng's eyes solidified, he stopped gesturing the hand seal, and instead raised his fist, smashing it onto the five-pointed star below him.

The dense acupoints on his arm lit up one after another, a layer of white stellar light enveloped it, exuding a wave of powerful energy fluctuations.

A deafening boom erupted.

Er Weng's fist smashed onto the "Blood Lotus", the statue beneath him violently shaking, surprisingly not collapsing, as the dazzling white light and the piercing bloody light simultaneously exploded.

A frenzied gale rushed out, colliding with the inner wall of the Blood-Colored Luminous Screen, shaking the entire Large Array.

Outside the array, the crowd on the altar couldn't help but gasp in unison as they watched the scene unfold.

Han Li, suspended in mid-air, was also destabilized by the immense force, and quickly gestured the hand seal to stabilize the entire Large Array.
Chapter:

Just then, E Shi had already activated his incantation again, striking the beast statue beneath him.

The beast statue behind him burst forth with two wings, from which two white lights shot out, splitting apart and tearing open a hole in the blood-red light screen that was only large enough for one person to pass through.

The opening looked unstable, and it started to close as soon as it appeared. E Shi, however, had already flashed forward, crossing through the opening and escaping outside the blood-red light screen.

Moreover, as he exited the formation, he stretched out his hands with a fierce cry, and two white bone chains shot out from his sleeves, instantly piercing the blood cocoon containing Sun Tu and Chen Yang.

The two, who had long since lost their strength to resist, felt a searing pain in their shoulders. The bones had pierced through, and they were pulled out from the blood cocoon by E Shi's sudden tug, flying towards the entrance that was about to close.

Han Li was about to intervene, but he discovered that the blood dragon-like red glow, which had lost its buffer of the three cultivators, was now rushing towards him after passing Qin Yuan and Fu Jian.

The moment the red glow surged into the Nine-Layered Blood Lotus within Han Li, he felt as if someone had punched him in the chest, causing his heart to throb heavily.

Immediately, a power that far surpassed the previous one began to clash wildly in his limbs, causing pain and pressure that threatened to overwhelm him. While the previous power had been like hacking with a blade, this new power was like being pierced by a thousand swords, and Han Li could feel himself losing control at any moment.

Han Li hurriedly calmed his mind, activated his incantation, and attempted to suppress this power.

On the other side, E Shi, who had managed to pull Chen Yang and Sun Tu out of the Blood-Tears Boundary at the last moment, threw them onto the ground. They lay there like two slumping masses of mud, motionless.

The faces of Shi Chuang Kong and the others turned serious, yet none of them dared to approach.

"A mere cultivator with less than three hundred acupoints, you'll see how long you can last without the three of them to share the power of the Blood Array?" E Shi looked at Han Li with a cold smile, not even sparing a glance at the others. "Once you explode and die, your body will become a part of the blood array, and I'll absorb it back into my body. Don't you find that a bit ironic?"

Han Li's eyes had turned blood-red, and his ears felt as if they were being bombarded with thunder. He couldn't even hear E Shi's voice.

With all his strength, Han Li urged the Starlight force in his body to stabilize the Blood-Tears Boundary, which finally calmed down. However, the crazily violent power within the blood array, now that it was no longer being filtered by the three cultivators, was far beyond what Han Li's current body could handle.

At this moment, Han Li's body was making strange noises, and more than ten acupoints in his chest had been pierced through. However, it was strange that the white light emanating from these newly opened acupoints contained a faint, crimson glow.

His body began to swell, and not only did his limbs and torso double in size, but even his skull was expanding rapidly, as if it was about to burst open.

Han Li's brain felt like it was going to explode from the pain, and if not for his exceptionally strong soul, he would have already lost his grip on his sanity.

Yet, it was precisely because he still maintained a shred of clear awareness that he knew his time was almost up. He wouldn't be able to hold on for more than ten breaths, and after a few more moments, his body would rupture.

Han Li wondered if his Nascent Soul could survive and hide in the small bottle.

Not far away, Shi Chuang Kong's face turned ugly, his eyes still fixed intently on Han Li. Liu Xiu Ning had a complex expression, seemingly lost in thought.

Zhu Zijin, however, seemed unwilling to watch Han Li's body explode, so he slightly turned his head away.

"Hah! Overconfident brat, go to your death!" E Shi burst into loud laughter, his voice ringing out.

Yet, just as everyone was expecting the bloody scene to unfold, Han Li's swollen body began to shrink, slowly returning to its normal state.

Han Li clutched his head, letting out a mournful howl as if he were suffering greatly. However, his eyes had regained some of their clarity. Only he knew that, at this moment, the black, bottle-like artifact in his abdomen was unleashing its power, absorbing the frenzied energy that had entered his body like a bottomless void.

The artifact refused none of this power, no matter how much it was fed.

Han Li's current agonized state was merely an act, a ruse to deceive everyone else. Most of the Blood Array's power had been absorbed into the artifact, and he was only allowing a small portion of it to pass into his body.

"How is this possible...? This is impossible... You can't last that long..." E Shi, his face filled with shock and doubt, bellowed in rage.

Not only was he shocked, but even Shi Chuang Kong, who had been preparing to flee, was caught off guard by this sudden turn of events.

"What's going on? Does that kid have some hidden trick?" Liu Xiu Ning exclaimed in surprise.

"Brother, what's happening?" Zhu Zijin asked in confusion.

Zhu Yuanting's brow furrowed, and he shook his head, his gaze shifting to E Shi.

Just then, E Shi vanished from his original position, only to reappear behind Qin Yuan's statue.

"Let's see how long you can last without those two to stabilize the array," E Shi sneered, his lips curling into a cold smile.
