Here is the translated text:

The Ink Dragon Flying Boat quickly left the Eight Desolations Mountain, heading in a certain direction.

Not long after leaving the Eight Desolations Mountain, Han Li took out some spirit puppets to control the flying boat, and also activated several hidden defensive seals on the boat. After making all the arrangements, he brought Xiao Bai to the secret room and entered the Flower Branch Space.

As soon as Han Li entered the space, he used his hand seals to activate the Light Years Heavenly Array and the Jun Tian Day Clock, causing the flow of time within the space to change suddenly.

"Hmm, it feels like something is different here. Did you do something, Master?" Xiao Bai immediately sensed the subtle change in the void and let out a soft exclamation.

"It's just a time difference space, nothing more. The flow of time here is about 50 times faster than outside. You can cultivate here." Han Li said calmly.

"Master, you can even set up such a wonderful space. I didn't know your time law had reached this level!" Xiao Bai exclaimed repeatedly, and then found a place to sit down and cultivate.

Han Li also found a place to sit down, and first took out the Wheel of Reincarnation Mask to check on the task he had previously posted to find the Time Law.

Unfortunately, despite offering a high reward, no one had responded, and there was no news from Jiao San either.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and his eyes flashed with a hint of impatience. He clenched his fists, and the void beside him trembled with a low hum.

He had greatly increased his physical strength, and with the Years God Lamp and the Heaven-Piercing Sword Array, his power was not weak.

But he still had a huge limitation holding him back, and that was his cultivation level, which was still at the peak of the Tai Yi Realm.

If he couldn't advance to the Da Luo Realm, his power would always be limited, and he couldn't fully transcend.

Han Li's eyes suddenly focused on a message that appeared on the transaction interface, and a smile spread across his face. He muttered to himself, "I've been searching for so long, and finally, I have a lead. Let's give it a try."

A moment later, he put away the mask and sat down to continue contemplating the Heaven-Piercing Sword Array, as well as the two divine abilities, "Law of Heaven and Earth" and "Reversal of the True Wheel".

...

Near the northwest border of the Great Golden Source Immortal Domain, the Savage Wilderness Domain was under pressure from the Heavenly Court, and some humans had frequently entered the area for various purposes, causing the many True Spirit tribes to retreat. Only fierce beasts with little spiritual intelligence remained, occupying the area.

The beast cores, blood, and bones of these fierce beasts were precious materials, attracting more and more cultivators to come and search for treasure.

Although the Savage Wilderness Domain was no longer inhabited by the True Spirit tribes, the area was still full of danger. Besides the fierce beasts, the chaotic heavenly energy could also produce various heavenly perils and absolute lands. Even Tai Yi Realm, or even Da Luo Realm cultivators, could fall if they entered.

In a certain area of the Savage Wilderness Domain, the rocks and ground were all black, and the sky was covered with thick, dark clouds. Thick, heavy lightning bolts flashed across the clouds, and the deeper one went, the more intense the lightning became.

At the deepest point, one could see a waterfall-like cascade of lightning, as if the sky itself was collapsing.

The lightning in this area was also multicolored, and the void was filled with a dense, sparkling energy that made one's skin crawl.

This area was known as the Five Lightnings Domain, a famous heavenly peril near the Great Golden Source Immortal Domain.

Near the Five Lightnings Domain, one could occasionally see the silhouettes of cultivators, wearing various defensive artifacts, flying into the domain to pick up some things.

The Five Lightnings Domain was indeed a treacherous place, but the dense lightning energy could also produce various lightning-attribute materials.

The true absolute land, however, was the deepest part of the Five Lightnings Domain. The outer area was not too dangerous, and the lightning that fell from the sky was not too powerful. As long as one was careful and had good luck, they wouldn't be in mortal danger.

Of course, if one's luck was bad, it would be a different story.

In the outer area of the Five Lightnings Domain, three cultivators stood back-to-back, surrounded by over a dozen 100-meter-long purple snakes that were made of purple lightning. The snakes spat out thick, heavy lightning bolts, forming a lightning net that pressed the three cultivators together.

The three cultivators were not weak, with a gray-robed old man at the late Gold Immortal stage, a black-armored ugly man and a red-robed young woman at the mid-Gold Immortal stage. They used their artifacts to resist the snakes' attacks, but if they hadn't cultivated a joint attack technique, connecting their spiritual energy together, they would have been broken through and killed.

"Damn it! Why are there so many lightning beasts in the outer area?" the black-armored ugly man shouted, using a thick, heavy purple demon-subduing staff to resist the snakes' attacks.

In the Five Lightnings Domain, besides the rampant lightning, there was another danger - the lightning beasts born from the domain.
The Thunder Beasts in this place were formed from the essence of lightning in the Five Lights Thunder Domain, and their strength was exceptionally powerful. However, they usually lived deep within the Thunder Domain and rarely came to the outside.

"Zhao Daoist, what's the use of complaining about the current situation? Miao Xianzi, you should still have the Subduing Fire Pearl, use it to break through the Thunder Net, we'll make a last-ditch effort. If we delay any further, we'll all fall here." The old man in gray robes, sweating profusely, urged the red-robed woman while operating a golden cauldron artifact, which shot out golden rays of light to protect himself.

"The Subduing Fire Pearl only has one last piece left, and we've tried it before. Although it can break through the Thunder Net and temporarily get us out of trouble, it can't heavily damage these Thunder Snakes. Their speed is much faster than ours, and we can't escape in the end!" The red-robed woman, with three red fire flags floating above her head, spewed out dragon-shaped flames to block the incoming lightning, and hesitated.

"Don't worry, I have a Void Sealing Immortal Talisman, which can restrain these Thunder Snakes for a short period. I didn't use it earlier because we were deeper in the Five Lights Thunder Domain. Now that we're at the edge of the domain, we can try to escape. As long as we can stall for a moment, we'll be safe." The old man in gray robes said urgently.

"Sun Daoist, you should have said so earlier! Alright, I'll cast the spell." The red-robed woman was overjoyed, and with a flip of her hand, a fist-sized red sphere appeared in her hand.

The sphere was covered in flame-shaped patterns and emitted intense fire law fluctuations.

But the black-armored man's brow furrowed, and he was about to say something.

"Go!" The red-robed woman had already shouted, and the red sphere transformed into a red light that shot out and hit the purple Thunder Net.

A deafening crash shook the heavens.

A massive, million-zhang-wide red sun burst forth, and a sea of red light surged outward, engulfing everything.

The purple Thunder Net was shattered by the red sun, and the two nearby Thunder Snakes were swept away by the flames.

However, the other Thunder Snakes didn't retreat; instead, they charged toward the trio in a frenzy.

The old man in gray robes took out a white talisman, which was inscribed with silver spiritual patterns, and it looked exceptionally mysterious.

He spat out a mouthful of essence blood, which merged with the talisman, and then crushed it.

The talisman transformed into a silver light that flashed and disappeared into the void.

The surrounding void suddenly trembled, and countless silver threads shot out, binding the Thunder Snakes.

The Thunder Snakes were immobilized, unable to move.

However, the black-armored man and the red-robed woman were also bound by the silver threads, unable to move.

Only the old man in gray robes was enveloped in a layer of light, and the silver threads passed through him as if he had become a shadow.

"Sun Zhongshan, what do you mean by this?" The black-armored man and the red-robed woman were enraged.

"Both of you, this Void Sealing Immortal Talisman will restrain everyone nearby, including the caster. I'm powerless to stop it, and I can only apologize to you both!" The old man in gray robes flashed a hint of regret, bowed slightly, and transformed into a silver rainbow that shot into the distance, disappearing into the horizon.

The black-armored man and the red-robed woman were furious, but they could only watch as the old man escaped, powerless to stop him. At this moment, the Thunder Snakes let out angry roars and struggled fiercely.

The silver threads began to quiver, showing signs of breaking.

The black-armored man and the red-robed woman saw this and, despite their anger, frantically struggled to break free, hoping to escape before the Thunder Snakes did. Perhaps they still had a chance.

However, the surrounding silver threads were incredibly resilient, and the duo's spiritual energy was almost depleted. No matter how hard they struggled, they couldn't escape.

On the other hand, the Thunder Snakes' bodies glowed with lightning, and the surrounding lightning energy surged toward them, making them stronger. The silver threads began to break, and the Thunder Snakes were about to break free.

The black-armored man and the red-robed woman's faces turned pale, and their eyes filled with despair.

Just then, a deafening crash shook the heavens, and a massive, earth-shattering sound wave erupted from the depths of the Thunder Domain, piercing the sky and shaking the clouds.

The sound wave transformed into a heavenly sword cry, and seventy-two golden sword lights burst forth from the depths of the Thunder Domain, flying through the lightning like seventy-two dragons.

Each sword light emitted an intense, unmatched sword intent and lightning law fluctuations, devouring the lightning wherever they went.

Although the seventy-two sword lights were still far away from the black-armored man and the red-robed woman, separated by countless lightning bolts, the sword intent and law fluctuations still seemed to transmit clearly, like a tidal wave.

The black-armored man and the red-robed woman looked at each other, their eyes filled with a glimmer of hope.
