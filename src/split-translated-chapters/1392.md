After an unknown amount of time, the last burst of golden light shot out from Han Li's palm, and the intense golden light that had been fluctuating wildly around his body suddenly dissipated.

As his aura plummeted, his cultivation also dropped to the peak of the Great Luo Realm.

"Thank you, Senior Bottle Spirit, for your assistance," Han Li took a deep breath and released his grip on the Heaven's Hand Bottle.

The Bottle Spirit didn't respond to his words.

At this moment, the Heaven's Hand Bottle suddenly trembled, and the golden light on its surface flashed wildly. The dark green light inside the bottle also jumped wildly.

Han Li's face changed, and he quickly retreated, releasing a golden light ring from his body to resist the surrounding space-time forces.

With a loud "boom," the Heaven's Hand Bottle exploded, turning into countless dark green light orbs that slowly dispersed.

These dark green light orbs didn't disperse, instead gathering together to form a person. In a short time, they condensed into an eight-year-old green-haired child with a clear and elegant face, but whose sex couldn't be discerned.

"Haha, after so many years, I've finally escaped that accursed bottle and regained my freedom!" The green-haired child looked at its body and laughed loudly.

"Senior Bottle Spirit, congratulations on finally breaking free from the Heaven's Hand Bottle's constraints," Han Li said calmly, as if he had long anticipated this.

"Ah, you knew about this?" The Bottle Spirit was somewhat surprised by Han Li's reaction.

"Senior Bottle Spirit, as the spirit of the Heaven's Hand Bottle, you were often silent and focused on your cultivation. I guessed that you had ulterior motives. Moreover, my Cultivation of the Spirit technique is complete, and I'm extremely sensitive to mental connections. Although you're not a living being, I could still sense your thoughts when we communicated, so I roughly guessed some things," Han Li said with a faint smile.

"Ah, the master of the Reincarnation Hall is indeed a genius, creating such a powerful Cultivation of the Spirit technique. You sensed my intentions, yet you still dared to cooperate with me?" The Bottle Spirit smiled and glanced at Han Li, saying.

"Senior Bottle Spirit, although you had ulterior motives, I didn't sense any malice. It was a mutually beneficial cooperation, so why would I be afraid? Besides, although my current realm has dropped back to the Great Luo Realm, my understanding of the time laws hasn't weakened. I'm not someone who can be easily manipulated," Han Li said with a faint smile.

"Haha, good! You're indeed Han Li. Although you've returned to the peak of the Great Luo Realm, you should still be cautious when using the time laws... Moreover, you can rest assured that I have no ill intentions towards you. I'm grateful that you abandoned the Dao Ancestor's power, allowing me to smoothly escape the Heaven's Hand Bottle," the Bottle Spirit said, laughing again, and bowed to Han Li.

"We simply helped each other, Senior Bottle Spirit. There's no need to be so polite. What are your plans now?" Han Li raised his arm, returned the courtesy, and asked.

"After being trapped in the bottle for countless years, I naturally want to explore the True Immortal Realm. If I have the chance, I'd like to take a look at the world beyond the True Immortal Realm," the Bottle Spirit said, its face filled with excitement.

"The world beyond the True Immortal Realm? Are you referring to the Underworld and the Gray Realm?" Han Li's eyes widened slightly.

"Ah, Han Dao friend, your vision is a bit narrow. Don't you think that the True Immortal Realm, the Underworld, and the Gray Realm are the entirety of the world?" The Bottle Spirit smiled, its expression becoming more serious.

"The True Immortal Realm's various immortal domains were opened up within the boundless Wilderness Realm. Therefore, the Wilderness Realm's area should be larger than the True Immortal Realm's known territory. As for what lies beyond the Wilderness Realm, I don't know," Han Li said thoughtfully.

"Ah, Han Dao friend, your perspective is still insufficient. To be accurate, the True Immortal Realm, the Underworld, and the Gray Realm were all born from the initial Chaos Space. The Heaven's Hand Bottle was also born from there. According to the Heaven's Hand Bottle's original memories, the Chaos Space is boundless, and it's unknown how many realms similar to the True Immortal Realm were born. However, it's definitely not just two or three. How about it, Han Dao friend? Are you interested in exploring the world's end with me?" The Bottle Spirit looked at Han Li.

"Senior Bottle Spirit, you have a lofty ambition. I admire that. However, I've just gone through a great calamity, and my mind is truly exhausted. Moreover, there are people waiting for me to return, so I'm afraid I won't be able to accompany you on this journey," Han Li's eyes sparkled, but he shook his head.

"Alright, people have different ambitions. I won't force you," the Bottle Spirit said, its tone slightly disappointed.

"Senior Bottle Spirit, we're currently in a space-time tunnel, and we no longer have the Heaven's Hand Bottle. How will we return?" Han Li didn't want to discuss this topic further, so he changed the subject.

"Don't worry, I'm the Bottle Spirit of the Heaven's Hand Bottle. I can do what the Heaven's Hand Bottle could do. At least, I can bring you back without any issues. However, Han Dao friend, if I'm not mistaken, you should still have some regrets. Otherwise, you wouldn't have hesitated so long when choosing whether to abandon the Heaven's Hand Bottle," the Bottle Spirit said, looking at Han Li.

Han Li's mind involuntarily conjured up the image of Mu Yao's enchanting figure.

The Bottle Spirit smiled, gazing at Han Li without speaking.

"Senior Bottle Spirit, you're right. I do have a regret. I wonder if you could help me with one more thing?" Han Li sighed and bowed deeply to the Bottle Spirit.

"Ah, the emotions of you humans are indeed strange. What's there to be attached to in love? Death is just a cycle, and enlightenment is just a matter of time. Alright, I'll help you fulfill your wish. However, I won't be involved in your affairs," the Bottle Spirit said, its eyes gleaming with a strange light.

As soon as the Bottle Spirit finished speaking, its hands clasped together, and a layer of emerald green light enveloped them. The light rapidly intensified, merging together.

The emerald green light came and went quickly, dissipating soon after.

The Bottle Spirit opened its hands, and a thumb-sized transparent bottle appeared in its palm. The bottle was very similar to the Heaven's Hand Bottle, and the aura it emitted was also similar.

"This is the last bit of the Heaven's Hand Bottle's power. You can use it as a temporary Heaven's Hand Bottle. Use this item to return to the past and handle your affairs," the Bottle Spirit said, tossing the transparent bottle to Han Li.

"Thank you, Senior Bottle Spirit," Han Li's eyes flashed with a hint of joy.

"With your current mastery of the time laws, you should be able to accurately find the past time point. However, this item's power is limited, and you won't be able to stay in the past for too long. So, you should act quickly," the Bottle Spirit said, its expression serious.
I know, thank you, Senior. Han Li nodded, bowing his head again to Xie.

Alright, Han Dao Friend, I've repaid your kindness, let's part ways here, and from now on, we'll be separated by mountains and rivers, with no chance of meeting again. The Bottle Spirit waved goodbye to Han Li, and with a flash of his body, he flew away into the distance.

Han Li was about to wave goodbye, but the Bottle Spirit seemed unable to stay for even a moment, and with a blink of an eye, he disappeared from view.

Han Li's hand, still raised in farewell, froze in mid-air, and he couldn't help but rub his nose in self-deprecation.

Then, he turned his gaze to the transparent small bottle in his hand, and after a moment of contemplation, he pinched a seal and pointed.

A golden light shot out from his fingertip, entering the bottle.

The surface of the transparent small bottle immediately produced a layer of green mist, and faintly, a series of symbols began to flash on its surface. The surrounding time force began to fluctuate, as if controlled by the power emanating from the bottle.

Han Li closed his eyes, silently sensing the transparent small bottle and the fluctuations in the surrounding time force. It was a familiar yet unfamiliar feeling.

A moment later, he suddenly opened his eyes, and with a single hand, he pinched another seal.

The green mist on the small bottle suddenly intensified, enveloping Han Li's body and propelling him forward into the depths of the time-space tunnel.

As he flew through the tunnel, surrounded by the light of the small bottle, Han Li felt no effects from the tunnel's distortions, and his speed was extremely fast.

However, the small bottle's originally semi-transparent walls were gradually becoming more transparent.

Han Li's heart tightened, and he quickly calmed his mind, focusing more intently on controlling the bottle.

After flying for about half a quarter of an hour, he gazed intently forward.

"About... it should be here." Han Li muttered to himself, raising his hand to wave.

A dark green light shot out from his fingertip, slashing through the time-space tunnel.

"Rip!" The tunnel was suddenly torn apart, revealing a blinding white light that exploded forth.

Han Li felt himself being flung out of the tunnel, and as he opened his eyes, he found himself above a vast desert.

Rumble!

The nearby void violently trembled, unable to withstand Han Li's powerful aura, and large areas began to collapse.

He hastily employed the Wan Kui Xuan Jing technique, using all his might to restrain his breath and the surging law force within his body.

Han Li's eyebrows twitched, and he realized that although his cultivation had retreated to the peak of the Great Luo stage, his control over the time laws within his body had become more refined, and his breath was more stable.

The nearby void ceased its collapse, but continued to violently fluctuate like the surface of water.

Han Li didn't bother with this, and instead expanded his divine sense.

Immediately after, he furrowed his brow, and inwardly exclaimed, "Bad, the spatial force control isn't quite right! This isn't the Spiritual Realm!"

Without the Bottle Spirit's assistance, Han Li was unable to fully control the transparent small bottle, and he had been transported to this unknown location. However, he shouldn't have deviated too far.

This place was an unfamiliar realm, filled with yellow sand, and he had no idea where it was.

Han Li's hand still held the small bottle, and although it wasn't being activated, he could clearly sense the power it contained, slowly flowing away.

His heart felt a sense of urgency, and he quickly pinched a seal. A golden light flashed on his body, and he vanished into thin air, reappearing in a massive sandcastle-shaped structure.

 Inside, he found numerous alien cultivators with horns on their heads and scales on their bodies.

Han Li's surroundings continued to fluctuate, causing the sandcastle to shake violently.

The alien cultivators were shocked, and several high-level cultivators, who had reached the fusion stage, immediately roared in anger and pounced towards Han Li. However, they were unable to get close.

Han Li had no time to waste, and with a wave of his hand, he seized one of the highest-level alien cultivators and employed the Soul Search technique.

"Ah, I see, this is the Yellow Sand Realm, and it's not far from the Spiritual Realm. Luckily, I didn't deviate too much." Han Li's heart relaxed, and with a flick of his wrist, he discarded the alien cultivator. His body flashed with golden light, and he vanished once more.

The alien cultivators within the sandcastle exchanged bewildered glances, and the events that had transpired in the blink of an eye seemed like a dream.

The alien cultivator who had been seized by Han Li felt as though he had walked along the edge of death, and although his body seemed unharmed, he was left with a lingering sense of fear, and his body trembled uncontrollably.
