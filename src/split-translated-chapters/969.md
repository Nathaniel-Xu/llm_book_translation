Chapter:

Sun Tu and Duan Tong faced the White Wolf Puppet's huge, bloodthirsty maw. They quickly retreated, attempting to dodge the attack.

Unexpectedly, the giant white wolf's body, despite its massive size, was incredibly agile and quick. Duan Tong's vision blurred as a massive, grinding wheel-sized paw appeared out of thin air and swung down at him.

Duan Tong's face contorted in shock, but since he was still mid-air, he couldn't dodge. Instead, he swung his thick right arm down, summoning the power of the Stellar Void. A blinding white light beam formed and collided with the paw.

A loud cracking sound echoed as Duan Tong's invincible right arm was directly twisted and broken. Like a straw, he was blown backward and crashed to the ground, spewing blood from his mouth.

The White Wolf Puppet also stumbled backward, but quickly regained its balance. Its jaws opened wide once more, unleashing a ferocious howl at Duan Tong.

A burst of white light flashed from the puppet's mouth as its entire head shook violently, emitting a low rumble. Countless white flying needles shot out of its mouth, screaming with an otherworldly howl as they pummeled Duan Tong's body and the surrounding ground.

The needles contained massive power, causing the ground within a several-meter radius to collapse.

Duan Tong was buried, his body riddled with holes from the flying needles. He didn't even have time to scream before meeting his demise.

Sun Tu witnessed the entire scene, his face pale with fear. He turned to flee.

Just then, the bald-headed man appeared above him, riding the Silver Leopard Puppet. The puppet's massive paws swung down.

Sun Tu had just seen the White Wolf Puppet easily kill Duan Tong, and he didn't dare resist. A white glow emanated from his legs as he dodged to the side, barely avoiding the Silver Leopard Puppet's attack.

At that moment, the White Wolf Puppet's jaws opened wide once more, its mouth glowing with white energy as it unleashed another barrage of flying needles.

Sun Tu let out a low growl, and a black glow flashed in his hand. A slender black bone sword appeared, and he swung it upward to counter the flying needles.

The black sword emitted a bright black aura, transforming into a black beast that resembled a mountain cat. It opened its mouth, inhaling the flying needles.

A black glow enveloped the needles, and they vanished into thin air. The black beast dissipated, and the black sword's glow dimmed significantly.

Sun Tu flipped his palm, revealing a white crystal grain. He inserted it into a groove on the sword's hilt, and the crystal's glow flashed before disappearing. The black sword's glow immediately returned to its original state.

Zhuo Ge's eyes widened in surprise. However, his movements didn't slow, and his fingers danced with speed.

The White Wolf Puppet's four legs moved, and its massive body became a white blur as it charged toward Sun Tu. Its speed was astonishing, at least twice as fast as the Silver Leopard Puppet. The puppet's paws carried a devastating wind as they swung down.

Sun Tu didn't flinch, and a white glow emanated from his legs as he dodged the attack once more.

The White Wolf Puppet missed its mark, but its body continued forward, colliding with Sun Tu. He stumbled, barely avoiding the impact.

The puppet's body glowed with white light as it rapidly turned its head and snapped its jaws shut, its speed increasing with each passing moment.

Sun Tu stumbled backward, his footwork erratic as he dodged the attack once more.

As the master of White Rock Castle, Sun Tu's power was far superior to that of Duan Tong. Despite his injuries, he managed to evade the White Wolf Puppet's relentless attacks.

The puppet's body erupted with a furious howl as it continued its assault, unleashing a flurry of attacks with its paws, teeth, and claws.

Although it no longer had the flying needles, the White Wolf Puppet's speed continued to increase, its body becoming a white blur as it pursued Sun Tu.

The other bald-headed man simply watched from a distance, not intervening.

Zhuo Ge's "Lonely Wind Phantom Wolf" was an exceptional puppet from the Puppet City, capable of handling a wounded Sun Tu with ease. Moreover, Zhuo Ge believed that intervening would only hinder the puppet's performance.

As the White Wolf Puppet's attack speed increased, it suddenly swung its paw down.

Sun Tu attempted to dodge, but the puppet's angle and speed were too great. Just as the paw was about to strike, he let out a loud roar and swung his black sword upward.

The sword emitted a massive black glow, transforming into the mountain cat beast once more. The beast bit down on the White Wolf Puppet's paw, and it instantly dissolved into nothingness.

The black beast dissipated, returning to the sword.
Just as this happened, the white wolf puppet flipped its body, and its other front paw flashed by like lightning, seemingly calculating the exact moment and angle of the leopard beast's virtual image appearing, and as the beast's image quickly retreated and vanished, the paw swiftly crossed over and grasped the front of Sun Tu's chest.

Blood suddenly burst forth!

Sun Tu was instantly sent flying, and his chest was slashed open with several long and deep wounds, with blood rapidly gushing out. His body fell to the ground with a loud thud.

Before he could get up, a sharp whistling sound cut through the air, and a short spear flew in, penetrating Sun Tu's dantian and pinning his body to the ground.

Sun Tu struggled a couple of times before completely ceasing to move.

"Duke Xiao's puppet control technique has advanced even further! It seems that in Puppet City, apart from the castle lord, no one remembers you, impressive." The bald man came over with his silver leopard puppet, laughing.

"Great Black Brother is overpraising, if we talk about puppet control technique, not even Wu Yun Duke or Kun Yu Duke are below me, and the newly-arrived young Miss Zi has exceptional talent, even the castle lord has praised her with her technique advancing these years under my personal guidance, I dare not claim to be the first." Zhuo Ge smiled lightly and said.

While speaking, he leaped off and landed beside Sun Tu's body, retrieving the short spear with one hand.

His gaze then shifted towards the black bone sword nearby, which he picked up and examined for a moment, his eyes slightly lighting up, and a hint of a smile appearing on his lips.

Zhuo Ge reached into Sun Tu's robes and searched around, pulling out several things before quickly returning to the white wolf puppet.

Great Black did not say anything, watching Zhuo Ge's actions.

Sun Tu's belongings naturally belonged to Zhuo Ge, the one who had struck him down.

The two then turned their heads towards Wu Yun and Chenyang's direction, finding them entangled in an intense battle.

Zhuo Ge's expression sank, urging the white wolf puppet to rush over, and it quickly arrived at Chenyang and Xuan Yuan Hang's location.

"Chenyang friend, why aren't you two intervening?" Zhuo Ge asked sternly.

"Huh, what's going on with these two?" Great Black followed over, muttering in puzzlement.

Zhuo Ge heard him, glancing over at Chenyang's and Xuan Yuan Hang's empty, dull expressions before leaping off the puppet.

"What's wrong with you two?" Zhuo Ge asked, shaking them.

"Looks like their spiritual souls are being restrained," Great Black observed their expressions and replied.

"It's seems so, but who did it, is it related to the blood array?" Zhuo Ge wondered aloud, suddenly looking towards Han Li and Fu Jian within the blood array.

The blood sac surrounding Han Li grew increasingly thick, making it impossible to see inside, and only faint rumbling sounds could be heard from within.

"No matter what, this blood array can't continue!" A gleam of cold determination flashed in Zhuo Ge's eyes as he hopped back on the white wolf puppet.

"Hsss!" The white wolf puppet radiated intense white light from its body as Zhuo Ge gestured, gathering the light into its front paw.

"Open!" His face turned serious as his hands moved quickly.

The white wolf puppet leaped into the air, its paw slashing downward.

Five half-moon shaped white lights appeared, rapidly expanding to several dozen zhang in size, unearthing eye-searing brilliance that no one could gaze directly at.

The white lights radiated a severe cutting momentum as they traversed the air, evoking cries from everyone watching.

Wu Yun and company, in the midst of battle, sensed the sudden activation in their surroundings, momentarily faltering before turning to gaze towards the blood array.

The five white lights approached the blood array, suddenly rushing down with extreme speed.

Right then, the blood array display fluctuated, a multitude of crimson array patterns flashing in, followed by a layer of intense crystalline bloodlight that fortified the light screen. It emitted a piercing flash of energy aimed towards the five lights.

The sound of crashing thunder boomed, echoing throughout the hall.

The red and white lights intertwined, bursting in all directions with enormous force, the throne chamber bursting into a violent quake, countless shattered stones falling and cracks in the walls deepening.

The shaking of the chamber slowly subsided, with the fading red and white lights eventually disclosing the unscathed blood array display.

Upon witnessing the scene, Zhuo Ge's face instantly fell.

"Looks like Chenyang and company's predicament is the result of someone inside's actions. Duke Xiao, I'll lend you a hand, and together we can take down this constraint!" Great Black enthusiastically called out.

"I'll join in too!"
