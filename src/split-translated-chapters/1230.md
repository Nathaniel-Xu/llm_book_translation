"It's not just that he's not a ordinary person, he also has a huge..."

Feng Tianxian said this, suddenly realizing he was getting a bit too proud and almost let something slip, quickly swallowing back the words "secret".

"What does the Xian Shi plan to do with this person?" Lu Chuanfeng saw this, didn't pry into the matter, and just smiled, saying.

"Lu Gong Zhu, first lock him up and imprison him, wait for me to report to the Heavenly Court, then make a decision. After this matter, you and I will have established a great merit, and there will definitely be a rich reward." Feng Tianxian said with a smile.

Lu Chuanfeng heard this, his face didn't show any unusual expression, but in his heart, he was secretly unhappy.

Capturing Han Li was clearly his own doing, how did this Xian Shi suddenly make it seem like they both shared the merit?

If he were to report it to the Heavenly Court, he feared that most of the merit would fall to him.

"Please help me protect the law, I want to use the Soul Disk to directly report to the Heavenly Court, during the spellcasting, it's crucial not to be interrupted." Feng Tianxian said, naturally unaware of Lu Chuanfeng's dissatisfaction.

"Xian Shi, please cast the spell, I'll take care of things here." Lu Chuanfeng nodded and said.

Feng Tianxian heard this, didn't care about his own heavy injuries, and immediately sat down cross-legged, his hand moving to take out a white jade disk the size of a plate, holding it in front of him.

Only to see his hands form a seal, and his fingers point at the white jade disk, a virtual point in the air.

The white jade disk floated up, suspended in front of him, the ring-shaped talisman on its surface lit up layer by layer, a series of independent talismans appeared, rapidly rotating along the ring-shaped talisman's trajectory.

Feng Tianxian saw this, his eyes closed, and a series of chanting sounds came from his mouth.

At the same time, a circle of white crystal light appeared around his body, a ring-shaped talisman appeared on his forehead, and a white light shot out, projecting onto the Soul Disk.

The Soul Disk trembled slightly, and a wave of light ripples spread out from it.

Just then, Han Li, who had been frozen into an ice sculpture, suddenly had his white light retract, and a dark red light reappeared, a powerful bloodline energy burst forth.

In a situation where several attempts had failed, Han Li activated the true spirit bloodline in his body, combining it with the Tian Sha Zhen Yu Gong, his body began to change, transforming into a three-headed six-armed divine demon shape.

However, under the extreme cold of the ice attribute law, this transformation process became extremely slow and couldn't be completed in one go.

Han Li let out a loud roar in his heart, directly abandoning the protection of his heart and viscera, allowing the Jing Huo Fire Bird to exit his body, melting the layer of extreme cold ice, helping the bloodline energy to fully exert itself.

"Ah, at this time, don't cause trouble for me." Seeing that the transformation was about to be completed, Lu Chuanfeng sighed and said.

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his sleeve and swung it, a blue talisman suddenly flew out from his sleeve, landing on Han Li's body.

The moment the talisman took effect, Han Li's bloodline energy froze, and his entire body's blood flow stopped, the true spirit bloodline in his body naturally unable to continue circulating, all his efforts were in vain.

Just as Han Li was about to be delayed, Lu Chuanfeng looked at Feng Tianxian and saw that the white jade Soul Disk in front of him was trembling, a blurry figure was beginning to take shape, almost forming.

Just then, a sudden change occurred!

Only to see Lu Chuanfeng make a swift motion, a drop of blood flew out from his palm, forming a blood talisman on the center of his palm, which then slapped down onto Feng Tianxian's head.

A blue light pillar shot out from his palm, instantly pouring into Feng Tianxian's body, making a faint "puff" sound, and then disappeared.

Feng Tianxian was suddenly struck, his eyes snapped open, and his pupils were surrounded by bloodshot eyes, but strangely, the bloodshot eyes were not crimson, but deep blue.

His lips parted, and his throat moved, but he couldn't make a sound, only a blue mist flowed out from his mouth.

The next instant, his entire body turned into blue ice crystals from the inside out, and the white jade Soul Disk in front of him also shattered into ice shards.

"Xian Shi, I'm sorry." Lu Chuanfeng let out a sigh and said slowly.

After speaking, he waved his sleeve, a gust of wind swept over, and Feng Tianxian's body shattered into pieces, along with his Yuan Shen, turning into a pile of blue crystal powder, scattering all over the ground.

Lu Chuanfeng looked at the storage ring and storage seal that had fallen to the ground, didn't even think about picking them up, and instead, a layer of blue frost covered them, directly crushing them into powder.

Han Li witnessed this scene, and his heart was shocked to the extreme.

If the previous sneak attack by Tian Xing Zun on Feng Tianxian was already shocking enough, then the current situation, where the Palace Master of the Golden Source Xian Palace, Lu Chuanfeng, also attacked a Xian Shi of the Heavenly Court, and did so in a ruthless and efficient manner, was even more astonishing.

What was going on?

Before Han Li could think it through, a series of "bang bang" sounds echoed through the Jiuyuan Pavilion.
The dozen or so ice sculptures standing beside Han Li suddenly shattered one by one, turning into a blue crystalline powder that covered the ground, just like the Phoenix Heavenly Envoy.

In the end, only Han Li was left.

At this moment, Han Li's heart had already frozen to the point of numbness, and he couldn't believe that Lu Chuanfeng had come to rescue him. If that were the case, there would have been no need to freeze him in the first place.

Han Li had always been cautious and considered the worst-case scenario, which was one of the reasons he had been able to survive in the Immortal Realm.

"Bottle Spirit, Bottle Spirit..."

Han Li called out in his mind, but the Bottle Spirit didn't respond, whether it was because he couldn't use his immortal energy or the Time Law, or for some other reason.

Without the Bottle Spirit's help, Han Li was completely unable to escape.

Just as he was about to use some desperate measures to try and escape, a sudden development occurred.

Lu Chuanfeng suddenly raised his hand and waved it, and a blue light descended from above, sweeping past Han Li's body like a whirlwind. The layer of extreme cold ice that had been covering him melted and disappeared in the blue light.

After Han Li regained his freedom, he was still wary and uncertain, but he quickly hid his aura and put away the Flame Bird.

"Hehe, you don't need to be so cautious. In my spiritual domain, there won't be any leakage of aura," Lu Chuanfeng said with a smile.

"You're also from the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall?" Han Li asked, his guard still up.

"Ah, you're as cautious as the rumors say. Indeed, I am from the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall, and I've been hiding in the Heavenly Court for who knows how many years. This time, I've finally been exposed," Lu Chuanfeng laughed.

"This..." Han Li looked around at the ruined hall and hesitated.

"Ask me anything you want to know. There are some things you can know," Lu Chuanfeng said nonchalantly.

"This is the plan of the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall? I don't believe it. The entire Wheel of Reincarnation Hall has been planning for so long, just to assassinate a Heavenly Court Envoy?" Han Li raised an eyebrow.

"Haha... of course not. If it were just to kill such a useless person, it wouldn't be worth exposing my and the Heavenly Star Venerable's identities at the same time. This is just one part of the plan. But the Hall Master said earlier that you don't need to be involved in the rest of the tasks, so you don't need to know," Lu Chuanfeng said with a smile.

Han Li heard this and frowned, wondering why the Hall Master had mentioned him specifically.

But he didn't ask this question out loud, instead saying:

"What about the mess here? The Nine Yuan Observatory will probably discover the situation soon?"

"The aura here hasn't leaked out yet, and I'll erase all the traces of everyone except you. The Nine Yuan Observatory will take some time to figure out what happened. But it's not a problem, it's just as well that they know. Otherwise, this mess would have been for nothing," Lu Chuanfeng said with a raised eyebrow.

He looked completely different from his usual self, without a hint of his usual gentle and warm demeanor. Instead, he seemed carefree and at ease.

After speaking, he tossed something over to Han Li, who caught it and saw that it was a Nine Yuan Observatory inner disciple's token.

"Later, you'll need to change your appearance and can't appear as Chang Qi again," Lu Chuanfeng instructed.

"Thank you, senior," Han Li said with a nod.

"Alright, go take care of your own business," Lu Chuanfeng said with a lazy stretch, as if he had shed his previous disguise and was now more relaxed.

Han Li nodded and, with a wave of his hand, transformed his face into that of a ordinary-looking young man with a long, thin face.

His clothes also changed into a light, gauzy robe.

Han Li hung the token at his waist and bowed to Lu Chuanfeng before turning to leave.

As he walked out of the hall, he saw that the bodies of the Lake Mountain Sect cultivators had been broken into pieces and were being absorbed into Lu Chuanfeng's spiritual domain, erasing all traces of them.

Han Li's eyes flickered slightly, and he still felt a lingering sense of unease.

After he left the Nine Yuan Pavilion, he immediately flashed towards the mountain forest outside.

A moment later, a white rainbow shot up from the Nine Yuan Pavilion, flying towards the sky.

The already damaged hall collapsed with a loud rumbling sound, sending up a massive cloud of dust.
