A thunderous sound!

The white horse's hoof struck the ground, causing the space in front of it to ripple like the surface of water, and then a loud "crack" sounded as a massive spatial rift opened up.

The horse's hoof didn't stop, and it directly pierced through the rift, landing heavily on the tip of the illusory giant sword.

A thunderous sound shook the heavens!

The white horse's hoof and the illusory giant sword collided, causing a massive shockwave that rippled through the air, and the entire void trembled. Cracks appeared in the surrounding space, flashing and disappearing in a rapid succession.

The horse's hoof was pierced and shattered by the illusory giant sword, but the sword itself also shattered into countless golden threads that scattered in all directions.

The white wind column was affected by the shockwave, causing it to violently shake and develop cracks.

However, the horse's hoof was shattered, and the over 100 law threads that had been hidden within emerged, unscathed and shining brightly.

The law threads moved, seeking to converge with the white wind column.

At that moment, two blue spirit domains appeared out of thin air, enveloping everything within.

As the spirit domains appeared, a massive blue ice sword and a blue fist the size of a small mountain appeared beside the white wind column, striking it simultaneously.

The white wind column shook violently, its cracks expanding, but it did not shatter.

"Ha ha, you two think you can hide and sneak up on me? You think you can break my divine ability? Come out and face me!" a sharp voice laughed maniacally, as the white spirit domain's light churned and condensed into a massive white hand that reached out to grab something.

A thunderous sound echoed through the air!

The area where the hand grasped suddenly erupted in a blinding blue light, and two figures stumbled out, revealing Su Zhen and Jing Liu, who were caught by the white hand.

But at that moment, the white wind column's surroundings flashed again, and a massive golden finger shadow descended from the heavens, radiating an aura that could pierce through everything. The finger tip emitted golden sparks that were not lightning, but rather the distortions of the void caused by the golden finger's aura.

The golden finger shadow struck the white wind column, causing it to flash white and desperately resist, but ultimately, it was pierced through, creating a massive hole.

The white wind column's light flashed wildly, and then it shattered with a deafening sound, dispersing into nothingness.

Lei Yu and the others, witnessing this scene, were shocked and delighted, and they quickly flew out of the white spirit domain, joining forces to break through the barrier.

"Time laws! Who dares to break my divine ability? If you dare to act, why hide and not show yourself?" the sharp voice shouted, its gaze sweeping the surroundings.

"I've been standing here all along, but you didn't notice," a voice replied, as a figure emerged from the void outside the white spirit domain. Han Li, with a hint of a smile, said, "I've been standing here, but you didn't notice."

He had spent nearly a day recovering, and his divine abilities, including the True Word Treasure Wheel, had partially recovered.

When he approached the area, Han Li had used the "Myriad Void Silence Technique" and the "Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique" to hide his presence, avoiding the white figure's detection. He then used the "Heavenly Finger Technique" to destroy the white wind column.

The white figure was shocked to see Han Li appear out of nowhere, without any warning, and its divine sense had not detected him. Its heart skipped a beat.

In that moment of surprise, the white figure's divine sense wavered, and the white hand holding Su Zhen and Jing Liu hesitated.

Su Zhen and Jing Liu immediately seized the opportunity, their bodies twisting and turning into two distorted blue lights that broke free from the white hand's grasp and flew towards Han Li.

The white figure's anger grew as it realized it had been outmaneuvered, and without hesitation, it raised its hand to strike.

The white hand shot out like a meteor, almost instantly catching up to Su Zhen and Jing Liu, and was about to grab them.

The white hand's light surged, and a terrifying aura that could crush the void itself descended, enveloping Su Zhen and Jing Liu, causing their fleeing bodies to slow down.

But at that moment, the void in front of them fluctuated, and a massive golden fist shadow emerged, radiating a powerful aura that could shatter the void. The fist shadow collided with the white hand, causing a massive shockwave that shattered both the hand and the fist.

The sound of the collision was deafening, and the surrounding void trembled violently, developing cracks.

Han Li's body was shaken, and he stumbled backward.

The white figure's body also shook, and the white hand was shattered, releasing Su Zhen and Jing Liu from its grasp. They quickly flew towards Han Li, arriving by his side in an instant.
At the same time, Lei Yu Ce and the others flew over, joining Han Li, Su Zhan Cai, and Jin Liu.

"Su Dao friend, Jin Dao friend, Shi Dao friend, you've all arrived, thank you for your help earlier." Lei Yu Ce's pale face regained some color, and he bowed to Su Zhan Cai, Jin Liu, and Han Li.

Although he spoke to the two, his gaze remained fixed on Su Zhan Cai, gentle as water.

"The one who rescued you wasn't me and Jin Liu, but Shi Dao friend, so you should thank him instead." Su Zhan Cai avoided Lei Yu Ce's passionate gaze, speaking calmly.

"Shi Dao friend, thank you for saving us." Lei Yu Ce looked at Han Li, his face flashing with surprise, and thanked him again.

The others, upon hearing this, were also filled with surprise, but still thanked Han Li one by one.

Only Lan Yan, who had already known Han Li's strength, wasn't surprised, his face expressionless, with a mixture of anger, fear, and wariness.

Han Li nodded slightly to Lei Yu Ce and the others, ignoring Lan Yan's reaction, his gaze never leaving the white figure.

Although he had unexpectedly broken through the white wind pillar, the white figure's strength was immense, and he didn't dare to relax.

Fortunately, Lei Yu Ce and the others had escaped, and with everyone's combined strength, the situation had turned around.

"Not bad, not bad, it's finally come to someone with some strength, not in vain for old ancestor to run this errand." The white figure fell silent for a moment, then burst out laughing.

As the laughter faded, the scattered white crystal threads flew back into its body, and the wind pillar around it suddenly stopped, disappearing without a trace, revealing the figure inside â€“ a white jade horse, its body pure white, with a tuft of white horsehair on its back, looking exceptionally majestic.

The white horse stood up on its hind legs, using its front legs to gesture, one holding a green smoke pipe, and the other holding a... thing, its mouth exhaling clouds of smoke.

Han Li and the others were shocked when they saw the figure.

"May I ask your name?" Han Li was initially surprised, but quickly regained his composure, his gaze scanning the white horse's mane, and asked.

"Ah, really blind, not recognizing old ancestor! Remember, old ancestor is Li Qi Ma! Young one, your skills aren't bad, cultivating the time law, and your physical body is quite strong, very much to old ancestor's taste, come, let's have a great battle of three hundred rounds!" Li Qi Ma's eyes gleamed with battle intent, putting down the smoke pipe, and prepared to charge forward.

However, just as he was about to attack, his gaze suddenly flashed, and he let out a soft hum, stopping in his tracks.

The white spiritual domain around Li Qi Ma flashed and disappeared, his body glowing white, transforming into a beam of white light that shot towards the distance, disappearing in an instant.

Han Li had been prepared to fight, but Li Qi Ma suddenly said goodbye and left, leaving him bewildered.

The others were also confused, unsure of what to make of the situation.

But Li Qi Ma's strength was immense, and his sudden departure was a good thing.

Especially since Lei Yu Ce and the others had been fighting Li Qi Ma until now, their spiritual energy was almost depleted, and they needed time to recover, so they took out medicine to replenish their energy.

"Suzi friends, when did you arrive here?" Lei Yu Ce asked Su Zhan Cai after a brief moment of meditation, suppressing the injuries from his earlier battle.

Su Zhan Cai gazed into the distance, seemingly unaware of Lei Yu Ce's question, while Han Li's face was contemplative, as if considering something, and didn't speak.

Jin Liu, seeing this, stepped forward to take the conversation, summarizing their journey to this point, but omitted some sensitive information, such as the beehive they had encountered, and his use of the space treasure to hide other Tian Shui sect disciples, keeping those details hidden.

Han Li listened to Jin Liu's words, his heart stirring, and glanced at him.

The beehive incident was one thing, but Jin Liu's use of the space treasure to hide other disciples was unusual, and Han Li suspected there was more to it, so he used his eyes to probe.

Jin Liu noticed Han Li's gaze and immediately looked away, a faint warning in his eyes.

Han Li's probing had yielded results, and he felt a slight chill, but didn't expose the truth, instead looking away.

Jin Liu saw this and relaxed, continuing to chat with Lei Yu Ce, and asked about their journey.

Lei Yu Ce recounted their journey, which was similar to theirs, with many dangers along the way, and a gradual loss of companions, including some who had disappeared under mysterious circumstances, until only the five of them remained.

Without a way to retreat, and with a sense of discontent, they decided to continue forward, hoping to find a glimmer of hope, or perhaps some opportunities.

Just half a day ago, they had encountered Lan Yan, who was traveling alone, and joined forces, only to be ambushed by Li Qi Ma, and thus they had been fighting until now.

"It seems that no matter which path we take, the ancient tower is extremely treacherous. When we first entered the tower, there were hundreds of us, and now only a few remain." Jin Liu's expression was skeptical, but he didn't press the issue, since he too had hidden many things, and instead wore a look of sorrow, sighing.

Lei Yu Ce and the others heard this, their faces also filled with a mix of emotions, but it was unclear how much of it was genuine.
