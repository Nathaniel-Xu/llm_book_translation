As the intense golden light washed over him, Han Li's clothes were instantly reduced to ashes, his black hair stood on end, and his robust physique was covered in blood-red symbol markings that seemed to sear into his skin.

On his chest, the small black bottle hung suspended in mid-air, swaying gently as if manipulated by an unseen force.

Suddenly, the leaf-patterned design on the bottle's surface glowed with a soft green light, enveloping Han Li's entire body.

"Good boy, it seems you've managed to stumble upon a fortunate opportunity. I'll protect you for now. Just relax and focus on absorbing the power of the time laws. Leave the rest to me," the bottle spirit's voice echoed in his mind.

Han Li was about to retort, "You've finally decided to speak up," but he swallowed his words.

He followed the bottle spirit's advice, no longer resisting or controlling the influx of time law energy, instead opening himself up to the torrential power.

A deafening boom shook the air, as if it had exploded within Han Li's mind.

His consciousness sank into the depths of his mind, and he found himself unable to perceive the changes in his physical body. Instead, his senses became more acute, allowing him to perceive the subtlest changes in his mental realm.

As his thoughts stirred, a brilliant golden light illuminated the void, revealing a series of golden characters that floated before him, like a golden scroll unfolding before his eyes.

Han Li focused his attention on the characters, discovering that they contained the contents of the golden jade scroll that Miro Old Ancestor had given him, including his insights into the time laws and various time-related secrets of the True Speech School.

Among them were the "Law of Heaven and Earth" and the "True Speech Great Hand Seal," two powerful divine abilities.

As Han Li's thoughts shifted, he began to study the characters intently, becoming completely absorbed in the knowledge, forgetting about the outside world and losing track of time.

...

On the isolated island, the seasons passed, and over a decade had elapsed.

The once-thriving island had withered away, becoming a desolate wasteland under the influence of the Great Swamp's miasma.

Ti Huo sat cross-legged beside the broken stele, her eyes closed, while the black box containing the Ghost Witch's residual soul lay beside her on a rock.

A faint voice whispered, and the black box quivered, its surface glowing with a soft, ethereal light. The Ghost Witch's residual soul floated out, hovering in mid-air, her eyes filled with concern as she gazed at Ti Huo.

"The entrance to the stele has been sealed for nearly ten years. Your master is probably dead by now. Why do you insist on staying here? Listen to my advice, and I'll help you find the Six Paths Reincarnation Disk, restoring your memories and divine abilities. You'll know what to do then," the Ghost Witch pleaded.

Ti Huo's expression remained unchanged, her face a mask of indifference.

Just then, a whistling wind sound echoed through the air, and a golden light descended from the sky, striking the ground beside the Ghost Witch's residual soul. The resulting gust of wind sent the Ghost Witch's residual soul stumbling.

Jin Tong emerged from the dust, a small, green creature clutched in her hand.

Her eyes narrowed as she glanced at the Ghost Witch's residual soul, asking, "Is he trying to persuade you to leave with him again?"

"The same old speech, nothing new," Ti Huo replied, her eyes still closed.

The Ghost Witch's voice rose in frustration, "You've lost your spiritual connection with him, why do you still believe he'll return?"

"Because he's my uncle," Jin Tong replied, her voice matter-of-fact.

"My master will definitely return," Ti Huo said, her eyes still closed.

Jin Tong shot the Ghost Witch a glance, then sat down on a nearby rock, playing with the small, green creature in her hand.

The Ghost Witch sighed, transforming into a wisp of smoke that retreated back into the black box.

Meanwhile, within the secret realm of the Yama Palace...

Han Li still sat cross-legged, his body radiating a faint golden glow, which had dissipated, leaving behind a thousand three hundred and nineteen golden light points that marked the various immortal apertures he had opened.

Upon counting them, Han Li realized that he had reached the peak of the Great Luo middle stage.

"Last time, it was uninvited, and this time, it's unattainable. This matter of beheading the corpse is truly puzzling," Han Li sighed, slowly opening his eyes.

The Light of the Years Heaven Array had long since been dismantled, leaving only the Heavenly Domain of the Tian Person realm still open.

In reality, Han Li had already opened these immortal apertures two years ago, but he had chosen to stay and attempt to behead the second corpse, hoping to make a breakthrough.
As a result, the last time was being forced by the "Corpse Severing Talisman" to sever the evil corpse, this time he wanted to actively trigger the benevolent corpse, but he didn't get any reaction, and couldn't sense the trigger for the corpse severing.

"Never mind, after cultivating in the Light Shadow Great Array for tens of thousands of years, the outside world should have also passed at least a decade, Jin Tong and the others should be waiting anxiously." Han Li said as he stood up.

His Five Elements Illusory Realm had all become real, and the time difference power of the Light Shadow Heaven's Great Array had increased several times, now one year on the outside was equivalent to 30,000 years inside the array.

Han Li waved his hand, and the Five Elements Illusory Realm transformed into five time law artifacts, shining with golden light, and wrapped around them were over 1,800 time crystals.

For some reason, after reaching 1,800, the law crystals couldn't be increased anymore.

This time in seclusion, his gains were immense, not only successfully opening his immortal aperture and reaching the peak of the Da Luo middle stage, but also doubling the number of time crystals, and gaining a deeper understanding of time laws, and mastering several powerful divine abilities of the True Speech Sect.

Although he didn't succeed in advancing to the Da Luo late stage as Mi Luo Old Ancestor had hoped, he had still become much stronger.

Han Li's heart moved, and with a wave of his hand, a golden light vortex appeared in front of him, and he walked into it.

On the isolated island, the stone monument that had been silent for a long time suddenly lit up, and Han Li's figure appeared from it.

Ti Hu cried out, opening her eyes.

"Uncle, you're finally out." Jin Tong exclaimed, throwing away the small green beast in her hand.

The black box on the ground lit up, and Gui Wu's figure reappeared.

"Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Han, your cultivation has made great progress." Gui Wu's eyes flashed with surprise, and then returned to normal, congratulating him.

"Who said that my uncle had fallen within?" Jin Tong asked, pouting.

"Fellow Daoist Han's luck is unmatched, how could he fall? You must have misheard." Gui Wu said, his face unchanging.

"I've kept you waiting." Han Li said, not paying attention to their conversation.

"Fellow Daoist Han, I've brought you to this Yan Luo's mansion as promised, now it's your turn to take me to the Six Paths Reincarnation Plate." Gui Wu said.

"I promised you, I'll do it." Han Li said calmly.

Gui Wu was stared at by Han Li, and his heart suddenly skipped a beat, his smiling face momentarily frozen.

"Fellow Daoist Han's experience in the array is truly remarkable, his strength has increased greatly in a short time, it's truly worth celebrating." He quickly regained his composure, and smiled.

Ti Hu and Jin Tong heard this, and their faces showed surprise, but they couldn't see anything out of the ordinary about Han Li.

"Fellow Daoist Gui Wu is overpraising, let's go to the Yellow Springs Great Marsh first, where is that place, please lead the way." Han Li said, his face calm, with a slight smile.

"That place is in the Black River, Di Ming, Yan Luo's three domains intersecting, to get there from here, we need to pass through the Yan Luo domain's various tribal territories, and the Wheel King is usually cultivating near the Six Paths Reincarnation Plate, his subordinates are also stationed near the Yellow Springs Great Marsh, it's not easy to get past." Gui Wu said.

"How do we get past? The Wheel King has unified the three domains, his strength is surely extremely powerful, can we three people resist his army? And what is the Wheel King's current cultivation level?" Han Li asked, his brow furrowed.

"The Wheel King's strength is extremely powerful, he had already reached the Da Luo late stage in the past, now he might have reached the peak of cultivation, but he definitely hasn't become a Dao Ancestor, otherwise I wouldn't have sensed it." Gui Wu said.

Han Li heard this, and his brow twitched. "A single Wheel King is already at the Da Luo peak, you want us to take you there, aren't you sending us to our deaths?" Ti Hu said, her voice low.

"Actually, you don't need to worry, once we reach the Yellow Springs Great Marsh, I have a way to let us sneak in." Gui Wu said, his tone calming.

"What method?" Jin Tong asked.

"Now is too early to say, let me keep it a secret for now, when we reach the Yellow Springs Great Marsh, I'll explain it to you three in detail." Gui Wu said, still smiling.

Jin Tong and Ti Hu looked at Gui Wu's smiling face, and their faces fell.

"Gui Wu, this is no time for jokes, tell us your method, or else they'll get angry, and you know the consequences." Han Li said, his voice low.

"Alright, actually, the Six Paths Reincarnation Plate is a place related to reincarnation, every so often, a powerful wind will erupt, the Six Paths Evil Wind, even a Dao Ancestor wouldn't dare to touch it, at that time, neither the Wheel King nor his subordinates will be near the Yellow Springs Great Marsh, we can sneak in then." Gui Wu said.

"If everything is as you say, we can indeed get in, but that Six Paths Evil Wind is so powerful, how can we get close?" Han Li asked, his face thoughtful.

"I didn't waste my time governing the Yan Luo domain for nothing, I've researched the Six Paths Evil Wind for many years, and know some loopholes that can be exploited, although the time is limited, it's enough for us to make a round trip." Gui Wu said, smiling smugly.
