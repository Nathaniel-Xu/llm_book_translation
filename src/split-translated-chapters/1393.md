In a certain place on the Lingjie Continent, the air was filled with the sound of thunder. Han Li's figure suddenly appeared in the void.

His heart stirred, and a powerful divine sense spread out, covering the entire Lingjie Continent in an instant.

The next moment, a loud thunderclap sounded, and Han Li's figure was once again engulfed in a flash of lightning. When the lightning dissipated, his figure had vanished.

In the depths of the Wuyi Sea, there was a small island with an area of only 20-30 miles. The surrounding sea was endless, with howling winds and massive waves crashing against the shore. The island was surrounded by a sea of turbulent waves, like a thousand horses galloping.

Above the island, a large number of five-colored tribulation clouds floated in the void, emitting a thick and heavy killing aura. Around these clouds, new tribulation clouds were constantly forming under the interweaving of five-colored lights.

Under the layers of tribulation clouds, a woman in a white robe stood facing the wind, her figure slender and elegant. It was Yuan Yao.

Her white robe fluttered in the wind, and her hands were constantly forming hand seals. Her beautiful face had a hint of solemnity.

Around her, 72 flying swords floated in the air, each emitting a brilliant light. The lights converged to form a large, blue-colored sword lotus, protecting her figure.

Besides the sword lotus, there were also several other treasures floating beside her.

In the distance, several beautiful figures stood in the air, watching Yuan Yao's situation.

If Han Li were here, he would recognize these people, who were not only familiar to him but also his close friends. They were Nangong Wan, Yanli, Bingfeng, and Yin Yue.

Their cultivation had reached the Great Completion realm, and their appearance had not changed much.

Apart from Nangong Wan and the others, there was no one else nearby.

After a while, the five-colored tribulation clouds accumulated to a size of hundreds of miles. Suddenly, they began to roll and churn, with a large, black hole appearing in the center of each cloud.

"Yuan Yao, you must hold on!" Yanli whispered, her hands clenched into fists.

Nangong Wan looked up at the thick, colorless tribulation clouds, a hint of worry in her eyes. But she did not speak, only gazing intently at Yuan Yao.

Bingfeng and Yin Yue also looked worried, but they knew they could not disturb Yuan Yao at this moment. They could only pray silently.

Yuan Yao looked up at the tribulation clouds, her eyebrows furrowed. She seemed to have sensed something, and her hands moved faster, forming hand seals. The blue-colored sword lotus around her began to glow brighter, and she also activated the other treasures.

In an instant, the sword lotus around her was surrounded by a multitude of colorful lights, making her beautiful face even more stunning.

Just then, a loud rumbling sound came from the tribulation clouds, and a massive amount of fire rain poured down from the black holes, covering Yuan Yao.

The temperature in the surrounding void skyrocketed, and the island's vegetation was instantly incinerated. The ground turned into a sea of molten lava.

The sea water around the island evaporated, forming a massive crater. The surrounding sea water rushed in, but it was immediately evaporated.

Yuan Yao's face was still calm, but her nose was beaded with sweat.

She swung her arm, and the blue-colored sword lotus around her began to spin rapidly, emitting a multitude of sword energies that constantly cut through the fire rain.

However, the fire rain continued to pour down, and its intensity only increased.

The tribulation lasted for a full incense stick's time, and Yuan Yao was still holding on. But her face had turned pale, and she was covered in sweat.

The blue-colored sword lotus around her was still shining brightly, but if one looked closely, they could see that some of the flying swords had begun to develop small cracks. The cracks were spreading, and the sword lotus was on the verge of collapse.

The other treasures were also in a similar state, having reached their limits.

Just then, the five-colored tribulation clouds suddenly stopped pouring down fire rain, and the surrounding void's temperature dropped rapidly.

The sky and earth returned to their normal state, as if nothing had happened.

Yanli, Yin Yue, and the others watched from a distance, their faces relaxing. Nangong Wan's face was still calm, but her eyes seemed to hold a hint of concern.

Yuan Yao took a deep breath and quickly pulled out a blue-colored pill, swallowing it.

But before she could refine the pill, the five-colored tribulation clouds began to converge, forming a massive, five-colored vortex. The vortex was surrounded by a thick, black hole.

A loud rumbling sound came from the vortex, and a purple-colored lightning bolt flashed out, followed by a multitude of purple-colored lightning arcs. They condensed into massive, purple-colored lightning balls, each one emitting a dazzling display of lightning.

The lightning balls poured down from the sky, covering Yuan Yao. Although they did not cause the temperature to rise, they were even more terrifying than the fire rain.

Yuan Yao gritted her teeth, her hands forming hand seals as she activated the remaining divine energy within her. She poured all her energy into the sword lotus and the other treasures.
The azure sword lotus's radiance greatly increased, its range expanding nearly twofold, as countless azure sword energies intertwined to form sword dragons that charged towards the numerous purple lightning balls.

The few treasures transformed into brilliant lights, joining the azure sword lotus as they soared into the sky.

The intense, explosive sounds of the collision between the two sides shook the air, and upon contact, they burst apart like oil meeting water.

The purple lightning balls' power far surpassed that of the azure sword lotus and the treasures, and after a brief pause, they effortlessly shattered the azure sword lotus and the treasures, mercilessly falling towards the defenseless Yuan Yao.

At this moment, Yuan Yao's internal energy had nearly been depleted, and although she still had some tricks up her sleeve, they were no match for the previous treasures. A faint, mournful smile appeared on her beautiful face.

"Brother Han, it seems we truly have no fate to meet again in this life..." she whispered to herself, abandoning all resistance and closing her eyes.

"Yuan Yao, don't give up!" Yan Li couldn't help but shout, her voice trembling with tears.

Nan Gong Wan softly sighed, closing her eyes as a single tear rolled down her cheek.

Bing Feng and Yin Yue, although anxious to assist Yuan Yao, were powerless to intervene in this scale of heavenly tribulation. They couldn't even get close.

The numerous purple lightning balls rolled down, engulfing Yuan Yao's body, and the thunderous sounds shook the heavens, drowning out Yan Li's anguished cries in the distance.

The rolling lightning illuminated the destruction of Yuan Yao's protective aura, and the terrifying power of the lightning was about to tear her body apart.

Just as all hope seemed lost, a golden ancient mirror suddenly appeared above Yuan Yao's head, its surface radiating golden light that instantly formed a protective barrier around her.

The purple lightning balls struck the golden barrier, but it only trembled slightly, steadfastly guarding Yuan Yao.

Yuan Yao only heard the thunderous sounds, but did not await the heavenly lightning's descent. She opened her eyes, gazing at the scene before her in shock and awe.

"How... how is this possible?" Yuan Yao whispered to herself.

She did not believe that anyone in this world could defy the power of the heavenly tribulation.

Nearby, a figure emerged from the turbulent sea, and it was Han Li, who had finally arrived.

"Ah, I've finally made it..." Han Li's eyes locked onto Yuan Yao, his face relaxing slightly.

The heavenly tribulation in the sky seemed to sense someone intervening, and it suddenly expanded tenfold, as if enraged.

A massive, unprecedented heavenly tribulation erupted, and the nearby Nan Gong Wan and others were caught off guard, their eyes rolling back as they fell into a deep slumber, plummeting towards the sea below.

Han Li saw this and quickly snapped his fingers.

A gentle, golden light appeared beneath the women, supporting them and carrying them to a safe distance.

He had just finished this when the five-colored heavenly tribulation in the sky intensified, and countless massive purple lightning balls rolled down, striking the golden ancient mirror. The mirror's protective barrier rippled, but Han Li's voice was calm and collected.

"Hmph!"

Han Li's fingers danced in a subtle motion, and the golden ancient mirror's surface flowed with spiritual energy. The golden barrier immediately solidified, unaffected by the increasingly intense lightning.

Yuan Yao gazed blankly at the lightning balls exploding mere inches from her, feeling as though she was dreaming.

A full minute passed, and the purple lightning balls finally dissipated.

The five-colored heavenly tribulation let out a muffled sound, before suddenly bursting apart and dispersing.

A purple light flashed across the sky, and a long, white fissure appeared.

A white light pillar shot down from the fissure, enveloping Yuan Yao's body.

"How... how did I... I've actually survived the heavenly tribulation..." Yuan Yao's face was filled with ecstatic joy.

She suddenly remembered something and looked around, her eyes locking onto Han Li in the distance.

"Thank you, esteemed immortal, for your timely assistance. I wonder if I might behold your true form, and I shall forever remember this in my heart." Yuan Yao said with gratitude.

Han Li smiled faintly, but did not reveal his true form.

At that moment, a massive, unseen force descended from the white light pillar, and Yuan Yao's body was lifted into the air, disappearing into the distance.

Han Li let out a gentle sigh, then gazed at the small vial in his hand, his brow furrowed.

The vial was now nearly transparent, and it couldn't last much longer.

His face suddenly changed, and he activated the vial, a golden light flashing as he returned to the time-space tunnel, transforming into a phantom that flew towards the depths of the tunnel.

A moment later, he snapped his fingers, and the white light around him intensified, and he vanished from the time-space tunnel, reappearing above a different, turbid sea.
