“Lightning of Time!” Han Li's eyes flickered, and his hands rapidly formed a seal.

Around him, golden light flashed, and five golden objects suddenly appeared, which were the True Words Treasure Wheel, the Illusory Hourglass, the Time Cleansing Vessel, the Time Severing Torch, and the Dong Yi Divine Tree, all of which were Time Law objects.

These five Time Law objects, after recombining, had undergone a tremendous transformation.

The five treasures rotated rapidly, shining with a pure and translucent golden light, as the Time Law fluctuations spread out.

Boom!

Before Han Li could react, the golden lightning bolts descended.

The calamity clouds underwent a series of changes, as if accelerated by a divine technique, and were incredibly fast.

Fortunately, Han Li had already taken a step into the Dao Ancestor realm, and his reaction was extremely fast. He raised his arms towards the sky.

The Taiyu Law Shield suddenly burst forth with golden light, rapidly rotating, and countless golden symbols spewed out, emitting a series of intense whistling sounds.

A shocking explosion shook the heavens, and countless golden lightning bolts struck the Taiyu Law Shield, causing it to immediately develop numerous cracks that rapidly expanded.

With a muffled boom, the Taiyu Law Shield disintegrated, then exploded, turning into countless golden fragments that shot towards the surroundings like meteors.

However, the Taiyu Law Shield had already given Han Li enough time, and the True Words Treasure Wheel and the other objects rapidly rotated around his body.

A gigantic golden vortex reappeared, enveloping Han Li, emitting an almost boundless and terrifying power, and facing the descending golden lightning bolts.

Countless golden lightning bolts struck the vortex, causing it to tremble, but the vortex's absorbing power immediately caught them, pulling them towards its center.

Han Li stood at the center of the vortex, his body swaying with the vortex's movements, but his hands remained stable, constantly forming seals.

The golden vortex rotated with a low rumble, showing no signs of weakening, and formed a standoff with the Lightning of Time in the air.

Golden light flickered, lightning illuminated the surroundings, and countless thunderous explosions shook the air, causing the nearby void to violently tremble.

The Wheel of Reincarnation's master and the Demon Master, who were standing far away, were unable to stand still and were constantly pushed back.

The tremors lasted for half a minute, and the dense golden lightning bolts finally began to weaken, soon disappearing completely.

The golden vortex below rapidly shrank, disappearing without a trace after a few breaths.

Han Li's figure reappeared, his body battered and bruised, looking somewhat disheveled, but overall, he seemed to be unharmed.

At this moment, the calamity clouds in the air underwent another rapid change, and the golden light quickly dissipated, transforming back into its original gray-black color.

A purple light flashed within the calamity clouds, and a purple longbow shot out, enveloping Han Li's body, swirling around him.

One end of the purple longbow flashed into his body.

Han Li's battered body quickly recovered, and his injuries were healed in the blink of an eye.

A brilliant golden light burst forth from his body, containing golden threads that merged with the purple longbow in the air.

Accompanied by a sharp whistle, the golden light rapidly intensified, transforming into a magnificent golden dragon-like light that swirled around Han Li's head, emitting a Time Law power that could shake the heavens.

The void emitted a series of thunderous sounds, as if it was collapsing and distorting.

The Wheel of Reincarnation's master, the Demon Master, and the others, who had already retreated to a safe distance, were once again unable to stand still and were forced to retreat further.

The golden light didn't linger around Han Li for long, soon disappearing into his body.

Han Li's eyebrows rose, and his face showed a look of surprise.

Because, as the golden light entered his body, the Time Law threads within him rapidly disappeared, merging into one, and his entire body emitted a thin, golden light, making him seem almost translucent.

Han Li's Nascent Soul and the divine soul in his mind quietly dissolved, like ice melting, and merged into his body.

The law power within him was quickly suppressed, and the void's tremors slowly dissipated.

The calamity clouds in the air disappeared, and everything returned to calm...

Han Li floated in the void, feeling the changes in the world, and a golden, winding river appeared in his eyes, with a thin branch flowing out, connecting to himself through the void.

He raised his hands, looking at his arms, and discovered that his skin was as thin and translucent as rice paper, with his blood vessels and bones clearly visible, one filled with golden blood, and the other a crystal-like white.

"This is the legendary Golden Veins and Jade Bones, I never thought that after becoming a Dao Ancestor, I would feel this way..." Han Li's eyes shone with excitement, murmuring to himself.

But as soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly felt a sense of connection, and his eyes closed, as his divine sense began to roam the entire Middle Realm, seeing the shattered mountains and rivers, the dead souls, and the chaotic heavenly energies, all appearing in his mind.
As he wandered aimlessly, his divine sense had already transcended the boundaries of the Xian Domain, spreading outwards into the vast expanse of the void. The expanding chaos vortex had engulfed the entire sky, swallowing up vast swaths of empty space, like a giant lid covering the entire Middle Earth Xian Domain.

On the ground, the mountains, forests, and earth were crumbling, while the rivers, lakes, and seas were rapidly disintegrating. It was as if the entire world was being torn apart, like the first time Han Li had seen the Time Crystal Wall, where everything was being broken down into tiny, glowing particles that flew into the air.

The countless living things that had been born from the combination of the Five Elements were now slowly returning to their origins, being absorbed by the chaos vortex.

In the midst of the chaos, Han Li saw the countless corpses on the ground slowly dissolving and dispersing, while the surviving cultivators were fleeing in all directions, unsure of where to go.

The heavens and earth had changed, and the end of the world was near. Where could they escape to?

On the crumbling earth, Meng Po was fleeing with her disciple, Yu Menghan, having already separated from Li Yuanji and the others. They were constantly dodging the shockwaves caused by the collapsing earth.

Meng Po, who had once been a powerful existence, had been severely weakened after being drained of her powers by the divine array. Despite this, she still held onto Yu Menghan's hand tightly.

Yu Menghan's clothes were tattered and dirty, but her face showed no fear. She looked at Meng Po, who was still protecting her, with a calm and gentle gaze.

The two of them had barely escaped a rapidly expanding spatial rift when a spatial vortex suddenly appeared beneath them, pulling them down into the depths.

As they fell, Meng Po looked at Yu Menghan with a hint of regret, thinking that if they had stayed in the sect, they might have been able to avoid this apocalyptic scene.

Yu Menghan smiled warmly and shook her head, looking up at the sky. She wanted to see that person one more time.

Just as she turned her head, a golden light shot out from the void, wrapping around the two of them and pulling them out of the spatial vortex.

"Yu, you and your master should go to my treasure realm and hide for now," Han Li said, appearing beside them.

He waved his hand, and a silver light gate opened up in the void.

"Ha-" Yu Menghan began to speak, but was interrupted by a loud explosion.

A deafening boom shook the heavens, and the round sun that had been hanging in the sky suddenly exploded, casting the entire Middle Earth Xian Domain into eternal darkness.

"Let's go first," Han Li said, his brow furrowed in concern, looking up at the sky.

Yu Menghan nodded and stepped forward, entering the light gate.

Meng Po didn't say a word, but her eyes were fixed on Han Li, sizing him up. She knew his identity and could see his current cultivation level, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration.

Her own judgment of character was not bad, and her disciple's choice of partner was even better.

Although her own cultivation was not enough, she had a feeling that the person in front of her might be the greatest variable in the entire True Immortal Realm, including the True Immortal Realm itself.

If not for this person, the ancient or modern world might have already succeeded.

Han Li, who had already become a Dao Ancestor, didn't know the thoughts of Meng Po and Yu Menghan. His eyes shone brightly with golden light, and his aura had already stabilized. He turned his gaze upwards, looking at the sky.

There, he saw Guo or Jin, standing alone, with the chaos vortex raging behind him, engulfing half of his body. He looked like he was about to be swallowed up by the vortex.

But his face showed no fear, only excitement.

His eyes had lost their black pupils, replaced by two gray whirlpools that rotated continuously, emitting a strange and irresistible attraction.

On the left side of the void, the Demon Lord was forming a seal with his hands, creating a giant silver tower that shot towards Guo or Jin. On the right side, the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth was controlling the six wheels of rebirth, firing a beam of light that shot towards Guo or Jin.

Guo or Jin simply raised his hands, and two massive chaos hands emerged from the vortex, pressing down on the two attackers and holding them in place.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he formed a seal with his hands, activating the Five Elements Fantasy World technique. The five time law objects appeared around him, floating in the air.

The five objects shone with dazzling golden light, emitting a powerful time law fluctuation that shook the air.

Han Li's hands merged in front of him, and his mind stirred. The sensation of wandering through the ages and merging with the heavens reappeared, and the winding river of time reappeared.

Guo or Jin, who was in the midst of the chaos vortex, suddenly felt a connection, and his eyes turned towards Han Li.

A hint of surprise flashed across his face, and he muttered to himself, "He's succeeded... no, his connection to the time law is even stronger than mine!"
