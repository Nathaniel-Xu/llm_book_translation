Feng Qing Shui's body trembled violently, and his entire being was crushed by the released spiritual domain, causing his aura to plummet.

He clearly wouldn't give up easily, and under his support, the shattered blue spiritual domain continued to clash with the increasingly brilliant golden spiritual domain. However, it wasn't long before he discovered that in the collision between the blue and golden spiritual domains, the blue color was becoming increasingly scarce, while the golden color was becoming more abundant.

Finally, after the last remnants of blue were consumed by the gold, Feng Qing Shui let out a loud "Ah" as he spat out a large mouthful of blood, plummeting downwards towards the sea like a fallen giant.

Han Li's face was also somewhat pale, as maintaining a spiritual domain of this level for so long was no small burden, even for a cultivator at the peak of the Da Luo realm.

But at this moment, he had to win, and couldn't show even a hint of weakness.

Looking at Feng Qing Shui's rapid descent, Han Li clenched his fist and struck out fiercely.

Five brilliant golden lights shot out from his released golden spiritual domain, intersecting and condensing into a massive golden fist - the Da Wu Xing Mie Jue Fist.

The golden fist's surface flashed with golden light, and in an instant, it caught up to Feng Qing Shui, smashing downwards.

Feng Qing Shui saw this and spat out a mouthful of essence blood, his hands forming a difficult seal.

The seal and essence blood merged into one, fusing into the void.

A dazzling blue light shot out, and it was none other than the blue sun from the secret realm, which had transformed into a massive blue battle-axe over a hundred feet in size.

The battle-axe radiated countless blue lights, and emitted a powerful law that was far stronger than Feng Qing Shui's own, and even surpassed Han Li's Qing Zhu Feng Yun Sword.

"Second-grade immortal artifact!" Han Li's eyes narrowed, instantly recognizing that Feng Qing Shui had unleashed his trump card.

As Feng Qing Shui pointed with his finger, the blue battle-axe's surface flashed with blue light, transforming into a heavenly blue rainbow that instantly blocked the incoming golden fist.

A deafening crash echoed out!

The golden fist shattered, dispersing into countless golden lights.

The blue battle-axe's surface flashed with blue light, its momentum unstoppable as it pierced through the scattered golden lights, leaving a blue trail in the golden spiritual domain as it rapidly stabbed towards Han Li.

"You dare to contend with the Dao Ancestor's glory?" Feng Qing Shui's mouth was smeared with blood, but his eyes flashed with a hint of madness.

Han Li gazed at the incoming blue battle-axe, his expression calm and composed, which made Feng Qing Shui's heart skip a beat.

Just as the blue battle-axe was about to reach Han Li, his eyes suddenly flashed with golden light, and the entire golden spiritual domain trembled.

The blue battle-axe, which had been advancing with unstoppable momentum, suddenly stopped in its tracks.

In the next instant, under Feng Qing Shui's shocked gaze, the blue battle-axe's surface was covered in golden light, and it exploded into countless fragments.

"Damn it!" Feng Qing Shui's heart was filled with terror.

He flipped his right hand, revealing a blue token, which he crushed into pieces.

At the same time, he summoned his last ounce of strength, and his body radiated a massive amount of blue mist.

Feng Qing Shui's body trembled slightly, and in an instant, he transformed into hundreds of identical clones, all of which fled in different directions at incredible speeds.

Han Li sneered, his hands forming a seal.

A thunderous rumble echoed out!

The Thunder Net surrounding the Tian Hai Continent flashed with golden light, and countless golden lightning bolts shot out from all directions, encasing the clones within.

The golden lightning arced through the air, and in an instant, the clones exploded and disappeared, leaving only Feng Qing Shui's original body behind.

Moreover, his body was surrounded by a layer of golden lightning, forming a lightning cocoon that left him unable to move.

"In the past, the True Monarch didn't eradicate all of the Zhen Yan Sect, leaving behind remnants like you!" Feng Qing Shui's voice was hoarse with rage.

"Today, I'll send you to the ancient or modern era to report a message: if you don't release my Dao companion, Nan Gong Wan, I'll kill my way to the Heavenly Court!"

Han Li's voice fell, and he struck out with his fist once more.

The Da Wu Xing Mie Jue Fist's golden shadow reappeared, larger and more powerful than before, carrying an aura of destruction as it charged towards Feng Qing Shui.

Just as it was about to strike, the entire Long Yuan Xian Domain began to violently shake, and a terrifying power that surpassed Feng Qing Shui's by over ten times surged in, striking the golden Thunder Net.

The Thunder Net's golden light flashed with an unbearable load, distorting and warping.

A deafening crash echoed out!

The Thunder Net was torn apart, revealing a gap.

Almost simultaneously, the sea beneath Feng Qing Shui churned and foamed, creating a massive whirlpool that sucked him in, along with the surrounding lightning cocoon.

The golden fist struck empty air, sinking into the sea.

A deafening rumble echoed out!

A massive golden sun, hundreds of millions of miles in size, appeared, annihilating everything within its range.

Han Li's face was dark and foreboding, but he didn't care about the golden sun. Instead, he turned to look outside the Thunder Net.
That terrifying massive power suddenly disappeared, as if it had hidden itself away, and Feng Qing's aura also vanished.

He let out a cold snort, his hands swiftly forming a seal.

The golden lightning net immediately collapsed, transforming into seventy-two green bamboo beehive swords, shooting out in different directions towards the surroundings.

The green bamboo beehive swords, now a third-grade immortal artifact, were incredibly fast, instantly flying to various locations in the immortal realm, hovering in mid-air above the different forces.

Han Li's hands moved like wheels, forming a seal, as the seventy-two green bamboo beehive swords simultaneously burst forth with golden lightning, radiating outward in a wave-like pattern, as if sensing something.

The next moment, a look of joy flashed across Han Li's face, and his body was enveloped in a flash of lightning, disappearing instantly.

At the edge of the Dragon Abyss Immortal Realm, a sea area had a green bamboo beehive sword hovering above it.

A flash of lightning appeared above the flying sword, and Han Li's figure materialized, with no time interval in between.

This was the new ability obtained by the green bamboo beehive sword after its spiritual awakening, allowing Han Li to instantly arrive at the location of the flying sword, regardless of the distance, through his connection with the sword.

His divine sense expanded instantly, and he raised his hand to tap the void.

The void around him flashed, and a time domain appeared, as if a golden giant beast was pouncing towards the sea area below.

The seawater below instantly evaporated, revealing a group of dark blue light enveloping Feng Qing, who was trapped by the time domain's power.

The dark blue light rotated in place, unable to move forward.

But at this moment, a massive blue glow burst forth from the nearby sea area, and that terrifying massive power fluctuation reappeared, as a pure blue spirit domain flew out from the nearby sea area, covering Feng Qing.

The blue spirit domain contained all sorts of water transformations, including waves, clouds, icebergs, and cold currents, as if this place was the source of all water, encompassing all water transformations in the universe.

The time domain almost simultaneously descended, and the two spirit domains collided.

The expected earth-shaking explosion did not occur, as Han Li's time domain seemed to collide with a soft wall.

The blue spirit domain deeply sank, but remained taut.

Han Li felt that the time domain's immense power was being completely absorbed by the blue spirit domain, like a massive ocean.

However, the blue spirit domain also seemed to be struggling, as numerous water lights violently shook, as if reaching its limit.

"Who is secretly interfering? Come out!" Han Li shouted, his hands forming a seal.

The time domain's golden light burst forth, and those golden gates reappeared, about to connect with the outside world, amplifying the spirit domain's power to its limit, ready to break through the blue spirit domain.

This blue spirit domain, although much stronger than Feng Qing's spirit domain, Han Li was confident he could break through it.

"Brother Han, please calm down, we have no intention of opposing you. South Palace Wan is here, and we will return her to you!" Just then, a voice came from within the blue spirit domain.

Before the voice had finished, a blue light shot out from the spirit domain, carrying a palace-dressed woman, South Palace Wan, who was placed at the intersection of the two spirit domains.

"Wan!"

Han Li's body shook, and a look of surprise appeared on his face, as he quickly stopped amplifying the time domain's power, to avoid harming South Palace Wan.

At the same time, he waved his hand, sending a golden light to envelop South Palace Wan, bringing her into the time domain.

Han Li used the spirit domain's power to examine South Palace Wan, confirming that it was indeed her, and not a transformed substitute, and his heart slightly relaxed.

However, South Palace Wan was currently unconscious, her eyes tightly closed, as if her divine soul had been sealed.

Han Li's finger touched her brow, and a surge of divine soul energy entered South Palace Wan's mind.

The seal on South Palace Wan's mind was a ordinary sealing technique, and could be easily broken.

However, with a powerful enemy present, it was not advisable to act rashly.

He waved his hand, bringing South Palace Wan into the flower branch space, and then retracted the time domain's power, shrinking its range to a hundred miles, but not dispelling it.

The opposing blue spirit domain also retracted its power, retreating a distance, and Han Li did not press forward.

"Ah, you must be Brother Han, who has inherited the True Word Sect's mantle, and has already mastered the time laws, congratulations, congratulations!" A blue-clad, blue-haired girl flew out from the blue spirit domain, her figure fluttering.

The girl had two round, black eyes, a small nose, and a small mouth, with her hair tied in many small braids, and a coquettish appearance.

Her blue clothing was simple and cool, revealing her white, jade-like arms and legs, and her feet were bare, with delicate blue rings on her wrists and ankles, which had small, exquisite bells that rang out.

However, the most striking feature was the two pink, dragon-like horns on her forehead, and her body seemed to be surrounded by a subtle, true spirit bloodline aura.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, but quickly relaxed.

His portrait had long been on the Heavenly Court's wanted list, but previously, his cultivation was weak, and he was not particularly noticeable, so Feng Qing had not recognized him.

This blue-haired girl, who had suddenly appeared, had called out his name, and seemed to have a significant background.
