Han Li's expression changed, and he hastily shouted to the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth and the Demon Master, "This is not good, he wants to refine the Heavenly Vessel, we must stop him immediately!"

The Demon Master's eyebrows furrowed, "The chaotic laws of the past and present have already taken effect, his physical body is almost indestructible, how can we stop him?"

The Master of the Wheel of Rebirth fell silent for a moment before speaking again, "I have a method that we can try, if it doesn't work, then we have no other options..."

He then transmitted his voice to Han Li and the Demon Master, carefully explaining his plan.

"Perhaps it's worth a try," the Demon Master nodded.

"But..." Han Li hesitated.

"Whether it succeeds or not, the key is still with you, don't hesitate. I believe in you, you won't disappoint me," the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth smiled and said.

Han Li looked at the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth, then nodded heavily.

The Master of the Wheel of Rebirth's face had a few more hints of a carefree smile, and his body suddenly sprang forward, actively approaching Guo Huo.

"Guo Huo, you previously laughed at me for not knowing the scenery of the ancestral realm, today I'll take a look at the scenery above, see if it's as unbearable as you said?" The Master of the Wheel of Rebirth stopped 1,000,000 miles away and shouted.

"You previously used the power of the Great Luo realm to activate the laws of the Dao Ancestor, and have already been merged with the Heavenly Dao, even if you take another step, what can you do?" Guo Huo sneered.

As soon as his words fell, the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth's body began to float, and the six wheels of the Wheel of Rebirth behind him started to rotate, releasing one after another wheel of rebirth symbols that fell into his body.

As the symbols fell onto his body, the dark red glow on the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth's body grew stronger, and his slender figure, hidden under the dark red light, seemed like a death god from hell.

His body floated up, and his eyes rolled with red light as threads of the Wheel of Rebirth laws emerged from his body, connecting with the six wheels of the Wheel of Rebirth.

The six wheels of the Wheel of Rebirth began to rotate slowly, and the six lights of the Wheel of Rebirth converged into the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth's body.

The Master of the Wheel of Rebirth let out a loud roar, and the red glow surrounding his body surged up like a flame, with waves of flame flashing at the edges, emitting intense Wheel of Rebirth law fluctuations.

Guo Huo's eyes narrowed, and he pushed his hands forward, creating a chaotic whirlpool that flew towards the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth.

At the same time, the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth also pushed his hands forward, and a chaotic beam of light shot out from his palm, colliding with the whirlpool, and the two forces were evenly matched, locked in a stalemate.

"Shi Dao friend, take action!" Han Li shouted.

The Demon Master stepped forward, and in an instant, he appeared behind Guo Huo, his hands grasping the air, and the space around him began to distort, compressing the space around Guo Huo.

A sound of grinding and scraping echoed, and the compressed space emitted a crystal-like glow, binding Guo Huo in place.

"Even if you three great sovereigns of the laws apply pressure, you still can't do anything to me," Guo Huo laughed loudly.

A chaotic glow began to emanate from his body, trying to transform into a chaotic whirlpool to absorb the attacks of Han Li and the others.

"No way," the Demon Master roared.

His body emitted a silver glow, and the space laws around him fluctuated wildly, creating a black whirlpool that began to envelop his body.

However, the Demon Master seemed completely unaware of this, and continued to output his law power.

On the other side, the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth's six wheels of the Wheel of Rebirth accelerated to an incredible speed, and his body began to emit an intense aura.

In an instant, the thin barrier between the Great Luo and the Dao Ancestor was broken.

The Master of the Wheel of Rebirth finally took the last step, becoming a true Wheel of Rebirth Ancestor.

The surrounding heaven and earth suddenly gathered clouds, and the spiritual energy transformed into wind, and the wind and clouds merged, as the Wheel of Rebirth laws surged in from all directions, pouring into the six wheels of the Wheel of Rebirth.

The six wheels of the Wheel of Rebirth rotated at an incredible speed, becoming a dark red glow that flashed rapidly.

At the same time, Han Li's body had already leaped into the air.

His Tianxia Town Prison and True Spirit Bloodline powers reached their peak, and his body expanded a hundredfold, transforming into a giant with twelve True Spirit heads and thirty-six arms.

Each arm grasped a Qingzhu Fengyun Sword, and as he rotated in mid-air, he created a massive golden dragon vortex that brought chaos to the heavens and earth.
The true words of the Treasure Wheel and the five time law incarnations transformed into a bright moon and stars, with mountains, rivers, and lakes surrounding the whirlpool, connected by golden lightning between them, as if they were all one.

Inside the golden dragon vortex, the ancient sword aura intersected and crisscrossed, and a heavenly sword array emerged, emitting thunderous roars and exuding an aura of terror.

When Guo or Jin saw this scene, his heart trembled, and a hint of madness flashed across his face. He let out a loud roar: "If you want to die, I'll fulfill your wish."

As soon as he finished speaking, he used his hands to forcefully open the space constraints that the Demon Lord had suppressed, and a chaotic light burst forth from his chest, instantly suppressing the whirlpool and the cycle of light.

The chaotic light surged forward, unstoppable, and directly forced the cycle of light to retreat.

The Lord of the Cycle of Rebirth let out a loud shout, and the six wheels of the cycle of rebirth behind him, which had been shrinking, suddenly disappeared, transforming into a pure dark red energy that surged into his body, causing his originally thin body to swell up.

At this moment, he looked like he had returned to his original appearance, but the aura he exuded was even more terrifying, as if he could stir up the cycle of heaven and earth, controlling life and death.

"Guo or Jin, you can't escape the cycle of rebirth, and you'll never be able to return to the cycle of rebirth again, haha..." The Lord of the Cycle of Rebirth laughed maniacally.

His laughter echoed through the heavens, but his body suddenly shrunk rapidly, until he completely disappeared, transforming into a pure cycle of rebirth energy that broke through the chaotic light, flashing past, and directly entered Guo or Jin's body.

All of this happened in the blink of an eye.

Guo or Jin was shocked, clearly not expecting this, and wanted to stop it, but it was too late.

In an instant, the cycle of heaven and earth seemed to come to a standstill, and all living beings in the world, whether they were fleeing in panic or waiting for death, all felt a sense of dizziness.

It was as if their souls had left their bodies, and they saw a faint red glow, like the last rays of the sun.

After a moment, the cycle of rebirth resumed, and everyone returned to normal, except for one person.

Guo or Jin's soul was still floating outside his body, separated from his chaotic body.

At this moment, he finally realized what the three of them were trying to do, and his face contorted in terror.

His ethereal hands flailed wildly in the air, trying to return to his body, but a golden light had already swept in.

The golden dragon vortex outside, which had been transformed by Han Li, had absorbed the moon, stars, mountains, and rivers, and transformed into a massive sword blade wrapped in black magic energy, descending from the sky with an unstoppable aura.

The sword blade emitted a torrent of time law energy, filling the entire void, and the void froze, becoming completely still.

Only the eternal sword, which had been swung by Han Li using the Heavenly Executioner's Prison technique, combined with the power of the Five Elements Annihilation Fist, continuously shattered the void, falling onto Guo or Jin's body.

At this moment, there was no thunderous roar, no void shaking, only a grayish light enveloping the void, which shattered silently, opening a massive rift that spanned the entire Middle Earth Xian domain.

Guo or Jin's soul face was frozen, and his body, which had been condensed from chaotic energy, began to dissipate inch by inch.

The entire world seemed to lose its color and sound.

This scene remained frozen for dozens of breaths before a dark green light suddenly burst forth from the center of the chaotic body, hovering in the void, flashing with a bright and dark light.

"Boom, boom, boom..."

A series of loud explosions echoed through the void, unceasing.

The sword light had fallen, and Guo or Jin had been reduced to dust, while the sword light's origin, Han Li, reappeared.

He had restored his original form, but his face was pale as snow, and a golden thread flowed slowly from his seven orifices, writhing like a snake.

On his left shoulder, a wisp of black smoke rose, and when it dissipated, it revealed that his left arm had been eroded by the heavenly path, disappearing completely.

He raised his remaining right arm, wiping away the golden blood on his face, his body trembling uncontrollably.

By his side, a silver light gate opened, and Nan Gong Wan's figure emerged, gazing at the shattered void in front of her, especially the massive rift that spanned the sky.

"Husband..." Nan Gong Wan called out, rushing to support Han Li.

Han Li's face showed no joy, only a slow shake of his head, and he spoke in a low voice:

"Guo or Jin has been killed by us..."

Han Li's voice was barely audible, but Nan Gong Wan's eyes widened in shock, and she looked at Han Li with a mix of concern and fear.
