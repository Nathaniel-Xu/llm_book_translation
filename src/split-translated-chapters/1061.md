The yin ghosts that had previously been fearless and unyielding in the face of the Qinglong Hunyuan Array, now felt an instinctual fear as the rolling thunder of the Bixie Shen Lei struck them. They scattered in disarray, fleeing in all directions.

However, the speed of the golden lightning was too fast, and in just a few flashes, nearly half of the yin ghosts were consumed and incinerated in a burst of crackling energy.

The few people who had been surrounded by the ghosts earlier were now able to see the light of day once more. They were overjoyed and excited.

In particular, Fu Gu Zhu, who had been watching Han Li's figure, was shocked and delighted. He couldn't help but wonder if this Stone Dao friend was a Taiyi cultivator?

Jin Liu and Su Qianqian exchanged a glance, and both saw a hint of shock in each other's eyes.

Han Li's gaze remained fixed on the high sky, his attention still focused on the lead-colored clouds that had been accumulating above.

But now, no one dared to show disrespect towards him.

Su Qianqian followed Han Li's gaze and noticed the lead-colored clouds. She looked puzzled and wanted to say something, but suddenly her eyebrows furrowed, and she shouted loudly to Han Li, "Stone Dao friend, be careful!"

As soon as she spoke, a strong gust of wind rushed towards them.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and he saw a massive demon-slaying mallet flying towards him from the front, about to strike him down.

The mallet was covered in yin energy and emitted a rolling black smoke, with a cluster of dark purple phosphorus fire at its tip.

Han Li stomped his feet on the ground, showing no intention of dodging the incoming mallet. Instead, he charged forward, meeting the mallet head-on.

His speed was extremely fast, and in an instant, he reached the mallet.

But instead of trying to deflect the mallet with force, he sidestepped and directly wrapped his hands around the falling mallet, twisting his waist to change its direction.

The seemingly unstoppable mallet was suddenly reversed, and Han Li used his hands to send it flying back towards the Tianwang statue.

The Tianwang statue saw this and quickly swung its fist to block the mallet.

Han Li didn't stop, and instead, he activated the Tianxia Town Prison Gong, using his powerful energy to blast the mallet forward.

The mallet shattered the Tianwang statue's fist, sending shards of stone flying everywhere, and then pierced through its chest, causing another explosion. A burst of starlight shot out from the statue's broken body, reducing it to dust.

Another Tianwang statue arrived, swinging its mallet towards Han Li, but he easily dodged it.

Han Li's feet lightly touched the mallet, and he used the momentum to flash past the Tianwang statue's arm, quickly reaching its shoulder.

He grasped the edge of the Tianwang statue's helmet and swung himself to its chest, punching its face with a loud "Bam!"

The statue's evil face was shattered, and its mud-plastered fragments fell off, revealing a massive empty cavity. Inside, a dense and intense yin energy was condensing, with two points of ghostly fire flickering.

Han Li's mouth curled into a smile, and he reached into the cavity, pulling out the hidden ghost creature.

He dragged the creature to the top of the statue and looked up at the sky, laughing loudly, "You're quite patient, aren't you?"

As he spoke, he spread his fingers, and a burst of golden electricity shot out, incinerating the ghost creature.

The dark clouds in the sky remained motionless, but the ten red-robed ghost generals looked at each other, their expressions changing. Some of them were enraged, and they seemed to be preparing to pursue Han Li.

However, the Tian Shui sect's disciples were able to hold them back, preventing them from escaping.

"Since you're not willing to show yourself, I'll have to force you," Han Li said, his eyes cold.

As he spoke, he grasped a sword gesture, and his hand shot out, summoning the eighteen bamboo swords that were stuck in the ground. They trembled and flew back to Han Li, hovering around him.

The swords were surrounded by a faint glow, and more swords began to appear, totaling thirty-six swords.

The flying swords hummed, their surfaces crackling with electricity, as they prepared to strike.

"Go!"
Han Li's hands changed the spell incantation, and he let out a loud roar.

The 36 bamboo sword spirits received the command, and immediately emitted a joyful sword hum, wrapped in a blue light, and flew towards the dark clouds in the sky.

Under the sky, the flying swords stirred up a brilliant sword light, and outside the main sword bodies, countless faint blue sword lights were stirred up, gathering together to form a majestic blue sword dragon that pierced the leaden clouds.

"Ahh..."

A clear and melodious dragon's roar seemed to echo, and the blue sword dragon plunged into the dense cloud sea, disappearing without a trace.

After a moment of silence, a thunderous roar shook the heavens.

"Rumble, rumble..."

A dazzling golden light burst out from the cloud sea, and countless golden lightning bolts scattered and rushed about, forming massive golden lightning whips that swept across the surroundings, striking relentlessly.

The dark creatures on the square looked up at the sky, their faces filled with terror, and let out a chorus of wails.

The ten red-robed ghost generals were also pale with fear, their faces revealing a mixture of shock and awe.

The Exorcism God Thunder's natural dominance over these dark creatures was evident in this moment.

Su Zhongyan looked at Han Li's figure, a hint of surprise flashing in her eyes, while Jing Liu's face changed from shock to amazement, seemingly astonished by Han Li's sudden display of power.

They had thought that this "Stone Daoist" was at most a gold immortal with a decent survival skill, but now it seemed that his power was far beyond that of a ordinary Taiyi realm jade immortal.

Han Li gazed up at the sky, his brow furrowed, and his eyes no longer held the previous carefree expression.

"Hehehe..." A strange, teeth-grinding laugh echoed from the leaden clouds.

The countless ghosts heard the sound and became restless.

"Welcome, Wusuo Ghost King..." the red-robed ghost generals shouted in unison.

Su Zhongyan and Jing Liu heard the name and their faces changed suddenly, exclaiming in unison, "How can it be him?"

The others, including the people from the Tian Shui Sect, were equally perplexed, having never heard of such a ghost in the Jin Yuan Immortal Realm.

"How can it be him? He shouldn't be here, shouldn't he be in the Heavenly Prison?" Han Li was equally puzzled.

He wasn't entirely unfamiliar with the name Wusuo Ghost King, as he had collected information about the prisoners in the Heavenly Prison through the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall, including some of the most notorious ones.

Wusuo Ghost King was one of them.

At this moment, the dense leaden clouds in the sky began to churn and boil, then rapidly condensed into a black fog.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, gazing at the fog, but it was too dense to see anything. After a long time, he felt a strange sensation, as if he was about to be swallowed up.

He activated his Body Refining Technique, and his expression returned to normal.

"You're not bad, kid, but you're not dead yet. If you were, I'd give you a seat in the Ten Halls of the Underworld. But who knows, maybe you'll be dead soon?" a hoarse voice echoed from within the fog.

A figure emerged from the fog, a middle-aged man dressed in a Confucian robe, wearing a square hat.

His features were ordinary, but his eyes had a hint of a scholar's calmness, and his body was clean and free of any ghostly aura. Anyone who saw him would think he was just a harmless scholar, not the King of the Ghosts.

Han Li knew that this person was indeed Wusuo Ghost King.

According to legend, Wusuo Ghost King was once a mortal scholar who had failed to pass the imperial exams, and after a series of misfortunes, he had risen up in rebellion against the kingdom. His rebel army had swept across the land, and he had used the infamous "human livestock" method to feed his troops.

The kingdom had been on the brink of collapse, and the immortal sects had intervened, violating the taboo against interfering with mortal affairs. Wusuo Ghost King had been defeated and killed, but his spirit had lingered, and he had eventually become a powerful ghost.

Through various means, he had avoided numerous heavenly disasters and had continued to cultivate, eventually becoming a ghost immortal and reaching the level of a Da Luo Ghost King.

But why had he been suppressed in this place?
