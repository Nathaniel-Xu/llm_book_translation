Shui Chang Tian seemed to have anticipated Han Li's appearance, and with a single hand, he slapped a palm down towards him. However, despite the speed and terrifying force of the palm, it still struck empty air.

Han Li's figure vanished like a ghost, and then reappeared silently behind Shui Chang Tian.

A massive, three-headed, six-armed divine body suddenly materialized, with six enormous arms containing terrifying force, spinning like a windmill.

In an instant, the air was filled with the sound of drums, as countless fist shadows densely fell, crazily pounding Shui Chang Tian's body.

"Boom boom boom..."

A series of deafening thunderclaps echoed, as a series of shockwaves exploded, and Shui Chang Tian, under the relentless fist shadows, was unable to even escape, his blue water armor shattering, his massive body collapsing like a mountain, sending up countless sand particles.

The atmosphere was deadly silent, with only the sound of fist shadows falling.

Shui Chang Tian's body was surrounded by a fierce mist, as he emitted a series of white smoke, covering a radius of tens of thousands of miles.

Zi Ling and the others, who had been fighting on the periphery, stopped and looked over, drawn in by the terrifying commotion.

After a long time, the drumming sound finally gradually faded away.

In the vast white mist, Han Li's figure had returned to normal, with a broken and battered corpse lying at his feet.

Shui Chang Tian's divine body was no match for Han Li's physical strength, which had reached the pinnacle of perfection.

After a flurry of punches, Han Li's pent-up emotions finally dissipated.

He bent down to pick up a storage ring from beneath the corpse, glanced around at the dispersing mist, and suddenly smiled.

"Unexpectedly, you still had this trick up your sleeve."

His words had barely fallen when the surrounding void distorted, and a series of narrow streets and alleys began to materialize, with buildings and shops rising up on either side.

In the blink of an eye, Han Li found himself in a mundane city.

The streets were filled with people, carriages, and horses, as well as various sounds of hawking and peddling. Even the savory smell of meat wafting from a nearby baozi shop reached Han Li's nostrils.

"A great hiding place, you half-soul, you're quite skilled at hiding."

Han Li smiled, and then suddenly opened his mouth, blowing a powerful gust of wind towards the front.

The buildings and streets around him shattered like a dream, dispersing into a cloud of smoke.

Han Li's gaze immediately fell upon Shui Chang Tian's fleeing soul, which had escaped to a distance of tens of thousands of miles.

He raised his hand, and a golden sword light, wrapped in the power of time, shot out, disappearing into the distance.

A blood-curdling scream echoed, as Shui Chang Tian's soul was completely annihilated.

The monitoring and patrolling celestial messengers who had followed him fled in terror, without daring to linger.

Shi Chuan Kong and Zi Ling also flew towards Han Li, without intercepting the fleeing messengers.

At this time, the divine power of Fa Yan Tian Di had reached its limit, and the yellow sand began to dissipate, revealing the sea floor once more.

The seawater, which had been blocked by the battle's aftermath, began to flow back, filling the newly formed trenches and canyons.

Han Li's figure moved, and he flew towards Zi Ling, reuniting with her.

"Today's battle, I finally understand just how powerful you've become..." Zi Ling said, her eyes wide with amazement.

Han Li remained silent for a moment, before responding, "It's not enough."

"I didn't expect that upon returning to the True Immortal Realm, we would be ambushed by the Heavenly Court. It seems that the days ahead won't be peaceful." Shi Chuan Kong said, his expression worried.

"We had already anticipated this, didn't we? Do you have any plans?" Han Li asked, his tone light.

"Now that things have settled, I plan to return to the Demon Realm." Shi Chuan Kong sighed.

"With your identity, it's safer for you to return to the Demon Realm, considering the turmoil in the True Immortal Realm." Han Li nodded.

"Han friend, you're being pursued by the Heavenly Court, why not take refuge in the Demon Realm for a while? You don't know, but Crab Uncle has left the Accumulated Scales Boundary, and is marching into the Demon Realm, occupying nearly half of the realm. You'll be safe there, and won't have to worry about being pursued." Shi Chuan Kong said.

"No need, I'm not concerned about the Heavenly Court's pursuit. I don't want to get entangled in other conflicts, I just want to find a place to cultivate in peace." Han Li said, his eyes gleaming with a hint of depth.

Shi Chuan Kong's heart felt a bit awkward, as he had indeed invited Han Li to return to the Demon Realm with the intention of recruiting him as an ally.

"Since Han friend has his own plans, I won't force the issue. Zi Ling, what are your plans? Will you return to the Demon Realm, or..." Shi Chuan Kong turned to Zi Ling, who looked at Han Li, seeming to seek his opinion.
"Zi Ling, I just said that the True Immortal Realm is currently in turmoil, and your strength is not strong, so it's better for you to return to the Demon Domain with Shi Dao friend," Han Li said with a slight pause.

"What about you?" Zi Ling stared at Han Li's eyes.

"Yu'er is currently in the Reincarnation Hall, I naturally want to bring her back," Han Li's eyes flashed with a sharp light.

"You want to go to the Reincarnation Hall again?" Zi Ling's eyebrows wrinkled in concern.

"Brother Han, the Reincarnation Hall's power is extremely strong, even the Heavenly Court's power cannot eliminate it, and the Reincarnation Hall Master's divine power, we have all witnessed it, Brother Han's strength is strong, but compared to the Reincarnation Hall Master, it's still far inferior, don't be impulsive," Shi Chuan Kong's expression was also shocked, and he hurriedly advised.

"I won't act rashly, I mean in the future. First, I'll improve my cultivation, at least reach the late stage of the Great Luo Realm, and then make plans," Han Li said.

The three great ultimate laws are not trivial, and challenging across levels is a common thing.

The Reincarnation Hall Master is only in the late stage of the Great Luo Realm, and has not reached the realm of the Dao Ancestor, but can instantly kill the Bone Emperor, a Dao Ancestor.

The deeper Han Li cultivates the Time Law, the more he feels its power, and he has a feeling that once he reaches the late stage of the Great Luo Realm, his strength will be elevated again.

"I'll accompany you," Zi Ling suddenly spoke up.

"Zi Ling, my side is not safe, you should..." Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and he said again.

"In the past, whether in the Mortal Realm or the Spiritual Realm, I couldn't accompany you, it's always been my greatest regret, now that I finally have the opportunity, let me accompany you!" Zi Ling interrupted Han Li's words, her eyes reflecting Han Li's image.

Han Li was silent for a moment, then nodded.

From the moment they met, he had never been able to accompany Zi Ling, and he felt extremely guilty.

Zi Ling heard this and smiled brightly, and the surrounding void seemed to become gentle.

"Since Zi Ling Dao friend has decided to stay, then Shi will return to the Demon Domain alone, I'll explain to Crab Uncle, you two be careful on your journey," Shi Chuan Kong glanced at Zi Ling, then looked at Han Li, his eyes flashing with a hint of unintentional loss, and he clasped his fist.

"Take care," Han Li clasped his fist in response.

Shi Chuan Kong looked at Han Li and Zi Ling again, and his gaze lingered on Zi Ling for a moment, before his body transformed into a silver light and disappeared.

Shi Chuan Kong's gaze was subtle, but with Han Li and Zi Ling's cultivation level, how could they not see it?

"Shi Dao friend assisted me greatly in the Demon Domain, but I don't have any relationship with him," Zi Ling said softly.

"Of course, I wouldn't doubt you," Han Li smiled faintly.

Zi Ling heard this and relaxed.

The surrounding situation returned to calm, with only the waves gently lapping.

"This place is not suitable for staying for long, let's go," Han Li said, looking around.

Before he finished speaking, he waved his hand and sent a golden light to envelop Zi Ling, and they shot up into the sky, flying straight towards the high altitude.

"Brother Han, where are we going?" Zi Ling asked in surprise.

"We're going to the outside of the heavens," Han Li smiled faintly, and the golden light around him intensified, increasing their speed, and they soon passed through the Qing Ming Domain and arrived at the Tian Feng Domain.

Endless winds assailed them, shocking the heavens.

Zi Ling's cultivation was not strong, and seeing this, her face revealed a hint of fear.

But Han Li didn't pay attention to the winds, and instead explained the three great domains to Zi Ling as they continued forward.

The golden light around him flashed, and a circle of golden ripples spread out, calming the winds that entered their range.

Han Li easily traversed the endless winds, without encountering any danger, and their speed didn't decrease at all.

Zi Ling saw this and felt at ease, looking at Han Li with a hint of admiration.

Before long, they passed through the Tian Feng Domain and arrived at the outside of the heavens.

The black void, countless asteroids, and chaotic primordial energy storms left Zi Ling speechless, her eyes wide with wonder.

"I never thought the outside of the heavens would be like this, it's truly broadening my horizons, but what are we doing here?" Zi Ling finally recovered, her expression still filled with surprise.

"Naturally, we're here to close up and cultivate, the Heavenly Court and the Reincarnation Hall's power is extremely vast, and if there are Dao Ancestor-level people searching, no matter where we hide, there's a danger of being discovered. The outside of the heavens is located in the endless high altitude, infinite and boundless, only here can we not worry about being found," Han Li said.

"I see, but this place looks like it's full of crises, and it's extremely easy to change... can we really find a place to close up and cultivate in peace?" Zi Ling asked, her expression concerned.

"Don't worry, leave it to me," Han Li smiled, and brought Zi Ling forward, his vast divine sense spreading out, sensing the surroundings.

As they flew deeper into the void, the stars and asteroids whizzed by, and the primordial energy storms raged on, but Han Li's divine sense remained calm, guiding them through the chaos.
