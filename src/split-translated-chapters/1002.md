Jin Chuan suddenly waved his sleeve, and under the scorching sun, countless rain threads suddenly appeared in the air, densely covering the area within a thousand meters of Han Li.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he saw that the seemingly weak rain threads contained a faint purple glow.

"It's poisonous..."

He thought to himself, and with a swift motion, he punched out with one hand.

The fist was covered in a layer of white starlight, which repelled the rain threads and sent them flying back a hundred meters, disappearing into the air.

Han Li was about to jump into the air and pursue when he suddenly felt his feet being restrained, and he couldn't move.

He looked down and saw that a layer of blue water had gathered around his feet, swirling around his legs and binding them tightly.

The blue water had a faint jade-like luster, and within it, he could see a series of strange patterns that seemed to be infused with the power of the water element.

Han Li lifted his legs, but they felt incredibly heavy, as if they were rooted to the ground.

"Tao, my water binding technique is connected to the underground water veins. To break free, he would have to contend with hundreds of underground rivers. He won't be able to escape in an instant. You must act quickly and..."

Jin Chuan's voice was cut off, and his face contorted in shock.

A figure suddenly appeared before him, and Han Li's body was surrounded by a surge of blood and flesh power.

His body glowed with a crimson light, and his nine hundred or so acupoints shone brightly as he unleashed the full power of his heavenly suppression technique.

Jin Chuan's eyes widened in horror as Han Li's fist struck the air, creating a shockwave that seemed to shatter the very fabric of reality.

Han Li's fist hit the water screen, but he felt a strange power pulling him back, as if his fist had missed its mark. His strength was unable to penetrate the water screen and reach Jin Chuan's chest.

"Now! Quickly!" Jin Chuan shouted.

As soon as he spoke, Tao's figure appeared behind Han Li, surrounded by a halo of flames. He made a hand seal and shouted:

"Go!"

The golden flying sword shot out, and its nine seals glowed brightly. The sword's power surged, and it seemed to rival that of a fifth-grade immortal treasure.

The sword was about to strike Han Li when a golden light erupted from his body, and a golden wheel appeared, spinning rapidly as it released a beam of golden light that enveloped the surrounding area.

The flying sword's speed slowed as it entered the golden light, and it seemed to be suspended in mid-air.

The sword's flames raged wildly, burning away the golden light, but it couldn't break free from the golden wheel's restraint.

Tao's face was filled with shock and disbelief as he watched the scene unfold.

Jin Chuan, who was closest to the action, was frozen in place, his eyes wide with terror.

"It seems you're not as formidable as I thought. You've truly disappointed me..." Han Li sighed, and his body began to glow with a crimson light.

His body expanded, and he transformed into a three-headed, six-armed figure. His three heads were those of a golden ape, a dragon, and a giant bird, each one a manifestation of his true spirit bloodline.

One of his fists was still trapped by the water screen, but his other hand, which was covered in golden scales, burst forth and pierced the water screen, reaching into Jin Chuan's chest and grasping his heart.

Han Li didn't even look at the heart as he crushed it with his fingers.

Jin Chuan's body began to crumble, and his soul was torn from his body.

At the same time, Han Li's body turned, and his two lower hands grasped the golden flying sword, which was still trying to break free from the golden wheel's restraint.

A surge of intense heat flowed through his body, and Han Li felt his blood boiling, as if it was about to erupt. The sensation was similar to the backlash of his true spirit bloodline.

Han Li sneered, unfazed, and his two hands, which were covered in fine scales, grasped the sword tightly, enduring the intense flames that engulfed them.

With a swift motion, he twisted the sword, and it let out a deafening screech as it struggled to break free from Han Li's grasp.
The massive power unleashed by the three true spirit bloodlines - the Mountainous Giant Ape, the True Dragon, and the Kunpeng - under the stimulation of the Heaven's Punishment Seal, was not something that a mere five or six-grade immortal sword could withstand.

As a metallic ringing sound echoed, the flame-wrapped flying sword began to twist and deform, finally letting out a loud explosion and shattering into pieces.

The surrounding flames shot out in all directions, and the intense heat waves rolled and churned, scorching the massive Kunpeng hand that Han Li had transformed into, releasing a pungent smell of charred flesh.

Han Li casually tossed the hand aside, his body flashing with a bloody glow as he returned to his human form, a smile spreading across his face as he gazed out at Tao Ji in the distance.

Tao Ji had already spat out a mouthful of blood and turned to flee at the moment the flying sword shattered, his body erupting with a fiery blaze that left a trail of flames in his wake, like a fire arrow shooting off into the distance.

However, Han Li's Time Domain had already enveloped the surrounding hundred-mile radius, and although Tao Ji was only a hundred or so yards away, he was still bound by the golden light of the True Speech Treasure Wheel, and even if he managed to temporarily break free using some secret technique, his movements were still sluggish.

"It's too late to try and escape now!" Han Li's voice fell, and he immediately retracted the Treasure Wheel into his body, reversing his momentum.

At the same time, he lifted his foot and heavily stomped the ground, his body bursting forth with a sudden explosion of speed, vanishing into the air as a silver electric light enveloped him.

Tao Ji's eyes widened in shock as he realized Han Li had disappeared, his divine sense unable to accurately lock onto Han Li's position, his face pale with fear.

He could no longer afford to hesitate, and with a swift motion, he formed a hand seal and activated his Burning Blood Technique, his speed increasing by a factor of two as he fled in a distant direction.

"Tao Long, why are you leaving so soon? Didn't you just say you wanted to destroy my soul?" Han Li's voice echoed through the air, and a flash of electric light appeared beside Tao Ji.

Tao Ji's eyes were wide with terror, and he didn't dare respond, fleeing for his life.

Han Li, however, seemed to be toying with him, keeping pace with Tao Ji as he spoke, "If it weren't for Tao Yue's deception and attempt on my life when I first arrived in the immortal realm, forcing me to the brink of death, you and your son wouldn't be in this predicament today. You have no one to blame but yourself for not teaching him properly..."

Tao Ji's eyes turned red with rage, the Burning Blood Technique pushed to its limits, but he still couldn't shake Han Li off his tail.

"However, I, Han Li, am a man of my word, and I don't have the same hobby as you do, of refining human souls into lanterns. I simply kept Tao Yue's soul with me for a while, playing with it... if only you had found him back then..."

Tao Ji's anger finally boiled over, and he stopped fleeing, his body erupting with a massive blaze of flames as he confronted Han Li.

The flames enveloped the surrounding area, and the temperature skyrocketed, but Han Li had already retreated to a safe distance, his eyes fixed on the explosion's center.

A deafening boom shook the air as a massive explosion erupted, sending a wave of flames and heat crashing out in all directions.

Han Li, however, simply smiled coldly, his eyes gleaming with a deep purple light.

"Despicable trick!" Han Li's voice echoed through the air, and he charged forward, his body bursting forth with a sudden explosion of speed.

As he approached the center of the explosion, he noticed that the flames contained a faint, weak power, unlike the true power of a self-destructing technique.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he spotted hundreds of fist-sized flames, all converging on a single point, merging into a single, massive blaze.

Han Li's lips curled into a smile, and with a swift motion, he pointed forward, unleashing a wave of eighteen cyan-colored flying swords that shot towards the flames, dispelling them with a burst of golden light.

The flames dissipated, and Han Li's eyes landed on a single flying sword, which had a small, green glow emanating from it - a storage ring.

"Wanting to feign death and escape, yet you couldn't even bring yourself to destroy your storage ring... you really don't have the courage to do it properly." Han Li's voice dripped with amusement as he retrieved the storage ring.

With a wave of his hand, he recalled the flying swords, and with a final glance at the area, he turned and flew back to clean up the battlefield in the nearby mountains.

A long time later, a small, flickering flame appeared on the crown of an ancient tree in the forest below, dancing in the wind before disappearing into the distance.
