Although it's said that way, I know that this Hundred Ghost Forest is extremely perilous, and we're not familiar with it. Rushing through blindly might be too reckless, don't you think? Shi Chuan Kong frowned and said.

"How much do you know about the Hundred Ghost Forest, Shi?" Han Li asked.

"I don't know much, but I've heard that there are many Wild Souls within the Hundred Ghost Forest, and they're extremely difficult to deal with," Shi Chuan Kong replied.

"What are Wild Souls?" Han Li asked.

Tixi, Jintong, and Ziling also looked at Shi Chuan Kong, clearly hearing the term for the first time.

"The transmigration of souls is limited to a certain number of times, but it's not absolute. Some souls have exceptional innate abilities or have experienced special circumstances, allowing them to persist even after exceeding the limit. After a long period of time, they evolve into Wild Souls. Although they're still souls, they have no rationality, only a desire for slaughter, making them very difficult to deal with. The Hundred Ghost Forest's unique environment has made it a gathering place for Wild Souls, making it extremely dangerous," Shi Chuan Kong said solemnly.

"Wild Souls may be formidable, but they're still just souls. I think we should be able to handle them easily, and it's better than facing the vast numbers of the Underworld," Tixi said.

"I agree, with Tixi here, those souls shouldn't be a problem," Jintong added.

"Since the three of you think it's better to go through the Hundred Ghost Forest, let's take this route," Shi Chuan Kong said, nodding.

"Then let's set off," Han Li said.

The group decided and immediately flew into the Hundred Ghost Forest.

The forest was shrouded in dim light, with mist swirling around, making it difficult to see more than a few dozen meters ahead. Fortunately, their spiritual senses allowed them to perceive their surroundings freely, and they weren't greatly affected.

The group's cultivation was strong, and as they traversed the unfamiliar forest, they seemed like faint, elusive silhouettes.

Han Li flew at the front, his eyes gleaming with a purple-black light as he closely monitored the surroundings.

Suddenly, a black light shot out from the nearby dense forest, and a small, black, double-headed snake darted towards Han Li's leg, its speed astonishing.

However, a golden light flashed beside Han Li, and a golden thread flashed by, splitting the snake's body in two. The snake's black blood splattered, and the ground nearby began to sizzle and emit a green smoke.

The snake's two halves twisted a few times before becoming still.

The group had already disappeared into the distance.

"It seems that the Hundred Ghost Forest doesn't just have Wild Souls, but also many ferocious ghost beasts, and the toxins within their bodies are likely to be deadly even to us. Everyone should be cautious," Shi Chuan Kong said, following closely behind Han Li, looking back.

The others nodded seriously.

They had just entered the forest, and the first danger they encountered was already so severe. What other dangers lay deeper within?

Time passed slowly, and after a fortnight, the group had gradually delved deeper into the Hundred Ghost Forest, encountering more and more ghost beasts, including groups and even those with cultivation levels reaching the Taiyi realm.

The group avoided confrontations whenever possible, but when they couldn't, they worked together to eliminate the threats with powerful methods, to avoid causing more trouble.

Half a month later, on a certain day, a black river flowed nearby, accompanied by thunderous roars, wails, and screams that echoed for miles.

However, the sounds soon subsided, and the surroundings returned to silence.

The area around the river was in disarray, with massive cracks in the ground, some stretching for dozens of miles, and numerous deep pits emitting green smoke.

Han Li and the others stood by the river, surrounded by a large number of black, wolf-like ghost beasts, nearly ten thousand in number.

These wolf-like ghost beasts were seven to eight meters long, with thick bodies covered in black, hard fur, and long, sharp teeth. They looked extremely ferocious.

However, the ghost beasts' bodies were either split in two or had their heads, chests, or other vital areas pierced, and they had all fallen, their black blood flowing.

The ghost beasts' blood was highly corrosive, and the nearby ground had turned a dark, charred color, as if burned by flames.

Han Li, Tixi, and Shi Chuan Kong looked unscathed, but Ziling and Jintong had slightly pale faces.

These wolf-like ghost beasts were not weak, especially since they could unleash a powerful soul attack, and their numbers were staggering. Ziling and Jintong, with their weaker souls, had taken some damage.

"Are you two alright?" Han Li asked, looking at them.

"I'm fine," Jintong forced a smile.

Ziling took a deep breath and shook her head.

"These ghost beasts' soul attacks are nothing compared to the Wild Souls', according to the records. We're still on the outskirts of the Hundred Ghost Forest, so we haven't encountered any Wild Souls yet. As we venture deeper, we'll soon meet them. If you can't handle it, don't force yourselves," Shi Chuan Kong said.

Ziling and Jintong nodded, not trying to be brave.

The group didn't linger and continued on their journey.

"Ziling, I didn't get to ask you earlier, how have you been in the Demon Realm these past few years?" Han Li asked, approaching Ziling.

"..."
Fortunately, with the help of Crab Senior and Shi Dao friend, I haven't suffered in these years, just cultivating diligently every day." Zi Ling replied.

"Speaking of cultivation, I've been away from the Demon Realm for less than a thousand years, and your cultivation has reached this level, it's truly astonishing." Han Li said.

"It's all thanks to Crab Senior, he set up a special space for me to cultivate, and my progress has been extremely rapid... and the things you left me back then have also been of great help to my cultivation." Zi Ling said.

"Crab Dao friend..." Han Li murmured.

With Crab Dao friend, a Demon Realm's Dao Ancestor, helping Zi Ling to increase her cultivation, it's not a difficult task.

"How is Crab Dao friend doing now? Is he still in the Accumulating Scales Realm?" Han Li asked after a pause.

"Crab Senior..." Zi Ling was about to respond, but Han Li suddenly raised his hand to stop her.

His face turned serious, and he looked forward, his flying body also stopped.

Shi Chuan Kong, Ti Hun, and the others also stopped, their expressions extremely solemn.

Zi Ling also quickly looked forward, her face changing.

In front of them, a pale white mist emerged from the forest, rapidly drifting towards them. Wherever it passed, the ground and trees were covered in a layer of ice.

A fierce and terrifying aura emanated from the depths of the white mist, causing even the powerful cultivators present to feel a chill.

"It's a Desolate Soul... and it's not a small one, at least it's a thousand years old, everyone be careful!" Shi Chuan Kong said in a low voice.

Before he finished speaking, the white mist suddenly churned violently, and countless white winds burst out, transforming into a massive white storm.

The nearby forest was instantly engulfed by the white storm, exploding into powder, and the ground was also scraped away.

The white storm swept towards them like a mountain, with eerie wails and howls coming from within, piercing the ears.

Shi Chuan Kong heard the sound, and his divine soul began to fluctuate uncontrollably, his demonic energy surging out of control. The protective spirit light on his body rapidly dimmed.

His face changed, and he quickly retreated, suppressing the turmoil in his divine soul.

Ti Hun, Jin Tong, and the others heard the wails, and their divine souls also began to fluctuate wildly, quickly retreating.

But in the midst of the howling winds, a brilliant golden light suddenly appeared, and Han Li didn't retreat with the others. Instead, he stood still, surrounded by a golden light halo, gazing at the approaching white storm. His eyes flashed with purple-black light.

"Master!" Ti Hun saw this scene and immediately panicked, stopping in his tracks and turning to rush back.

"Wait, Uncle isn't acting impulsively, he must have his reasons. And it's just one, Uncle can definitely handle it." Jin Tong grabbed Ti Hun's arm.

Zi Ling saw Han Li's actions and also stopped, her face filled with concern.

The white storm rushed towards Han Li, covering him like a giant mouth, as if swallowing him whole.

Han Li's body remained still, the golden light on him not dimming, but instead growing stronger. A hazy aura formed in front of him, blocking the white storm.

A dull explosion sounded.

The white storm was halted just a few feet away from the golden aura, unable to advance.

A deafening roar echoed from the depths of the white storm.

A fierce and terrifying killing intent surged forth, causing even Shi Chuan Kong and the others to feel a chill.

"Foolish! You've hidden your true body, but you've revealed your power." Han Li seemed unaffected, coldly snorting.

He raised his right hand, and a brilliant golden light burst forth. A golden rainbow shot out from his hand, piercing into the white storm.

The churning white storm suddenly stopped, then exploded with a loud crash, dispersing into scattered mist.

A massive white ghostly creature emerged, its body over a hundred feet tall, yet impossibly thin, like a bamboo pole.

The ghostly creature wore a long white robe, with long fingernails on its hands, and a long tongue that flailed about in its mouth, resembling a hanged ghost from folklore.

An enormous ghostly aura emanated from the creature, surpassing Shi Chuan Kong, Ti Hun, and the others, rivaling the Blood Fiend from before.

The white ghostly creature's chest was pierced by the golden rainbow, creating a massive hole.

The creature looked down at the hole, its face filled with incredulity.

Shi Chuan Kong and the others saw this scene, their faces also filled with incredulity.

Han Li raised his arm, and the golden rainbow slashed upwards, tearing the creature's upper body in two.

The creature's body exploded, turning into a massive cloud of white smoke, which dispersed in all directions.

Within the smoke, numerous ghostly light orbs could be seen, each emitting a powerful ghostly aura, as if they were living creatures flying about.
