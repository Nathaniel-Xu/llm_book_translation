Sun Daoist, weren't you killed by Lianyan?" The black-robed youth's face was filled with shock as he saw the old man.

"Two of you..." The white-robed female nun's face also showed surprise, and then she remembered the gray-robed old man's words. Her expression suddenly changed.

She transformed into a white shadow and shot towards the side. A thin red light grazed her body but didn't hit her.

A thin red light also appeared behind the black-robed youth, piercing through his chest.

With a loud "bang," the black-robed youth's chest exploded, and fresh blood sprayed from his mouth. He fell to the ground, his breathing chaotic.

Behind the two, the red-robed woman lowered her hand, her face expressionless. Her hands still had remnants of the red light.

"You're in cahoots with each other!" The white-robed female nun's shadow flashed, appearing several hundred feet away. Her eyebrows were inverted as she shouted.

"Ha ha, Yu Xianzi is indeed clever, but this is my territory. You can struggle all you want, but it's useless." The gray-robed old man smiled faintly and raised his hand.

The array patterns on the six stone pillars surrounding the square suddenly lit up, and a sharp, shrill sound filled the air. Countless dark red lights shot out from the pillars, weaving together into a massive light net that descended towards the white-robed female nun.

At the same time, a giant, grotesque face appeared on one of the stone pillars, its mouth open wide. It spat out a dark red light that enveloped the black-robed youth on the ground.

The black-robed youth, who had been trying to struggle, was immediately immobilized by the light.

The white-robed female nun's face changed as she saw this scene. She shot towards the outside of the square, and her body was surrounded by a purple electric glow that expanded rapidly, forming a purple lightning spirit domain.

Innumerable purple electric snakes swirled within the domain, and the electric arcs at the center of the vortex were blindingly bright.

A thunderous roar filled the air!

The purple lightning within the domain suddenly gathered at the center of the vortex, and in the next instant, a blinding lightning sword shot out, carrying boundless power as it struck the dark red light net.

The dark red light net was torn apart, and the white-robed female nun flew out from the spirit domain, about to escape through the opening.

"You underestimate me, but what use is your spirit domain here?" The gray-robed old man raised an eyebrow, then laughed and stretched out his hand.

A dark red mountain peak suddenly appeared in the sky, pressing down on the spirit domain. The domain shattered, and the white-robed female nun's body was frozen in place before plummeting to the ground.

The stone pillar nearest to her displayed a giant, grotesque face that spat out a dark red light, enveloping the white-robed female nun's body.

A strange power emanated from the light, and the white-robed female nun's body became immobile, just like the black-robed youth.

The gray-robed old man slowly descended, standing on the square. The red-robed woman also landed beside him, her face expressionless and wooden, like a puppet.

"Sun Chongshan, this is all your doing, isn't it? You've been plotting to lure us into this space. What do you plan to do?" The white-robed female nun looked at the red-robed woman, her voice stern.

The gray-robed old man ignored the white-robed female nun's question and waved his hand. A black storage ring and a green snake sword appeared before him, belonging to the three-eyed man.

At the same time, the white-robed female nun and the black-robed youth's storage devices flew out, landing in the gray-robed old man's hands.

"Excellent, excellent, a great harvest!" The old man's eyes gleamed with excitement as he examined the storage devices.

"You want to murder us for our wealth? Don't forget, the Day and Night Divine Vessel has strict regulations. Boarding and disembarking require verification of each room's occupants. You can't kill us here and expect to escape punishment from the Day and Night Alliance." The white-robed female nun's face darkened.

The black-robed youth's face also turned pale.

"Hehe, Yu Xianzi, don't worry. I won't kill you, but I'll turn you into the puppet spirits of the Nine-Nine Yan Luo Array. From the outside, you'll look no different from before, just like this." The gray-robed old man sneered, then pointed his finger.

Another stone pillar displayed a giant, grotesque face that spat out a light, which enveloped the ground. The three-eyed man's corpse appeared, and then was sucked into the ghostly face's mouth.

The ghostly face chewed for a moment, and then spat out the three-eyed man, who looked identical to before, with the same aura and expression. However, his eyes were dull and lifeless, just like the red-robed woman.

"How's that? Will the Day and Night Alliance discover any flaws?" The gray-robed old man laughed smugly.
“Ah, this is indeed a remarkable method, truly eye-opening.” A voice suddenly appeared, echoing through the square.

“Who is that?” The gray-robed old man’s face changed color, his eyes scanning the surroundings as he rapidly made hand seals, seemingly urging something into action.

However, there was no unusual occurrence in the surroundings, and instead, the dark red glow enveloping the white-robed female nun and the black-robed young man suddenly flashed and disappeared.

The light from the array patterns on the stone pillars surrounding the square also flashed and extinguished, and the massive blood-red peak in the air vanished, restoring the dark red space to calmness.

The white-robed female nun and the black-robed young man hastily stood up, looking around in all directions.

“How is this possible? The Yama Tripod is mine! I had already completed the ritual, how could it be taken away from me?” The gray-robed old man’s face contorted in a fierce scowl, his voice hoarse with rage.

He made vigorous hand seals, but the surrounding space did not respond in the slightest.

“Ah, this treasure is called the Yama Tripod? Not bad, not bad.” Two figures suddenly appeared in mid-air, Han Li and Qiuhun, slowly descending.

“Are you two! You dare to steal my Yama Tripod, you will die!” The gray-robed old man saw the two and hesitated for a moment, but his eyes soon turned blood-red, and he swung his hands wildly.

“Boom!” A loud explosion sounded!

Dozens of dazzling treasured lights shot out from his body, mostly high-grade immortal artifacts, as well as some powerful talismans, lightning pearls, and fire pearls, all hurtling towards Han Li.

Standing beside Han Li, Qiuhun stepped forward, his body radiating a blinding black light. With a single push, a massive black light sphere, dozens of meters in size, shot out, enveloping the gray-robed old man’s immortal artifacts and talismans.

Those immortal artifacts and talismans slowed down, as if trapped in a quagmire, unable to move.

Qiuhun then raised his sleeve, and the black light sphere, along with the objects inside, flew into his sleeve, disappearing without a trace.

“Who...who are you two?” The gray-robed old man’s face turned pale, his voice trembling with fear.

The white-robed female nun and the black-robed young man, witnessing this scene, felt a sudden change in their expressions, sensing the unfathomable aura emanating from Han Li and Qiuhun.

“With your cultivation, you possess so many immortal artifacts and treasures, it seems you have become quite skilled at killing and plundering.” Han Li glanced at the gray-robed old man, his voice detached.

The gray-robed old man’s face turned even paler, his body trembling uncontrollably.

“Thank you, esteemed seniors, for saving us.” The white-robed female nun and the black-robed young man hastily approached Han Li, bowing in gratitude.

Han Li glanced at the black-robed young man, raised his hand, and with a wave, the young man vanished, leaving the area.

The white-robed female nun, witnessing this, felt a slight tremble in her body, her expression becoming even more respectful.

People with extremely high cultivation often have peculiar habits, and it’s best not to offend them.

“What is your name?” Han Li walked towards the white-robed female nun, asking.

“Reporting to senior, my name is Yu Menghan.” Yu Menghan hastily replied.

“Looking at your aura, you are a cultivator from the lower realms who ascended to the immortal realm. Which realm did you ascend from?” Han Li asked, his voice calm.

Yu Menghan hesitated for a moment before answering, “Senior, I indeed ascended from the lower realms, and my origin is the Linghuan Realm.”

“Indeed, you are from the Linghuan Realm. You possess a unique aura from that realm, and I also have a connection to the Linghuan Realm. It seems we have a predestined relationship. I see that you have a considerable amount of Lei Yuan energy accumulated within you, likely due to consuming a certain heavenly treasure with lightning attributes. Unfortunately, your current cultivation method is not particularly impressive. I have a lightning-attribute cultivation method here, which I will gift to you, hoping you won’t waste this opportunity.” Han Li smiled faintly, handing Yu Menghan a purple jade slip.

The jade slip contained a lightning-based cultivation method from the “Five Thunder True Scripture.”

Yu Menghan was taken aback, feeling a sense of familiarity with the person before her, but couldn’t quite recall where she had met him before.

Han Li didn’t say anything else, raised his hand, and with a wave, Yu Menghan’s figure disappeared, leaving the area.

“That person isn’t your friend, Master? Why didn’t you reveal your true identity and meet with her?” Qiuhun’s voice echoed in Han Li’s mind.

“Times have changed, and now is not the time for me to reveal my true identity and meet with her. It’s better to settle this karma and let things be.” Han Li shook his head, his voice calm.

Qiuhun smiled faintly, not saying anything else.

Han Li turned his attention to the gray-robed old man, walking towards him.

“Senior... junior is guilty of countless crimes, and I was blinded by my own desires. I am willing to return the Yama Tripod to you, please give me a chance to redeem myself.” The gray-robed old man knelt down, kowtowing repeatedly.

“Don’t worry, I’m not here to seek revenge. Whatever wrongs you committed in the past have nothing to do with me. I have a few questions for you, answer them honestly, and I might spare your life.” Han Li said calmly.

He wasn’t a righteous cultivator, and he had committed his share of wrongdoings, but he only targeted those who had malicious intentions towards him, unlike the gray-robed old man, who killed for treasures.
