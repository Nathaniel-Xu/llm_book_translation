Han Li slowly withdrew his gaze and waved his hand, moving the Earth Immortal's body to the center of the Yin-Yang Fish Diagram, slightly off from the correct position.

He himself sat opposite the Earth Immortal's body, on the Yang Fish Diagram side, also slightly off from the correct position.

After sitting down, he began to calm his mind and regulate his breathing, making his entire body seem as if he had cast the "Myriad Apertures Empty Silence" technique, with all his aura sinking into stillness, almost indistinguishable from the Earth Immortal's body.

A moment later, the Golden Boy and the Wailing Spirit returned, each going to the north and south ends of the island to stand guard.

Han Li then focused his gaze, his hands forming a seal, and his mouth began to recite incantations.

Immediately, the outermost ring of symbols on the altar lit up with a golden glow, as if the sound of Buddhist chanting was resonating from within, spreading out in all directions and forming a half-spherical, solid light barrier that protected the entire altar.

On the surface of the light barrier, Buddhist scriptures appeared, flashing with brilliant golden light.

Next, the middle layer of curved symbols also lit up, and the seven or eight treasures placed on top of them shone brightly, rising into the air as pillars of light that pierced the heavens. Depending on their attributes, some were wrapped in raging flames, some condensed into icy cold air, and some were entwined with dense lightning, "crackling" with purple electricity.

"Whoosh, whoosh..."

As the sound of breaking air echoed, the pillars of light shot out chains of virtual light that were either icy, fiery, or electrified, piercing into the Earth Immortal's body at the major acupoints such as the Zhongzhong, Baihui, and Dantian.

These places were crucial points for the Evil Corpse to transform the Earth Immortal's body, and Han Li had to control them to prevent any accidents.

After the second layer of the formation, like a target, had pinned the Earth Immortal's body full of chains, the central Yin-Yang Fish Diagram finally lit up with a thin, black-and-white light.

Unlike the previous two layers, the third layer's symbol array only emitted a thin, faint glow.

Han Li gazed out at the altar and soon saw that the entire island was illuminated by pillars of light that condensed into a golden, glittering tower that suppressed the entire Tian Shuang Island.

Seeing that the Golden Boy and the Wailing Spirit had activated the "Treasured Tower Suppressing Demon Formation", Han Li took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and sank his divine sense into his spiritual sea.

His spiritual sea was now half-filled with dark clouds and half with a bloody, turbulent sea.

Ever since he had released half of the Evil Corpse's seal, its power had grown extremely fast, and although Han Li had suppressed it multiple times, the effects were not ideal.

Generally speaking, after an Evil Corpse had formed, it had to be eliminated as soon as possible. Han Li's approach, however, was to keep it within his body, which was a major taboo.

Now, not only was the Evil Corpse growing at an alarming rate, but its invasion of Han Li's spiritual sea was also extremely severe, almost to the point of rivaling Han Li's own strength.

If he delayed any further, he feared that the Evil Corpse would break free from the seal's restraint and come to trouble him.

Han Li's divine sense strode forward in his spiritual sea, with waves crashing behind him, dark clouds swirling above, and a powerful aura charging towards the blood-red half of the sea.

The Evil Corpse, still bound by the seal, stood with its hands hanging down, but suddenly looked up at Han Li with a strange expression, grinning and saying:

"Hehe, you've finally come... I've been waiting for so long."

"Is that so? You seem to have been waiting for me all along," Han Li replied with a smile.

"You know that you can't keep me trapped forever, so it's just a matter of time before you release me," the Evil Corpse said, its voice laced with a hint of mockery.

"Not bad, you're right. Since you've already separated from me, even if I keep you trapped, I won't be able to stop you from growing stronger and counterattacking me. So, I've come to eliminate you today," Han Li declared.

"We'll see about that," the Evil Corpse retorted, its expression unyielding. "As it stands, you're not guaranteed to win."

"Indeed, you now have the capital to contend with me, but in the end, this body will be riddled with wounds, and neither of us will benefit," Han Li said, nodding.

"I was originally just a thread of your evil thoughts, but even if I seize this damaged body, it's still a gain for me. As for you, you're already at a disadvantage, so it's better for you to worry about this," the Evil Corpse said, its voice devoid of concern.

"You're quite perceptive, but what if I fail? I'll destroy this body, even if it means annihilating my own soul," Han Li countered.

The Evil Corpse's expression finally froze, but it soon laughed and said:

"I don't believe you'll go that far. You created me, and I'm a part of you. Even if you're controlled by me, it's still better than you being destroyed. Besides, you're not ruthless enough, and I'll do better than you!"

"You're wrong about me, despite being born from my evil thoughts. If you don't believe me, we can try it out," Han Li said, his hand behind his back, the other hand extended in a gesture of invitation.

The Evil Corpse fell silent, its expression revealing a glimmer of fear.

Although it had spoken boldly, it knew that Han Li was capable of doing something as drastic as destroying his own body.

"Since you've realized your mistake, why don't we discuss a way to benefit both of us?" Han Li suggested, taking a step forward, a smile on his face.
"What method?" the Corpse asked.

"I have already prepared a body with a high rank of transformation for you. As long as you are willing to enter it calmly, after refining it, you can regain a new life," Han Li said, walking around the Corpse.

"Haha... such deceitful words, even a three-year-old child wouldn't believe them. My Dao is in conflict with yours, how can you give me freedom? Wouldn't that be a poison that would harm countless generations?" The Corpse laughed loudly.

"For now, I only want to cut you down. As for the future, we'll talk about it later. I've already said the method, whether you believe it or not is up to you." Han Li walked back to his original position and stopped, speaking.

"You really didn't deceive me?" The Corpse asked, hesitating.

"Deceived you or not, you'll know for yourself." Han Li smiled and said.

After speaking, he released some of the restrictions, allowing the Corpse to sense the presence of the Earth Immortal's body.

"The aura is actually compatible with mine, it seems you really did prepare it. Since that's the case, I can trust you this time." The Corpse examined it and unexpectedly agreed.

"Good." Han Li laughed loudly, and his mind moved.

"Qinglanglang..."

 Accompanied by the sound of chains shaking, the remaining Isolation Restriction Chains that were inserted into the Corpse's body suddenly flashed with a dark light, and then retreated, transforming into a black mist that dispersed.

The Corpse slowly stood up, stretching its muscles, and its entire body was like a burst of beans, constantly making strange noises.

"Hehe, your good intentions have really moved me, but unfortunately, even a good body is not as good as my original flesh and blood. Since we have to part ways, why don't you leave instead?" The Corpse tilted its head, looking at Han Li with a slanted gaze, laughing sinisterly.

"Alas, good intentions are met with ingratitude. I already knew you would be like this. Since we can't come to an agreement, we'll have to use force." Han Li sighed and said.

After speaking, he twisted his wrist, and his palm suddenly flashed with golden lightning, directly condensing a sword that looked exactly like the Qingtian Bee Cloud Sword.

"As long as you can defeat me, I'll willingly let you cut me down. What's the harm in that?" The Corpse smiled.

As it spoke, a sword appeared in its palm, also looking exactly like the Qingtian Bee Cloud Sword, but with dark red blood-colored lightning wrapped around it.

Han Li's pupils constricted, and he took the initiative to charge forward, his sword sweeping towards the Corpse.

The Corpse didn't fall behind, its sword flashing upwards, not blocking Han Li's attack, but instead stabbing directly towards him.

"Boom"

Accompanied by a loud thunderclap, the Corpse's sword flashed with blood light, and a thick, blood-colored lightning bolt suddenly shot out, extending hundreds of times its original length, like a blood spear stabbing towards Han Li.

Han Li was in mid-air, his previous sword strike having been a feint, and he used the momentum to leap over the Corpse's head.

He saw the Corpse's sword stir, and its blade suddenly shot out golden lightning, like a lightning vortex that surrounded the Corpse.

The Corpse saw the situation was unfavorable and wanted to move, but its feet were suddenly surrounded by symbol lights, and lightning chains extended from the symbol sea, combining with the lightning above to form a golden cage that trapped the Corpse.

Han Li leaped down to the side, his face full of mockery as he looked at the Corpse.

"When did you set up this lightning array?" The Corpse asked, its face dark and suppressed.

"Naturally, it was while we were talking. Otherwise, do you think I would waste so many words on you?" Han Li retorted.

The Corpse remained silent for a long time, then suddenly laughed loudly: "This is the real you, this is the real me, hahaha..."

Han Li saw the Corpse's crazed expression and furrowed his brow, feeling a sense of unease.

At that moment, as the Corpse's laughter spread, the entire symbol sea space began to shake violently, and the half-bloody space seemed to be boiling.

The symbol sea's water churned violently, and large blood-colored bubbles emerged from the surface, with misty vapor rising into the air, merging with the blood clouds.

The Corpse's feet were surrounded by a blood-colored wave that rose up, engulfing it and the entire lightning cage, and when the wave subsided, the Corpse had already escaped.

Han Li saw this and his eyes narrowed, his hands immediately forming a seal.

"Boom"

Accompanied by a thunderous roar, the symbol sea space behind Han Li was filled with golden lightning, weaving together to form a dense net that pierced down from the sky, and the sea's surface was whipped up by strong winds and massive waves.
