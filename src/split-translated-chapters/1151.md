Han Li's eyes lit up as he disregarded the intricate cultivation methods and focused on the time law divine abilities.

"This 'True Word Great Hand Seal' is a demonic subjugation divine ability of the True Word Sect, cultivated with the power of time laws to create a great hand seal that contains nine layers of light circles. It can store different types of time law powers within the light circles, and the more it stores, the greater its power. When used against an enemy, the True Word Great Hand Seal can unleash nine strands of time law power simultaneously, leaving no defense unbroken."

"This 'Extinction Time Divine Light' is also an attacking divine ability that condenses time law power into a demonic subjugation divine light, with enough power to pierce through the void."

"This 'Heavenly Lock Earth' is a restrictive divine ability that can imprison all things in the world when cultivated to the extreme."

The inscriptions on the stone tablets next to the formations only had the names of these divine abilities, without any detailed explanations. Miro Old Ancestor then explained the effects of these divine abilities to Han Li.

The more Han Li listened, the more he became excited and shocked. The time divine abilities here were extremely profound, containing various secrets of the heavens and the earth, exceeding his imagination.

Moreover, there were countless time law divine abilities here, with over a hundred varieties.

Han Li even saw the "Reversal True Wheel" and "True Word Heaven and Earth" divine abilities he had cultivated before.

"I see that young friend Han has already learned the 'Reversal True Wheel' and 'True Word Heaven and Earth' divine abilities, but only reached the initial or middle stages, and didn't cultivate them deeply. What a pity. These two divine abilities have great potential, and you didn't manage to tap into them." Miro Old Ancestor looked Han Li up and down, suddenly saying.

"Oh, please, Miro Old Ancestor, point out my mistakes." Han Li asked hastily.

"The 'Reversal True Wheel' divine ability has a single effect, and its cultivation depends on how much one can accelerate themselves. You, young friend Han, probably accelerated yourself by ten or twenty times, right? If one cultivates the 'Reversal True Wheel' to a high level, they can accelerate themselves by hundreds or even thousands of times." Miro Old Ancestor smiled faintly.

"Hundreds of times! Thousands of times!" Han Li gasped.

"The 'Reversal True Wheel' divine ability has a single effect, but its power is immense, and it's considered the strongest auxiliary divine ability of the True Word Sect. However, this technique puts a great burden on the physical body, and one must strengthen their physical body to cultivate it. I see that your physical body is already extremely strong, but the 'Reversal True Wheel' is only cultivated to such a shallow level, what a pity." Miro Old Ancestor looked at Han Li with a puzzled expression.

Han Li's heart pounded with excitement and self-reproach.

He had cultivated the "Reversal True Wheel" to accelerate himself by ten or twenty times, thinking it was enough, and didn't research it further. After obtaining the "Great Five Elements Fantastical World Secret" cultivation method, he focused on cultivating it, and didn't think about other time divine abilities, let alone the "Reversal True Wheel".

"As for the 'True Word Heaven and Earth' divine ability, it's a divine ability that manipulates the heavens and the earth, and its power is immense. I used it earlier to demonstrate its power. This divine ability requires a strong divine sense, and the stronger the divine sense, the greater its power. Your divine sense is extremely strong, surpassing others of the same level, and comparable to a Mahayana existence. With such a strong foundation, your 'True Word Heaven and Earth' divine ability is still in the realm of illusions, what a waste." Miro Old Ancestor shook his head.

"If it can be cultivated to a high level, it's still quite useful, right?" Han Li had spent a lot of effort on the "True Word Heaven and Earth" divine ability, and felt a bit displeased.

"The 'True Word Heaven and Earth' divine ability is not an illusion divine ability, and it can only deceive ordinary people. If it encounters someone who has studied illusion laws, it's useless, and can be broken with a single move. Don't continue to waste your efforts in the wrong direction." Miro Old Ancestor said, with a hint of reprimand.

Han Li didn't get angry, as Miro Old Ancestor was genuinely pointing out his mistakes. He nodded in response and continued to walk forward, observing other time divine abilities.

He now understood the potential and power of the "Reversal True Wheel" and "True Word Heaven and Earth" divine abilities, and they were both suitable for him.

However, he hadn't cultivated these divine abilities deeply, and his enthusiasm had cooled down significantly.

Han Li suddenly stopped in his tracks, looking at a divine ability - the "Immortal Golden Cloud" he had recently obtained.

"This divine ability is the first defensive divine ability of the True Word Sect, and once cultivated, it can repel all evil. However, the cultivation conditions for this divine ability are extremely harsh, and you shouldn't try to cultivate it lightly, even though you have obtained the cultivation method." Miro Old Ancestor spoke up.

"You knew all along..." Han Li was shocked.

"Of course, as soon as you entered the True Word Sect, I knew. If I didn't have this ability, how could I control the True Word Sect?" Miro Old Ancestor said calmly.

Han Li's face turned red, realizing that he had been under Miro Old Ancestor's observation all along, and he had thought he wouldn't be discovered. He was indeed arrogant.

He thought back to his previous actions, and realized that he had been too reckless and arrogant. He had planned to go to the Ninth Heaven Observing Platform alone, without considering that he was being hunted by the Heavenly Court and the Ninth Heaven Observing Platform. If not for the Bottle Spirit's timely intervention, he would have fallen into their hands and met a terrible end.

His cultivation progress had been rapid, and his time law abilities had improved greatly, but his mental state had not kept up. He had made such an unwise decision, and it was fortunate that he had been saved.
Han Li let out a gentle sigh, as if expelling all his pride and arrogance, and his heart felt like it had been splashed with cold water, restoring its calmness.

He continued walking forward, examining the various divine abilities, and soon arrived at the deepest part of the hall.

The last grid, however, was empty, but the inscription on the plaque beside it read "Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique". There was no scripture for the Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique.

Not only that, but the "True Word Transformation Wheel Scripture", "Cutting Time Flowing Fire Collection", and other five branch cultivation methods were also nowhere to be seen.

"The Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique is the True Word Sect's treasure, passed down through oral tradition, not written down." said Miro Old Ancestor.

"Ah, I see." Han Li responded with a raised eyebrow, nodding his head.

But he was puzzled, because in the later generations, the "True Word Transformation Wheel Scripture", "Fantasy Chen Treasure Classic", and "Water Deployment Four Seasons Technique" were all written down as scriptures, and were widely circulated.

However, after the True Word Sect was destroyed by the Heavenly Court, it was possible that the sect's scriptures were scattered, leading to this.

"We've finished looking at the cultivation methods and divine abilities, Han young friend, let's go to the treasure hall and take a look." said Miro Old Ancestor with a smile.

"I'm willing to follow your lead." Han Li replied, nodding his head.

The two of them turned around and arrived at the treasure hall beside them.

The layout of the treasure hall was similar to that of the scripture hall, with grids carved out of the walls, containing various magical artifacts. There was a set of hundreds of golden flying swords, a golden copper mirror radiating precious light, a five-colored gourd, and a white silk net as soft as clouds.

However, unlike the scripture hall, each magical artifact in the treasure hall had a nurturing formation array set up beside it.

The quality of these magical artifacts was extremely high, with the worst being a six-grade magical artifact, and the best being comparable to Han Li's white fire bead. Two of them were even time magical artifacts.

But Han Li had just experienced a moment of introspection, and his heart had become completely calm, so he was not moved by these magical artifacts. He took a rough glance and then walked out.

"Han young friend, my True Word Sect has other extraordinary places, would you like to take a look?" Miro Old Ancestor invited him again.

"No need, I've already understood the True Word Sect's strength, which is indeed extremely powerful. However, I'm used to traveling alone, and I won't be able to stay here for long, so I'll pass on the matter of becoming a disciple." Han Li shook his head, and after a moment of silence, he bowed and said.

The golden circular wheel's time pattern now only had a small half remaining, and he could only stay here for two more days. Even if he became a disciple of the True Word Sect, Miro Old Ancestor would not have much time to guide him.

Moreover, the True Word Sect and the Heavenly Court had a deep-seated grudge, which could not be resolved unless one side was completely destroyed.

Although the True Word Sect was powerful, it was still far inferior to the Heavenly Court.

If he became a disciple now, he would gain some benefits, but he would also be completely entangled in the True Word Sect and the Heavenly Court's unending feud, which would be more harm than good.

Miro Old Ancestor listened to Han Li's words with a calm expression, without showing any anger or surprise, as if he had already expected Han Li to respond in this way.

"It seems that Han young friend is indeed a very calm person, and was not dazzled by the cultivation methods, divine abilities, and magical artifacts. Very good." Miro Old Ancestor said with a smile, without showing any anger towards Han Li's refusal.

Han Li saw this and raised an eyebrow.

"Han young friend does not want to get involved in the struggle between my True Word Sect and the Heavenly Court, but you do not understand the Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique well enough. As long as you cultivate the Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique, whether or not you join the True Word Sect, you will not be able to escape the Heavenly Court's relentless pursuit. Moreover, if I'm not mistaken, you already have some grudges with the Heavenly Court, and are even being pursued by them, right?" Miro Old Ancestor said calmly.

"How did you know?" Han Li's heart skipped a beat, and he asked back.

"I can sense that you have the aura of the Refining God Technique and the Wheel of Reincarnation mask on you, and that mask is not an ordinary member, but rather a Wheel of Reincarnation son. Furthermore, you cultivate the time law, which is what the Heavenly Court fears the most. Your relationship with the Heavenly Court is already clear." Miro Old Ancestor said with a shallow smile.

"Senior's eyes are indeed piercing." Han Li was silent for a moment, then nodded his head.

"So, whether or not you join my True Word Sect, it will not affect the Heavenly Court's attitude towards you. In fact, the Heavenly Court has already determined that you are a disciple of the True Word Sect." Miro Old Ancestor said again.

Han Li did not speak, but his face sank.
