Han Li had not immediately begun his cultivation, instead, he first placed the precious materials he had obtained from the Ghost Spirit Ancestor's cave on sale in the Cycle Hall.

At this moment, he didn't have many Spirit Stones on him, so he needed to stock up on some reserves.

Fortunately, he had obtained these materials from the Ghost Spirit Ancestor's cave, so he didn't have to worry about Spirit Stone expenses for the time being.

After completing these trivial matters, Han Li closed his eyes and began to cultivate, using the "Great Five Elements Fantastical World Technique" to impact the remaining Heavenly Apertures.

Just as Han Li started to impact the Heavenly Apertures, he suddenly felt a movement in his heart and opened his eyes.

The impact on the Heavenly Apertures was unusually smooth, with no obstruction whatsoever, and the feeling was completely different from when he had previously opened the Heavenly Apertures.

At this rate, it wouldn't take him many years to open a Heavenly Aperture, and in this time-space, it was almost negligible.

"Could it be that the remaining Heavenly Apertures are already half-open, half-closed due to my activation of the Evil Corpse?" Han Li wondered, his eyes widening in surprise.

However, he quickly put aside these thoughts and focused on impacting the Heavenly Apertures.

In the blink of an eye, ten years had passed, and Han Li's shoulder suddenly flashed with golden light as a Heavenly Aperture was opened.

He felt a surge of joy, but his brow furrowed in the next instant.

As the Heavenly Aperture was opened, his strength increased, and the Evil Corpse's power within him also increased.

The isolating seal on the Evil Corpse seemed to be loosened, and the killing aura surrounding him grew stronger.

"Hehe, don't struggle anymore, the stronger you become, the stronger I'll become. One day, I'll break free from this seal, and your body will be mine!" The Evil Corpse's sinister laughter echoed in Han Li's mind.

Han Li ignored the Evil Corpse's taunts, and after a moment of contemplation, he closed his eyes again and continued to impact the Heavenly Apertures.

Time passed, and 30,000 years flew by.

Han Li's body was surrounded by golden light, with numerous golden light points densely packed, reaching a total of 839.

His aura had also increased by almost a fold, and he was no longer inferior to the likes of the Miao Fa Immortal and the Ghost Spirit Ancestor.

However, the evil aura surrounding him had also grown more intense, and his brow was enveloped in a dark, eerie aura, with a strange symbol forming.

The symbol looked like a ferocious, evil face, with black light flashing on its surface, as if it was about to burst out of Han Li's forehead.

Han Li's golden light flashed and dissipated, and he opened his eyes.

His eyes now flashed with blood-red light, occupying almost half of his pupils, and his dark red eyes seemed to radiate a hint of madness. However, his normal eyes remained calm and serene, looking extremely contradictory.

Han Li gazed at the golden light points on his body, a hint of joy flashing on his face.

This time, opening the Heavenly Apertures had been unexpectedly smooth, and in just over 30,000 years, he had opened all the remaining Heavenly Apertures, leaving only the last one untouched.

He still wasn't prepared to kill the Evil Corpse.

However, he couldn't delay any longer, as the Evil Corpse's power was growing stronger, and its maniacal laughter echoed in his mind constantly.

If not for his strong soul and unwavering determination, he would have long since been unable to endure.

The nearby Golden Boy and Wailing Spirit, who had been cultivating, stopped and looked at Han Li as he opened his eyes.

The 30,000-year-long seclusion was not long for the two of them, and they had always been concerned about Han Li's safety, so their cultivation had been somewhat divided.

"Uncle, are you okay? These years, as your Heavenly Apertures increased, it seems..." The Golden Boy looked at Han Li's half-red pupils and the intense killing aura surrounding him, his voice filled with concern.

"I can still hold on, don't worry." Han Li replied.

"Master, you've already opened the remaining Heavenly Apertures, so isn't it time to start killing the Evil Corpse?" The Wailing Spirit asked, looking at the golden light points on Han Li's body.

"It's almost time, but I still need some preparation beforehand." Han Li said, his eyes narrowing in thought.

The Wailing Spirit and the Golden Boy exchanged a glance, not daring to interrupt.

Han Li remained silent for a moment, then sealed his spiritual domain and looked at the Golden Boy and the Wailing Spirit.

"Golden Boy, Wailing Spirit, I need to start preparing for killing the Evil Corpse. You two, stay outside and guard me."

The Golden Boy and the Wailing Spirit nodded, and as they flew out, Han Li closed his eyes again, his expression serene.

After a moment, he put on the black mask from the Cycle Hall and opened the trading interface.

He pointed his finger, and a bounty task appeared, with a request for a method to kill the Evil Corpse, or any insights into the process.

This was a task he had posted during his seclusion, offering a high reward of Spirit Stones, precious materials, and various divine pills, as well as the "Five Thunder Heavenly Law True Scripture".
Han Li had promised extremely valuable rewards, but so far, no one had come forward.

Seeing this, he sighed and wasn't surprised.

Cutting off the Corpse was the key to advancing to the Mahayana Realm, and in the past, cultivators had advanced to the Golden Immortal, Taiyi, and even Mahayana Realms, all of which had precedents. As long as there were precedents, methods could be found to assist.

But Cutting off the Corpse was different, as it involved one's own obsessions, which were intangible and elusive. Furthermore, Mahayana Realm cultivators were extremely rare, making it extremely difficult to develop a method or effective experience.

However, the True Immortal Realm had existed for countless years, and the various major sects had explored and developed methods, which were known as "Corpse Cutting Techniques."

These Corpse Cutting Techniques were extremely valuable and were the true core of a sect, so it was only natural that no one would exchange them.

Han Li had posted this task, but it was just a long shot, and now it seemed that finding a method to cut off the Corpse in the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall was unrealistic.

At this point, he could only think of one method.

Han Li flipped his hand and took out the Heavenly Vessel.

He had no choice but to use the Time Law silk again, trying to shuttle back to the past and see if he could ask the Miro Old Ancestor for guidance.

Han Li activated the Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique, urged the Heavenly Vessel, and called out to the Vessel Spirit.

However, no matter how he called out, the Vessel Spirit didn't respond.

"What's going on?" Han Li's brow furrowed.

The last time at the Nine Origins Observatory, the Vessel Spirit had lost contact with him, and now, after so long, there was still no response.

He was unwilling to give up and continued to call out to the Vessel Spirit, but there was no response.

Han Li's heart sank, and without the Vessel Spirit's help, it was impossible to accurately shuttle back to the True Words Sect.

If he didn't have the Corpse Cutting Technique to assist him, he could only rely on his own strength to forcibly cut off the Corpse, which would greatly reduce the chances of success.

At this moment, a white light flew in from the entrance of the Flower Branch Space, and it was a Sound Transmission Token.

Han Li was taken aback, and with a swift motion, he grasped the token and crushed it.

The Sound Transmission Token turned into a white light sphere, and the sound of the Spirit's voice came from within: "Master, someone named Liu Le'er has come to visit, saying that she is your old acquaintance. Do you know this person?"

"Le'er... let her in." Han Li's brow moved, and he immediately shouted.

"Yes." The Spirit responded, and the white light dispersed.

Han Li stood up, calmed his thoughts, and flew out of the Flower Branch Space, arriving at the outer courtyard of the cave.

In the courtyard, apart from the Golden Boy and the Spirit, there was a blue-clad girl, Liu Le'er.

Liu Le'er's aura was surging, and her cultivation had improved significantly since their last meeting, approaching the middle stage of the Mahayana Realm.

"Le'er, you've finally come to see your brother. I'm glad to see you're safe and sound!" Liu Le'er saw Han Li's current appearance and was slightly taken aback, then flew over to him.

Han Li hadn't even opened his mouth to speak when he felt a gentle body fling itself into his arms.

The next moment, he felt two fiery gazes looking at him, and he couldn't help but touch his nose.

The Golden Boy and the Spirit exchanged a glance, then quietly left the courtyard, leaving the space to Han Li and Liu Le'er.

"Le'er, how did you come here?" Han Li gently rubbed Liu Le'er's head and asked.

"I happened to be cultivating in the Eight Wastes Mountain, and the White Marsh King told me you were here, so I came immediately." Liu Le'er smiled.

Han Li's heart warmed, and the evil thoughts in his mind seemed to dissipate.

"Brother, you've come to the Eight Wastes, so don't leave again. The resources here are abundant, and there's no one from the Heavenly Court who will harm you." Liu Le'er looked at Han Li with hope in her eyes.

"Alright, Le'er, I appreciate your kindness, but I have many things to attend to outside. This time, I won't be staying long in the Eight Wastes and will leave soon." Han Li said.

"Okay... I know you're a great person, Brother, and I won't keep you. But you must come back to the Eight Wastes often." Liu Le'er's expression turned melancholic, but she quickly recovered and smiled.

"Alright, if I have the chance, I'll come to the Eight Wastes often." Han Li said.

He was happy to see Liu Le'er, and after asking about her recent situation, he learned that she and other elites from the Eight Wastes had gathered at the Eight Wastes Mountain, cultivating in a mysterious space set up by the White Marsh King and the Yue Mian.

"Brother, what's wrong with your eyes? And why is there such a strong evil aura around you?" Liu Le'er looked at Han Li with concern.

"I'm currently trying to cut off the Corpse, attempting to advance to the Mahayana Realm's middle stage, but I've encountered some problems and been affected by some evil thoughts. Don't worry, once I've thoroughly cut off the Corpse, I'll be fine." Han Li downplayed the situation, not wanting Liu Le'er to worry about him.

"Cutting off the Corpse? Your cultivation has improved rapidly, but I heard the White Marsh King say that rapid cultivation progress can lead to insufficient understanding of each realm's cultivation, which can be detrimental to future cultivation. Especially after advancing to the Mahayana Realm, one must carefully comprehend each realm's cultivation to smoothly cut off the Corpse and advance." Liu Le'er said.

"That's true." Han Li nodded in agreement.

"I remember that you've always cultivated alone, without a sect's transmission. Do you have a suitable 'Corpse Cutting Technique' to assist you in cutting off the Corpse?" Liu Le'er asked hesitantly.
