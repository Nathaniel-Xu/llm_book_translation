Inside the Azure Mountain sect's cave, Han Li was still in seclusion, attempting to break through to the Grand Luo Realm.

Time passed like a whirlwind, and three years had gone by in the blink of an eye.

The golden light within Han Li's secret chamber grew stronger, and despite the restrictions, it began to seep out.

Powerful time law fluctuations rippled through the cave, causing the various restrictions to hum and vibrate.

Lan Yan, who had been affected by the time law fluctuations, had long since stopped her cultivation and was quietly waiting for Han Li to emerge.

As for Han Li's goal in seclusion, she had also vaguely guessed at some of it, and her heart was filled with complex emotions.

If Han Li succeeded in breaking through to the Grand Luo Realm, his power would increase greatly, although she didn't know what he was planning, it would certainly be unfavorable to the Nine Yuan Sect.

However, if he succeeded, his personal safety would increase greatly, and Lan Yan would also be relatively safe.

Moreover, if Han Li broke through to the Grand Luo Realm, her own usefulness to him would decrease, and with Han Li's personality, he might quickly release her.

If Han Li failed to break through to the Grand Luo Realm, she would have to continue living in danger, and her own time with Han Li would be greatly prolonged, and she wouldn't know when she would be free.

Lan Yan's emotions were complicated, and she couldn't say whether she hoped Han Li would succeed or fail.

Just as she was entangled in her thoughts, a loud explosion came from Han Li's secret chamber.

A massive time law fluctuation erupted, sweeping through the entire cave like a raging tide, causing the various restrictions to vibrate and shatter, with almost half of them destroyed.

Lan Yan was also affected by the time law fluctuation, and she was knocked back, only stopping when she collided with the cave wall.

She looked towards Han Li's secret chamber, where the golden light had disappeared, and she knew that Han Li's attempt to break through to the Grand Luo Realm had failed. She let out a sigh, seemingly feeling a little regretful.

"It seems I still hope he succeeds..." Lan Yan raised an eyebrow and murmured to herself.

Inside the secret chamber, Han Li's brow was furrowed, and his face was solemn.

Just as Lan Yan had guessed, his attempt to break through to the Grand Luo Realm had ended in failure.

The failure itself wasn't a problem, as his cultivation hadn't been damaged, but he couldn't find the reason for his failure.

Han Li's body currently had over 200 time law crystals, which was the same number that ordinary Grand Luo Realm cultivators could comprehend and condense. The time law power should be sufficient, and his Heavenly Eye had already opened 359 apertures, his physical body was extremely strong, and his divine soul was much stronger than that of an ordinary Taiyi Realm cultivator due to his cultivation of the Refine Soul Technique. The fire of the "Great Five Elements Fantasy Realm Technique" was also sufficient.

He should have met all the conditions, and there was no reason for him to fail.

Han Li sank into thought, carefully recalling his attempt to break through to the Grand Luo Realm, and gradually became certain that the problem lay with the time law crystals.

Just as he was about to break through to the Grand Luo Realm, everything was going smoothly, but the over 200 time law crystals suddenly became disordered, causing his body's spiritual energy to become chaotic, and everything fell apart.

"Could it be that the time law crystals are still too few?" Han Li wondered.

If the problem lay with the time law crystals, he couldn't think of any other reason.

This problem wasn't unsolvable, and he could find some treasures that contained time law power and use the "Great Five Elements Fantasy Realm Technique" to refine them.

However, treasures that contained time law power were rare, and it wouldn't be easy to find them.

Moreover, he currently had over 200 time law crystals, but it still wasn't enough. He didn't know how many more he needed to break through to the Grand Luo Realm, and he would need a lot of time law power.

"Ah, I forgot about the Years God Lamp, which contains a great amount of time law power. If I can extract a small portion of it, it should be enough." Han Li suddenly slapped his forehead and took out the Years God Lamp he had obtained not long ago.

The lamp's flame was still extinguished.

Along the way, Han Li had tried several times to re-ignite the flame, but he had been unsuccessful.

Although the Years God Lamp hadn't been lit, it still emitted a strong time law fluctuation.

Han Li immediately activated the "Great Five Elements Fantasy Realm Technique", and the True Word Wheel and other objects reappeared.

He rapidly formed a hand seal, and five time law powers entwined and compressed, forming a large golden light circle.

Han Li narrowed his eyes, and with a virtual press of his hands, the golden light circle shrunk again, transforming into a golden ring that rotated rapidly, emitting a powerful devouring power.

Han Li's face showed a hint of joy, but it quickly disappeared, and he pointed with his finger.

The golden ring shot out, enveloping the Years God Lamp, and rapidly rotated.

A powerful devouring power enveloped the Years God Lamp, attempting to extract the time law power within.

However, the "Great Five Elements Fantasy Realm Technique", which had never failed before, failed this time. No matter how the golden ring rotated and devoured, the time law power within the Years God Lamp remained unmoving.
"Could it be that the grade of the Years God Lamp is too high?"

Han Li thought for a moment, then once again activated the golden ring for a moment, but it was still futile, and he stopped. He made a guess in his heart, but he wasn't too surprised.

Because this situation had happened before, that was when he obtained the golden disk from the True Words Sect ruins.

Han Li had also tried to use the "Great Five Elements Fantasy Realm Technique" to extract the time law power from the golden disk, but it ended in failure.

Now the Years God Lamp had also failed, it seemed that this lamp was similar to the golden disk, a treasure of a similar grade.

The golden disk might be even higher, because Han Li could barely control the Years God Lamp, but the golden disk, he couldn't even budge.

Han Li played with the Years God Lamp, secretly smiled bitterly, and put it away.

He immediately fell silent for a moment, then took out the Wheel of Reincarnation mask and posted a high-priced collection task for treasures containing time law power.

Han Li had been killing people and stealing treasures for years, and he had a large number of immortal yuan stones, so he didn't need to worry about immortal yuan stones.

Now, apart from the Wheel of Reincarnation, he couldn't think of any other way to collect treasures containing time law power, so he could only wait slowly.

After doing all this, Han Li closed his eyes and sat still for a moment, then once again activated the "Great Five Elements Fantasy Realm Technique", trying to find other problems. A dazzling golden light enveloped his body.

Time passed bit by bit, and in the blink of an eye, half a year had passed.

In the secret room, Han Li was sitting cross-legged, surrounded by a layer of golden light, and the five time law embodiment objects were floating around him, surrounding him, and the entire secret room was filled with a layer of time law fluctuations.

Just then, Han Li suddenly opened his eyes, and his eyebrows furrowed.

He stood up, and the five time law embodiment objects flashed with light, entering his body, and his figure disappeared in an instant.

The next moment, Han Li had already arrived outside the secret room, standing behind Lan Yan.

Lan Yan was shocked, and Han Li grasped her neck, a golden rune like a snake climbed up, wrapping around her body, making her stiffen and unable to move.

"Sorry, Lan fellow cultivator..."

Han Li's voice had just fallen, and a loud rumbling sound came from all around.

The mountain peak where his cave was located was directly blown open by a massive force, and half of the mountain peak was overturned, revealing the entire cave to the bright sunlight.

Han Li still held Lan Yan's neck, and looked up at the sky.

A huge crystal throne was floating in the air, shaped like a lotus flower, crystal clear, and on it sat a woman in a green dress, with skin as white as jade, and a slender figure, naturally, it was Miao Fa Xian Zun.

Her hand was propping up her left cheek, and her eyebrows were slightly furrowed as she looked at Han Li, with a hint of disgust in her eyes.

Han Li felt a wave of aura fluctuations from her, and his pupils slightly contracted, this person seemed lazy and high-sitting, but the pressure she gave him was even more terrifying than Qi Mozi.

Behind her, two twin maids in blue silk dresses were standing, both around 18 years old, with delicate features, one holding a treasure canopy umbrella, and the other holding a peacock feather fan, their auras were not weak, comparable to Tai Yi early-stage cultivators.

"Hehe, I thought that someone who could make Xie Yan stumble would be an amazing character, but it turns out that you're just a despicable person who uses weak women as a shield? It's really disappointing..." Miao Fa Xian Zun sneered.

"Senior, you're speaking unfairly. This Lan fellow cultivator isn't a weak woman, she didn't yield to me no matter how I pressured her, and she even tried to kill herself several times. I was forced to use a restriction. As for using her as a shield, isn't that also because of senior's overwhelming power, and I had no choice?" Han Li said with a pretentious tone.

Lan Yan heard Han Li's words, and she understood that he was trying to clear her name, and she felt a bit guilty.

"A prisoner of war, what's the point of not dying?" Miao Fa Xian Zun sat up slightly, her expressionless face scanning Lan Yan.

The next moment, a layer of white frost appeared on Lan Yan's pale cheeks, and she was covered in a layer of pale blue ice crystals, unable to move.

Han Li's fingers flashed with silver light, and a wave of silver flames surged out, barely resisting the frosty aura spreading from Lan Yan's body, and he retreated.

However, his figure had just retreated a hundred feet when he felt the sky above him darken, and the treasure canopy umbrella flew in, covering him.

Han Li's toes tapped the air, and his figure flashed to avoid it.

The maid holding the umbrella stood on the umbrella's surface, her figure swaying and dancing, like a whirling dervish, and the umbrella followed her movements, always covering Han Li's head.

The other maid holding the fan flashed to Lan Yan's side, raised her hand, and the layer of ice crystals covering Lan Yan was dissolved, and she was pulled up, and thrown back to Miao Fa Xian Zun's side.

"Disciple greets Miao Fa Xian Zun." Lan Yan's figure stabilized, and she bowed down, saying.

"Is Lan Yuanzi dead or alive?" Miao Fa Xian Zun asked, without looking at her.

"Brother..." Lan Yan's nose twitched as she mentioned Lan Yuanzi.
