"We cultivators are not all the same, are we?" Zi Ling frowned and said.

"So, it's not just because cultivation is difficult, but also because we can't cut out the good corpses that we can't advance to the late stage of the Great Luo," Han Li said with a shrug.

"What can we do?" Zi Ling also realized the seriousness of the problem and her face turned solemn.

"I've reached the peak of the Great Luo middle stage in both my cultivation and law comprehension, and continuing to close up has no meaning. It's better to go out and take a look around, maybe I can make a breakthrough." Han Li thought for a moment and said.

"I once heard that high-level immortal cultivators often have bottlenecks not in their cultivation or laws, but in their state of mind, their understanding of the world's most fundamental truth... Speaking of which, I've never been to the True Immortal Realm, and even in the Demon Realm, I've been busy with various things... Brother Han, can you take me to take a good look around here?" Zi Ling's eyes sparkled with excitement, and she smiled.

"The True Immortal Realm is vast and far surpasses the Demon Realm, with many strange and wonderful places. It's definitely not going to disappoint you. As for me, I've been focusing on cultivation for years and haven't had a chance to explore the True Immortal Realm. Let's take a look around together." Han Li was influenced by Zi Ling's emotions, and his heart felt a little better.

He waved his hand and pulled Zi Ling, flying out of the flower petal space.

...

The Northern Dawn Immortal Realm was a small immortal realm on the outskirts of the True Immortal Realm, with a relatively thin atmosphere, but it was famous for its breathtaking aurora displays.

Of course, this reputation only applied to immortal cultivators above the Tai Yi realm, while those below the Golden Immortal realm might not even leave their birth realm in their lifetime. Those with even lower cultivation might not even leave their continent, let alone travel freely between immortal realms.

In fact, most high-level cultivators, except for a few exceptions, rarely abandoned their closed-door cultivation to travel, as even high-level immortal cultivators would not give up any opportunity to improve their cultivation.

In the northernmost part of the Northern Dawn Immortal Realm, there was a mountain range called the Heaven's Waterfall, with peaks covered in snow and ice, towering into the clouds.

When the snow melted, the water formed a waterfall, and the entire mountain range, due to its unique terrain, formed thousands of large and small waterfalls, creating a breathtaking sight.

Every time the aurora appeared, the waterfalls reflected the colors of the aurora, and the entire mountain range was shrouded in a dreamlike beauty, making people feel intoxicated.

At this moment, on the peak of the mountain, a man and a woman stood side by side, admiring the breathtaking scenery around them. They were Han Li and Zi Ling, who had changed their appearance.

...

The Tianhu Immortal Realm's Heaven's Nest Lake was famous for producing high-quality spirit jade, and the lake was always shrouded in mist, which changed with the seasons, sometimes white, sometimes purple, and sometimes pink.

This changing mist, combined with the high-quality spirit jade, made the Heaven's Nest Lake famous throughout the immortal realms.

A small boat glided across the lake, and Han Li and Zi Ling sat on the boat, their faces serene, playing a game of Go.

...

The Tianhuo Immortal Realm's Fire Bird Mountain Range was named for its peaks resembling flying birds.

The underground magma in this area was turbulent, and flames often erupted from the peaks, creating a spectacle of giant birds spewing fire.

On a dead volcano, Han Li and Zi Ling stood shoulder to shoulder, admiring the breathtaking scenery.

...

The Liulang Immortal Realm's mysterious green mud swamp, the Canghai Immortal Realm's red ocean, the Xuanfeng Immortal Realm's stormy mountain range...

Han Li and Zi Ling visited all these strange and wonderful places in the True Immortal Realm.

With Han Li's current cultivation, his speed was extremely fast, and he could cross an entire immortal realm in a short time.

In just over two hundred years, the two of them had visited 20-30 immortal realms, seeing countless strange and beautiful sights, and experiencing the unique cultures of each realm.

However, the True Immortal Realm was too vast, and the places they visited were still just a small part of the entire realm.

Because they feared the power of the Heavenly Court and the Wheel of Rebirth, they only visited small and medium-sized immortal realms, constantly changing their appearance, and their journey was very smooth, without being recognized by anyone.

In the western part of the Feiying Immortal Realm, there was a mountain range with a continuous range of mountains, covered in a type of blood-red bamboo. From high above, the scenery was breathtaking.

Every time the wind blew, the bamboo forest rustled, creating a sound like waves crashing, and the mountain range was nicknamed the "Bamboo Sea", famous for its beauty.

Near the Blood Bamboo Mountain Range, there was a small city called Yushan City, and in the city, there was a three-story wine shop. Han Li and Zi Ling sat by the window on the top floor.

They were drinking a type of bright red wine, emitting a unique aroma of bamboo leaves, made from the roots of the blood bamboo.

"The Blood Bamboo Sea is indeed famous, and this blood bamboo wine, although it's a mortal wine, tastes very good, it's worth the trip." Zi Ling took a sip of the wine, her face slightly intoxicated.

Han Li drained his cup, nodding slightly.

He was a connoisseur of fine wines, and this blood bamboo wine, although it was a mortal wine, had a unique flavor that was hard to find.

Han Li put down his cup and looked out the window.

The city was bustling with people, and the streets were crowded.

Han Li gazed out at the scene, his eyes calm and serene.
In the Flower Branch Space, twenty thousand years passed in the blink of an eye. During this time, he gained insight into the Good Corpse while also making rapid progress in the final two layers of the Cultivation of the Spirit.

Now, he had already mastered the sixth layer of the Cultivation of the Spirit, and his spiritual awareness had made another great leap forward.

At this moment, Han Li did not need to extend his spiritual sense to investigate, as everything in the entire Jade Mountain City was already within his sight.

Jade Mountain City was a mundane city, filled with all sorts of people from the three teachings and nine streams. There were officials, scholars, merchants, warriors, farmers, and many beggars.

All sorts of sounds filled the air, accompanied by countless complex emotions: joy, anger, sorrow, and sadness, as well as obsession, greed, and hatred, all of which assailed him.

Han Li suddenly let out a soft sigh, poured a cup of wine, and drank it in one gulp.

"What's wrong?" Zi Ling asked, looking over at him.

"Nothing, I just feel a sense of melancholy about the world's complexities. Whether it's ordinary people or us cultivators, no one can escape being entangled in them," Han Li said calmly.

"We, as immortals, may have long lives and be almost invulnerable to death, but we still can't escape the entanglements of human emotions and the complexities of the world," Zi Ling said, putting down her wine cup and sighing.

Han Li looked into the distance, silent and unresponsive.

"Brother Han, have you made any progress in sensing the Good Corpse?" Zi Ling asked.

Han Li shook his head silently, a look of worry appearing on his face.

"You've accompanied me for over two hundred years, and we've traveled to many places together. I'm already content. Why don't you focus on your cultivation from tomorrow on? Perhaps, after these years of contemplation, you'll have some gains," Zi Ling said softly after a moment of silence.

"The matter of cutting down the Corpse is different from other cultivations. It's not something that can be achieved just by passing time. Otherwise, why would there be so many people in the True Immortal Realm who are stuck at this stage? I have a feeling that the key to advancing to the late stage of the Great Luo lies in this mundane world. We should continue to travel and seek out opportunities," Han Li said, shaking his head.

Zi Ling heard his words and a smile appeared on her face as she nodded.

Han Li picked up the wine jug and filled the cups of the two of them, and they drank together.

"...Then, the old immortal, Lingyun, raised a flying sword, and a white light stretched for ten thousand feet, covering the light of the sun and moon. The evil dragon was immediately frightened out of its wits and turned to flee, but it couldn't escape. The sword light flashed, and the evil dragon's front claw was severed, and fresh red blood splashed down, instantly dyeing the water red." A voice came from the wine shop, and it was an old man telling a story about a sword immortal who had rid the world of evil.

The Flying Wing Immortal Realm placed great importance on the distinction between immortals and mortals, and cultivators were strictly forbidden from appearing in the mortal world. As a result, to ordinary people, immortals were mysterious and elusive, making them the best topic of conversation.

The old man's storytelling skills were not bad, and the story was exciting. Many customers gathered around to listen.

Upon hearing this, the surrounding customers all exclaimed in unison, their eyes fixed on the old storyteller, waiting for the next part of the story.

However, the old storyteller did not immediately continue. Instead, he calmly coughed and picked up his tea cup, taking a sip.

At the same time, a fifteen- or sixteen-year-old girl in a green dress walked out from beside him, carrying a copper plate, and smiled as she bowed to the crowd.

This was a signal for the customers to give money, and the storyteller's tale was indeed good. Moreover, the girl was beautiful and charming, so many customers generously threw money onto the plate, and the storyteller smiled and bowed to the customers.

Han Li saw this scene and smiled slightly.

He had grown up in a mountain village, and he had never had the chance to hear stories like this. At most, he had only heard villagers who had traveled outside tell stories about the outside world.

At that time, he was like the customers, filled with a sense of wonder about the unknown world and the strange and fantastical things that were passed down as legends among the common people.

The girl in the green dress lowered her head to pick up the money, and her white skin was even more striking. Her slender neck was exposed, making her look even more beautiful. Several of the more unsavory customers began to laugh and make jokes, saying that the girl was beautiful and so on.

The girl's face turned bright red, but she didn't stop picking up the money. Instead, she used the copper plate to cover her face, and her coy and shy demeanor only made the unsavory customers more lustful.

The girl seemed to sense the malicious gazes of the customers and quickly picked up the money before retreating.

One of the unsavory customers, a young man dressed in luxurious clothes with a lewd expression, suddenly laughed and reached out to grab the girl's wrist as she walked by.

The girl in the green dress let out a loud cry of alarm.

The young man, who was already drunk, stretched out his hand to touch the girl's chin, saying, "Little miss, you're so beautiful. Where are you from? Don't tell stories here, brother will take you to eat good food..."

The girl's face was filled with panic, and she cried out for help.

The old storyteller rushed over to try and rescue the girl, but the young man pushed him away.

The young man seemed to have some martial arts skills, and his strength was not small. The old man's body crashed into a railing, and he spat out a mouthful of blood, collapsing to the ground.

"Grandfather!" the girl in the green dress cried out, struggling with all her might, but she couldn't break free.

The other customers in the wine shop saw the commotion and some of the more timid ones quickly got up to leave.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed slightly, and a hint of displeasure flashed in his eyes, but he still remained seated, not moving.

This kind of harassment of innocent people was common in the mortal world, and it was almost always happening. It wasn't a big deal, but the storytelling earlier had touched his heart.
