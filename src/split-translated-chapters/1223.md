As the people on the high platform were speaking, the contestants on the various platforms below had already taken their positions.

With the host elder's command, the platforms erupted in a kaleidoscope of spiritual lights and thunderous collisions.

On the platform marked "Wu", Han Li and Si Kong Jian stood facing each other, not immediately making a move.

"Chang Dao friend, it's been a long time, your cultivation has made significant progress, truly commendable. However, Chang Dao friend, in the previous two trials, you didn't reveal your true strength, did you?" Si Kong Jian's eyes flickered with a hint of a smile.

"Si Kong Sect Master is too kind, speaking of strength, you, sir, also didn't reveal your full strength in the previous two battles. Could it be that you're planning to suddenly erupt, catching Chang Mo off guard? If that's the case, you might be disappointed." Han Li replied calmly.

Si Kong Jian's eyes narrowed, a hint of abnormal energy flashing in his eyes.

"Chang Dao friend's words are not small, I wonder if his strength can match his words!" He coldly shouted, waving his sleeve.

Five or six dozen cyan lights shot out from his sleeve, each one a flying sword imbued with spiritual energy, descending upon Han Li like a storm.

Han Li's figure flickered, and the platform beneath him exploded with a loud "boom", creating a large crater. However, he had already disappeared in an instant.

Si Kong Jian's face changed upon seeing this, and he quickly took out a small, dark green clock and tossed it into the air.

The clock rotated rapidly, its surface flashing with green light, and it expanded into a massive, dark green bell that released a torrent of green light. The light coalesced into a cylindrical green light screen that enveloped Si Kong Jian's body.

As the bell rotated slowly, ancient, intricate patterns could be seen etched onto its surface, surrounded by countless tiny, green symbols that seemed to be dancing in the air. It appeared to be an extraordinary defensive treasure.

Just as the dark green bell appeared, the space behind Si Kong Jian began to distort, and a golden fist, shining with dazzling light, emerged from the void. It seemed to be made of solid gold and struck the green light screen with a slow yet forceful motion.

Behind the golden fist, Han Li's figure reappeared.

A deafening "boom" shook the air!

The green symbols on the bell's surface churned violently, and the green light screen shattered simultaneously, the bell itself disintegrating into countless fragments that exploded outward in all directions.

Si Kong Jian's figure reappeared, his face filled with shock, as he rapidly retreated.

Han Li let out a low growl, and the over 900 acupoints on his body burst forth with starlight, his other hand flashing with a golden palm that struck the air.

The space above Si Kong Jian's head shook with a loud "boom", and a massive, starlight-infused palm descended upon him.

A terrifying, colossal force emanated from the golden palm, causing the surrounding void to collapse.

A massive "crash" shook the air!

Si Kong Jian's entire body was struck, slamming into the platform like a meteorite, creating a massive crater.

Han Li's face was cold and stern, and he unleashed the full power of his acupoints, causing the starlight on his body to flash rapidly. He crossed his arms, striking the air with a swift motion.

A deafening "boom" shook the air once more, and two more starlight-infused palms emerged from the void, intersecting as they struck towards Si Kong Jian's body.

The first palm had transformed into a fist, striking Si Kong Jian's body like a shooting star.

Han Li's consecutive attacks were as swift as lightning, relentless and merciless, aiming to take advantage of Si Kong Jian's underestimation and end the battle in an instant.

Otherwise, given Si Kong Jian's cultivation at the peak of the early Da Luo Realm, if the battle were to drag on, Han Li's current strength would be limited, and he might not be able to emerge victorious, or even risk exposing himself.

A series of dramatic changes unfolded in an instant, leaving most of the onlookers stunned and unable to follow Han Li's speed.

On the high platform, Chun Jun Dao person let out a soft gasp, his face filled with surprise.

Chi Meng's eyebrows twitched as he gazed at Han Li.

The other few individuals also changed their expressions, each with different emotions.

Tian Xing Zun's face was filled with delight, but Huo Yuan's eyebrows furrowed.

In the crater on the platform, Si Kong Jian's eyes were bulging with rage, his body having been struck by the starlight-infused palm. The dark energy within the palm was still churning, and his meridians were trembling, making it impossible for him to mobilize his spiritual energy.

He gritted his teeth, letting out a low growl, and a layer of cyan symbols appeared on his skin, radiating a burst of cyan light.

The next instant, he broke free from the crater, his body transforming into a cyan light screen that blocked the incoming attacks.

The two palms and one fist struck the cyan light screen, unleashing a deafening "boom".

The cyan and golden lights clashed violently, exploding outward in all directions, releasing a massive spiritual pressure that shook the nearby light screens and caused the platform to tremble violently.

The cultivators maintaining the nearby restrictive formations changed their expressions, hastily casting spells to stabilize the formations.

The cyan light screen was deeply indented, flashing violently, yet it remained taut, blocking the attacks for a brief moment before shattering.

However, Si Kong Jian had already recovered during this brief interval, his body radiating a brilliant green light that rapidly expanded, enveloping the entire platform, and he opened his spiritual domain.

Within the spiritual domain, countless green lights flashed, and a multitude of dark green trees emerged, twisting and turning as they struck the three starlight-infused palms.
The treetop's branches floated out with an eerie green glow, emitting a unique wood element law.

A light sound echoed!

Three starlight giant palms were easily pierced by the branches, and the starlight on the palms quickly dimmed, as if the energy within was being swallowed. In an instant, they vanished.

Han Li's expression turned solemn as he witnessed this scene. He was about to charge forward but stopped himself.

The wood element domain in front of him was quite peculiar, and he couldn't act rashly.

"Ah, this wood element law is quite unique," said Chun Jun Daoist from the high platform, nodding his head.

"Although Chang Qi's methods are quite ruthless and clever, he's only a minor cultivator. He may have caught Si Kong Jian off guard, but once Si Kong Jian recovers, he won't be a match for him," said Huo Yang with a hint of smugness.

"The battle is far from over, and the outcome is still uncertain," said Tian Xing Zun with a light snort.

"Then let's wait and see," Huo Yang chuckled.

On the other side of the stone platform, Zhou Xian Yang's hands were clenched into fists, his face tense with anxiety.

"Chang Daoist just gave me a good beating, now it's my turn," Si Kong Jian said, flying out of the large pit with a cold expression. He waved his hand, and the seal on his hand changed.

The heavenly energy around the platform began to fluctuate wildly, surging towards the green spirit domain. The large tree within the domain began to twist and contort, as if numerous green giant pythons were charging towards Han Li from all directions.

Han Li was currently examining the properties of the wood element law in the surrounding domain, searching for a way to break it. Witnessing this scene, his expression turned solemn.

He swiftly rotated his body, and his two arms became blurry as they transformed into countless illusory shadows that charged towards the green giant trees from all directions.

In an instant, a loud whistling sound erupted!

Numerous golden fist shadows appeared, wildly charging towards the surrounding green giant trees.

The golden and green lights clashed violently, and although the giant trees could absorb spiritual energy, they weren't particularly sturdy. The fist shadows, infused with immense power, easily shattered them.

Moreover, Han Li had realized that the green trees couldn't absorb the starlight energy within his fist shadows, making them even more susceptible to being shattered.

Si Kong Jian watched this scene unfold, his expression unchanging. Instead, he coldly laughed and continued to stimulate the growth of the green trees within the domain, sending them charging towards Han Li.

At the same time, he pinched his fingers together and waved his hand.

Dozens of blue flying swords shot out, swirling above his head. The swords flashed with blue light, transforming into blue silk threads.

The silk threads trembled, and then transformed into numerous blue lights that burst forth.

The blue lights were incredibly sharp, and Han Li's fist shadows, lacking the power of starlight, were no match for them. The blue lights pierced through the fist shadows, appearing before Han Li and descending upon him like a torrential rain.

Han Li's expression remained calm, and he took a deep breath, his stomach suddenly expanding several times in size, as if he were pregnant. The dozens of mysterious apertures in his throat burst open, emitting an unusual glow and a hissing sound.

"Roar!" he bellowed.

A wave of white sound waves erupted, condensing into countless sound knives and sound guns that shattered the surrounding void, leaving it fragmented and distorted.

The blue lights were swept away by the sound waves, shattering into pieces.

The nearby green trees within the domain were also swept away, exploding into fragments.

The restrictions around the platform began to flash wildly, weakening rapidly, and despite the efforts of the nearby cultivators to maintain them, they were ineffective. The platform itself began to crack, as if it were about to collapse.

Han Li had unleashed the "Tian Sha Zhen Yu" technique, specifically the "Tian Sha Roar" divine ability, which was far more powerful than the "Jin Gang Roar" technique used by the mountain giant ape. He had only recently mastered this technique after achieving great success in his "Tian Sha Zhen Yu" cultivation.

However, he had intentionally modified the technique to avoid revealing his identity.

On the high platform, Chun Jun Daoist witnessed this scene and calmly raised his hand.

A golden light shot out from his hand, merging with the restrictions around the platform.

The restrictions instantly turned golden, stabilizing and becoming more solid. The platform below transformed into a golden color, becoming as hard as gold, and the cracks disappeared.

On the platform, Si Kong Jian's expression changed as he witnessed Han Li's sound wave attack.

However, he quickly regained his composure, and with a slight shrug, a large amount of green mist erupted from his back, carrying a chilly glow that merged with the green trees within the domain.

The green trees instantly developed a steel-like color, their hardness increasing significantly. Han Li's fist shadows, which had previously shattered the trees with ease, now found it much more difficult to do so. Instead, the green trees, now empowered, began to wildly dance and charge towards Han Li, shattering his fist shadows and rapidly closing in on him.
