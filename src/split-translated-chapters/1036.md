Not long after, the golden light column that shot up into the sky suddenly began to flash violently, and the ancient stone gate appeared somewhat blurry under the flickering light.

Upon seeing this, the scene immediately fell silent, with everyone's eyes fixed on the golden light column.

Everyone held their breath, seemingly waiting for something.

The light column's flashing continued for only a short while, and then it suddenly brightened, becoming dazzlingly bright, but the next moment it quickly shrunk, disappearing in an instant, leaving the stone gate exposed in the air.

Almost at the same time the light column disappeared, Su Cai, Lei Yu Ce, and others immediately shot out, rushing towards the golden stone gate.

A loud, muffled sound echoed, and transparent ripples appeared on the stone gate, causing several people to be bounced back.

Jin Liu, who was the most impatient, even broke through the air, his forehead cracking open, and he couldn't help but curse loudly.

Others who were about to rush forward stopped in their tracks, seeing this scene.

It was only then that they noticed that the stone gate still had a transparent light screen, which was difficult to see if one didn't look carefully.

"It's a seal!" Su Cai and others, although not injured, frowned.

Lei Yu Ce's pupils constricted, and his left hand lifted, his five fingers swiping at the stone gate's empty space.

Five golden sword lights, each ten meters long, suddenly appeared in front of the stone gate, shining brightly like the sun, and striking the stone gate with lightning speed.

The five sword lights shattered, but the transparent light screen on the stone gate also slightly rippled, before returning to normal.

"This light screen is sturdy, but it's not unbreakable. With so many people here, as long as we work together, I believe we can break it with some effort." Lei Yu Ce withdrew his hand, saying loudly.

"What are you waiting for? Quickly break through this last seal. Qing Suo Valley, you have a Qing Suo Great Array, its power is decent, quickly deploy it. Ling Xiao Men, your Ling Xiao Lying Yang technique is also passable, quickly use it, and also Ling Yue Guan..." Jin Liu heard this, and roared at the eight sects, his tone harsh, as if he was scolding his own grandson.

The people of Qing Suo Valley and the other sects were secretly angry, but didn't say anything, as they were currently in front of the secret realm, so they each deployed their techniques, attacking the stone gate's seal.

Su Cai, Lei Yu Ce, and others also didn't idle, and they all took action.

In an instant, a multitude of divine artifacts and secret techniques' light struck the stone gate's seal, producing a dense, thunderous sound.

The stone gate's light screen flickered, appearing thin, but was actually extremely sturdy, firmly resisting the crowd's frenzied attack, without weakening in the slightest.

Everyone saw this, and their hearts were shocked.

"Don't stop, continue to attack with all your might!" Lei Yu Ce stared at the light screen, his eyes flashing, and he shouted.

Qi Mo Zi stood at the back of the crowd, not taking action, silently watching the scene before him.

He currently displayed a Golden Immortal-level aura, standing among the crowd, not drawing attention to himself, and the ones taking action were only the Tian Tian Sword Sect, Tian Shui Sect, the seven great sects, and a few other forces.

After all, the stone gate was only a small area, and with too many people, it was actually counterproductive.

"Sir, do you think they can break through the seal like this? Shouldn't you lend a hand?" Xiong Shan asked quietly.

"The method is a bit dull, but it should be fine, it's just a matter of time. Now is not the time to reveal our identity." Qi Mo Zi shook his head.

Xiong Shan nodded upon hearing this.

Time passed, and in the blink of an eye, a day and night went by.

The Tian Tian Sword Sect, Tian Shui Sect, and others took turns attacking, and the stone gate's seal withstood a day and night's attack, finally starting to weaken.

"The seal is starting to loosen, add a bit more force!" Lei Yu Ce's eyes lit up, and he shouted.

The crowd's spirits were shaken, and they once again increased their attack.

In the blink of an eye, half a day passed, and the stone gate's seal was finally broken, shattering with a loud "bang".

A large amount of golden light surged out from the stone gate, forming a golden whirlpool, with countless golden light points jumping about, resembling the starry sky's whirlpool, mysterious and unfathomable.

...

Deep within the secret realm, Han Li was breaking through a palace's seal, his face suddenly changing, and he looked towards the secret realm's entrance.

He could sense a powerful spatial fluctuation, coming from there.

"The secret realm's entrance will eventually be discovered...I wonder how many people will rush in?" He furrowed his brows, and muttered to himself, before his eyes flashed with a fierce light, and he shouted.

Han Li's body was enveloped in a golden light, and he transformed into a mountainous giant ape, punching the palace's seal.

The air directly collapsed where his fist struck, and the palace's seal violently fluctuated, before being torn apart. Not only that, but Han Li's fist's residual energy also caused some damage to the palace within the seal.
Han Li couldn't be bothered with these things, and immediately flew into the palace.

Since he knew that an outsider had entered, his time was limited.

……

In the valley of the blue silk.

"Go!"

Lei Yu Ce's face lit up with joy, and he flew into the golden whirlpool first, disappearing without a trace.

Although there were many Taiyi realm cultivators present, with over a dozen, Lei Yu Ce was undoubtedly the strongest, so no one had any objections, and they all followed him into the whirlpool.

After the people from the major sects entered, the others also entered the whirlpool one after another.

Lan Shi siblings, Qi Mozi, and others all hid among the crowd, entering the golden whirlpool and arriving at the secret realm.

Everyone appeared in the same place, which was the same valley where Han Li had entered the secret realm earlier.

Behind them, a golden whirlpool slowly rotated in mid-air, and the outside situation could be vaguely seen.

Qi Mozi's gaze swept around, and a flash of light appeared in his eyes.

"Xiong Shan, you follow these people and take advantage of the opportunities here. I'll go ahead." Qi Mozi said to Xiong Shan, and before he could respond, he disappeared without a sound.

Xiong Shan saw Qi Mozi disappear, and his face didn't show any emotion, but he was secretly happy.

After all, he could finally make his own decisions without having to ask Qi Mozi for permission. However, without Qi Mozi by his side, he was just a small Jin Xian, and he felt a bit lonely and worried.

She Qian, Lan Shi siblings, and others didn't stay long, and they quietly used their techniques to hide their bodies and head towards the depths of the valley.

In another corner of the crowd, two black-robed men and women stood.

"Lan Yuanzi and the others have gone towards the depths of the secret realm. Let's go, or we'll be left behind." The black-robed girl transmitted a message, and the black-robed youth nodded.

Then, the two of them disappeared without a trace.

Everyone's techniques were more and more ingenious, and even Lei Yu Ce didn't notice anything.

They were all marveling at the environment of the secret realm, and after a while, they finally calmed down and were about to explore the depths of the valley.

Just then, the sky of the secret realm suddenly shook violently, and the air was filled with the sound of thunder. The sky was covered with white lightning-like light, and the sound was deafening.

Everyone's faces changed, and they looked up at the sky. Lei Yu Ce and the others were no exception.

Rumble!

The entire secret realm shook like an earthquake, and then the sound of thunder echoed through the sky. The sky was filled with black cracks, and it was a shocking sight.

Next, a scene that shocked everyone appeared!

The golden whirlpool in mid-air suddenly expanded and contracted several times, and then exploded with a loud bang, disappearing without a trace.

The shaking of the ground and the trembling of the sky finally subsided.

"What's going on?" Han Li flew out of the palace, saw the strange phenomenon in the sky, and his face changed.

Behind him, the palace was in shambles, and the roof was torn off. The inside was a mess.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and he quickly looked away, continuing to fly towards the depths of the secret realm.

At the same time, Lei Yu Ce and the others were also shocked, especially since the entrance to the outside world had been closed, making many people uneasy.

"Lei Dao friend, Su Dao friend, I think you two seem to know something about this cave. Do you know what's going on?" A burly man from the Ling Xiao Sect looked at Lei Yu Ce and Su Qian, and asked.

Everyone else looked over, waiting for their response.

"Regarding this cave, I know something. A thousand years ago, there was a great expert named Tai Sui Xian Zun, who cultivated the Time Law, one of the three great supreme laws. His power was naturally not to be underestimated. However, he disappeared without a trace, and no one knows what happened to him. I only know this because I read it in our sect's ancient texts. I think this cave is probably the one he left behind." Lei Yu Ce and Su Qian exchanged a glance, and then Lei Yu Ce spoke up.

Everyone's faces lit up with joy, and their earlier unease due to the entrance disappearing was alleviated.

A great expert, a Tai Sui Xian Zun, had left behind a cave, and it was likely to contain many treasures. Moreover, if what Lei Yu Ce said was true, the cave had been hidden for a thousand years, and the age of the treasures inside was unimaginable.

Lei Yu Ce's eyes moved, and he looked at Su Qian again. He sent a message to her, and she responded with a slight nod.

"That's the situation. Do you two have any idea what's going on?" The burly man asked again.

"I only know this much, but I think the secret realm's space is collapsing. We forced our way into the entrance, and the space is starting to break down. It won't last much longer." Lei Yu Ce thought for a moment before speaking, and his words made everyone's hearts tighten.
