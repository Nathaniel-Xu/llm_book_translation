Baiyun Daozu's face instantly lost its color as he saw the sudden appearance of the two tribes of demons and monsters. He was about to rush out, but his body froze in place.

At that moment, two figures flashed into existence with a "whoosh" sound.

One of them was a middle-aged man in his 40s, dressed in white, with a head full of white hair and a few inches of white beard. He exuded an icy aura, and his expression was cold and detached, giving the impression that he was a block of ice.

The other person was a short, elderly man, less than five feet tall, with a face like cinnabar and a nose like a burning flame. He had a warm and friendly smile.

Both of them had an aura that was deep and unfathomable, and they stood shoulder to shoulder with Baiyun Daozu, blocking the way of Guo Huo and the others.

"Demons! And the True Spirit of the Barbarian Realm! How did they end up here?"

The people in the Jade Pool were shocked, and their first thought was that something was amiss. They quickly got up and gathered around Guo Huo and the others.

Cangwu True Lord waved his hand, releasing a red light that enveloped Mengpo and the others, and then flew down to stand beside the Heavenly Court's Daozus.

A green shadow flashed, and another group of people appeared beside Cangwu True Lord, led by a robust man with green hair and a green beard. His cultivation level was unfathomable, and he was also a Daozu.

"Wind Dao friend," Cangwu True Lord said, nodding at the robust man.

"Qingwu Dao friend," the robust man replied, smiling.

The situation at the Bodhi banquet had changed dramatically, and the atmosphere was tense. The two Daozus, who had not been close friends before, stood together instinctively.

Just then, a red-robed old man flew over and landed beside Cangwu True Lord and the robust man.

The old man had a bald head, a thin and dry face, and a sinister aura. His eyes were bright and sharp, like two knives, and he was also a Daozu.

"Wind Dao friend, Qingwu Dao friend, I, Zhen, have come to pay my respects. The situation is a bit chaotic, so I'll take a break here. You won't mind, will you?" the old man said with a smile.

"Ah, Zhen Dao friend, you're welcome to stay. We're glad to have you," Cangwu True Lord and the robust man said in unison, exchanging a glance.

This red-robed old man was named Zhen Shi Yin, a veteran Daozu who had been hiding in a small xian domain for a long time. He was eccentric and had not founded a sect or passed down his dao. However, his strength was formidable, and he had left behind many legends in the xian domains.

With Zhen Shi Yin joining them, their strength increased significantly, and they were more confident of getting through the current crisis.

Among the guests at the Bodhi banquet, most of the Daozus had not come in person, but had sent their junior disciples instead. The only Daozus present were Cangwu True Lord and his two companions.

Therefore, when they saw the three of them standing together, many cultivators gathered around them.

...

Han Li's mouth curled into a faint smile, and he looked completely at ease, without any sign of panic or anxiety.

This scene was observed by the four people from the Purple Bamboo Alliance, who felt a sense of unease in their hearts. They couldn't understand why they felt intimidated by someone who was not even a Daozu.

Earlier, when they were outside, they had put aside their differences and worked together to defeat their enemies. Now, they were facing Han Li, and their strategy was to surround him.

The leader, Purple Bamboo, nodded at Dong Li Hu and Zhu Yan, who immediately moved to the left and right, forming a simple encirclement around Han Li. Only Meng Yuan remained in the back, hidden behind Purple Bamboo.

Han Li's eyes flickered, and he began to think.

From the way Dong Li Hu had blocked his sword, it seemed that he was cultivating the Earth Attribute Law, specifically the Mountain Law, which emphasized strength and defense. It wouldn't be easy to defeat him in one blow.

As for Zhu Yan and the ugly old woman, they were probably cultivating the Fire Attribute Law, which emphasized powerful attacks. The person hiding behind them must be the one with the killing move.

Han Li's thoughts were interrupted by a sudden explosion of purple flames, which shot towards him like a tidal wave.

" Purple flames... Fire Attribute Law," Han Li thought, his body quickly retreating.

At the same time, a giant golden wheel appeared behind him, spinning rapidly and releasing golden light that enveloped the surrounding space.

The purple flames that were chasing him were slowed down by the golden light, and Han Li was able to shake them off.

However, the flames and the golden light clashed, producing a series of ear-piercing explosions. The golden light, which contained the power of the Time Law, was being rapidly consumed.

Just then, a figure emerged from the purple flames, wielding a purple sword and stabbing towards Han Li's heart.
Han Li had long been prepared for this, and the fist he had been holding in his waist suddenly shot out, striking the opponent's sword tip.

"Boom!"

A massive force exploded out, and countless purple flames burst forth, scattering in all directions like a peacock's plumage.

Before Han Li could retract his fist, a flash of golden light appeared above his head, and a gigantic mountain peak descended from the sky, pressing down on him.

The golden mountain peak was surrounded by a thick layer of yellow clouds, emitting a powerful earth-attribute law aura. As it fell, it seemed to compress the entire void, causing it to sink downward.

Han Li looked up and saw that the mountain peak was inscribed with four giant ancient characters: "Xiong Zhen Wu Yue".

He swiftly turned his other hand and struck out with a palm, unleashing a massive golden light that shot upwards and collided with the mountain peak.

The mountain peak's descent was momentarily halted, and the four characters "Xiong Zhen Wu Yue" suddenly sank downward, revealing a massive palm print.

However, the mountain peak merely paused for a moment before continuing its descent, crashing down on Han Li once more.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he raised a palm to resist the mountain peak's force, using his single arm to hold it back.

Just as he was stabilizing the mountain peak, a loud shout echoed from above, and a golden light descended from the sky, landing outside the mountain peak.

The golden light coalesced into the figure of Dong Li Hu, who radiated an aura of immense power, as if he were a golden-armored deity.

Dong Li Hu opened his hand, and with a few swift strokes, he drew three characters in the air: "Shou Yang Shan".

The characters seemed to be written in a flowing script, but they were actually more like talismans, each stroke connected to the next, creating a sense of dynamic movement.

As he finished writing, a miniature mountain peak appeared in his palm, alongside another tiny mountain peak.

Suddenly, a massive golden light descended from the sky, and an enormous mountain peak, twice the size of the previous one, crashed down on top of the smaller peak.

"Boom boom boom..."

A massive shockwave rippled out, creating a circle of golden light that spread in all directions.

Han Li, who was standing beneath the mountain peak, stumbled backward, his arm bending as he tried to retreat.

As he attempted to withdraw his other arm, the purple flames on the sword in his hand surged, forcing him to strike out with his fist once more.

Han Li was now facing off against two powerful Dao Ancestors, using a single fist and palm to resist their attacks.

At the same time, the highest peak in the Huang Shan continent, the "Wu Yue Feng", was experiencing a massive earthquake, causing the peak to crumble.

As the Dao Ancestor of the mountain's law, Dong Li Hu could connect with the earth's veins anywhere in the realm, moving any mountain or peak he desired.

However, within the Ten Sides Million Immortals Great Array, he was still affected by the array's power, albeit to a lesser extent than Han Li. Though he couldn't directly summon the true form of the mountain, he could still call upon its true intent, which was equally powerful.

Seeing Han Li's single arm still holding back the mountain peak, Dong Li Hu mobilized his law power once more, writing the characters "Shen Yuan Feng" in his palm.

As he finished writing, a tiny mountain peak appeared, which then grew into a massive golden peak that crashed down on the previous mountain peak.

The massive force was too great for Han Li to resist, and he was forced to use his shoulder to support the three mountain peaks.

Despite his small stature, Han Li's smile never wavered.

His head tilted slightly, and his gaze turned to the ugly old woman who had yet to make a move. She was standing in the void, her hands forming a strange seal, her body radiating a flickering light.

For some reason, Han Li felt a sense of wariness towards this person, second only to the hidden figure in the background.
