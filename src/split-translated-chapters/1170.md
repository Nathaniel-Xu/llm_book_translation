I won't tolerate you harboring hatred towards human cultivators, or looking down on Han Li. From now on, when you meet him, you must be courteous and respectful, and not have any conflicts with him. Do you understand?

Liu Qing opened his eyes quickly and spoke slowly.

"What... do you mean that Han Li is still within our tribe?" The old man in gray robes heard this and his eyebrows twitched upwards again.

"Didn't you hear my words clearly? Do I need to repeat them again?" Liu Qing's eyes narrowed, and his gaze sent a chill down the old man's spine as the air in the grand hall dropped.

"No, no need... I understand." The old man's heart skipped a beat, and he hastily agreed.

Liu Qing snorted again, and ignored the old man.

He had just agreed with Bai Ze not to mention the incident in the great hall, so he couldn't explain the reason to the old man in detail. He hoped that the old man would understand, otherwise, he would have to use force.

Liu Qing didn't stay for long, and soon stood up and walked out.

...

In the Tian Hu tribe's guest hall.

"I heard that you brought a Pi Xiu with you to the Eight Desolations Mountain. May I take a look?" Bai Ze asked Han Li as soon as Liu Qing left.

"Yes, please wait a moment." Han Li's thoughts quickly turned, and since things had come to this, he had no other choice but to agree. He nodded and waved his hand, taking out Xiao Bai from the flower branch space.

Xiao Bai was still unconscious, unmoving.

"Indeed, it's a Mo Yan Pi Xiu, and it's even his bloodline. Ah, how wonderful. It's as if the heavens have eyes." Bai Ze looked at Xiao Bai, his eyes lighting up with excitement as he muttered to himself.

"Does the senior recognize Xiao Bai? He's been unconscious, and I've tried to revive him, but unfortunately, I haven't succeeded." Han Li shook his head.

"Its name is Xiao Bai? The name is fitting, if I'm not mistaken, it's the descendant of my old friend Mo Yan Pi Xiu. Mo Yan Pi Xiu was killed by the Heavenly Court's Dao Ancestors, and I didn't think he had any descendants left in the world. Thank you, Han Li, for bringing him to the Eight Desolations Mountain. As for Xiao Bai's injuries, I fear that only I can treat him in this desolate land." Bai Ze nodded to Han Li, expressing his gratitude.

"Xiao Bai is my friend, and he's injured and unconscious. I brought him here for treatment, so it's only natural." Han Li nodded.

He didn't expect that Bai Ze and Mo Yan Pi Xiu had such a relationship, which made his own safety even more secure.

Bai Ze saw that Han Li didn't take credit for himself, and a hint of a smile appeared on his face. He then waved his hand, and a beam of white light shot out, pulling Xiao Bai to his side.

He then flipped his hand and took out a blood-red pill, which had white patterns on its surface. The patterns emitted a strange aura, similar to the Dao patterns on the Dao pills, but also different.

The white patterns depicted a white beast, which was similar to Xiao Bai's Pi Xiu form.

Han Li saw the blood-red pill, and his eyes lit up as he was about to examine it closely.

Bai Ze pointed to Xiao Bai's chin, and Xiao Bai's mouth opened. Bai Ze snapped his fingers, and the blood-red pill turned into a beam of blood light, which accurately flew into Xiao Bai's mouth.

Bai Ze then pointed to Xiao Bai's forehead, and a bright crystal light appeared on his fingertip. Countless black talismans flashed out, rolling and churning, before flowing into Xiao Bai's forehead.

Xiao Bai's motionless body suddenly trembled, and a circle of white light radiated from his body. He let out a faint cry of pain, but his eyes remained closed.

Han Li saw this scene, and his heart quickened, but he didn't interrupt.

Bai Ze's hands formed a series of hand seals, and he patted Xiao Bai's forehead with his palm. He then withdrew his hand.

Han Li's gaze flashed, and he saw a faint black mark on Xiao Bai's forehead, which looked strange.

This mark was definitely not there before, and was likely created by Bai Ze's spell.

At this moment, Xiao Bai's body trembled, and the white light around him flashed intensely before calming down. He then slowly opened his eyes.

"Xiao Bai, you're awake?" Han Li quickly walked forward.

"Master!"

Xiao Bai saw Han Li, and his face lit up with joy. He tried to stand up, but his body was still weak, and he stumbled. Luckily, Han Li caught him.

"You're injured, don't rush to move." Han Li said.

"Master, I'm glad I met you. The old master was captured by the Jiuyuan Sect, and I barely escaped. You have to rescue her... wait, where is this place?" Xiao Bai's body was still weak, but his mouth was recovering, and he started shouting.

"We're in the Desolate Realm, don't worry about the old master, I'll find a way to rescue her." Han Li's expression turned serious, and he reassured Xiao Bai, before waving his hand to send a pure spiritual energy to help Xiao Bai control his body.

Xiao Bai was assisted by Han Li, and he quickly stood up, looking at Li Qi and Bai Ze.

Bai Ze also looked at Xiao Bai, a warm smile on his face.

"You should thank Senior Bai Ze for saving you," Han Li said.

"Thank you, Senior Bai Ze, for saving me." Xiao Bai bowed to Bai Ze.

"I was friends with your father, so this is just a small matter. Do you remember your father's affairs?" Bai Ze asked.

"Father? Do I have a father?" Xiao Bai was taken aback.

"It seems your father sealed your memories, which is also good. If you remembered those things, you would likely seek revenge against the Heavenly Court, and it would be difficult for you to live peacefully until now." Bai Ze's eyes flashed, and he muttered to himself.
Xiao Bai's face changed, his eyes fixed intently on Bai Ze, and he asked urgently, "Senior, do you know my background?"

"I just said that I and your father are close friends, so I naturally know your background, but now is not the time to tell you, you will know soon," Bai Ze replied calmly.

Xiao Bai's brow furrowed, clearly dissatisfied with Bai Ze's response, and was about to ask further when he heard Han Li's voice and had to listen to Bai Ze's instructions.

"Junior Han, Xiao Bai has just woken up, but his inner energy has not recovered, let me take him back and help him adjust his body," Bai Ze said to Han Li.

"Thank you, Senior, but I have been with Xiao Bai for a long time and have some experience in helping him adjust his body, so I don't need to trouble you," Han Li hesitated for a moment before refusing.

Bai Ze gave him a feeling of being not bad, but he was still not willing to let him take Xiao Bai away.

"Alright, since that's the case, Xiao Bai will be left to you," Bai Ze smiled slightly and nodded.

"Junior Han, you will be staying at Bahuang Mountain for a while, please take care of Xiao Bai and don't let anything happen," Bai Ze said to Li Qi on the side.

"Yes, Father," Li Qi replied quickly.

Bai Ze nodded and then disappeared, his whereabouts unknown.

Seeing Bai Ze disappear, Han Li's tense heart relaxed slightly.

Xiao Bai looked at Han Li, then at Li Qi, and didn't fully understand the situation, but since there were outsiders present, he didn't ask further.

"Junior Han, it seems that Father is very fond of you, I've never seen him be so considerate of others," Li Qi said with a smile after Bai Ze left.

"Senior is being too kind, I'm a bit flustered," Han Li replied.

"Don't be flustered, Father is not like Liu Qing, he won't scheme against you, don't worry," Li Qi patted Han Li's shoulder and laughed.

"I didn't mean that," Han Li said, looking around and shaking his head.

"Never mind, Junior Han, what are your plans for now? The Blood Sacrifice Conference is still some time away, and since Xiao Bai is the descendant of the Moke Ye Pixiu, he should participate, it will be beneficial for him. And I think Father wants you to stay and participate in the conference," Li Qi said with a smile.

"Bai Ze Senior wants me to stay and participate in the Blood Sacrifice Conference?" Han Li was taken aback, recalling Bai Ze's words and expression, which indeed seemed to convey that intention.

"Although Bai Ze Senior has invited me warmly, I have some things to investigate here, I'm not sure if I can respond immediately," Han Li said after a moment of thought.

Jin Tong was currently in the hands of the Jiuyuan Observatory, and he needed to understand the situation from Xiao Bai before making a decision about whether to stay in the wilderness.

"Of course, Junior Han, will you continue to stay at the Tianhu tribe or will you come with me to find another place to stay?" Li Qi asked with a smile.

"The Tianhu tribe doesn't seem to welcome me, so please arrange a quieter place for me to stay," Han Li replied.

"No problem, I'll take care of it," Li Qi said, patting his chest.

The two of them quickly left the great hall and headed outside.

As for Xiao Bai, his identity was quite sensitive, and he was taken back to the Huazhi space by Han Li.

Just then, Liu Qing came walking towards them.

"Junior Master, Junior Han, are you leaving? Ah, has the King left already?" Liu Qing asked with a smile.

"I haven't seen Junior Han in a long time, I want to take him to my place for a few days, chat with him, will the tribe leader be uncomfortable with that?" Li Qi asked Liu Qing with a smile.

"There's no problem, Junior Han, you're welcome to come to the Tianhu tribe anytime, Liu Qing will be waiting for you," Liu Qing said with a smile.

Han Li nodded slightly to Liu Qing, and followed Li Qi out of the Tianhu tribe's residence.

Liu Qing personally escorted the two of them to the door, watching as they disappeared into the distance before sighing and turning back.

Han Li followed Li Qi to a quiet courtyard in the town of Zhuanghuang, which was far from the bustling streets, with lush green trees and a serene atmosphere.

"This is our tribe's residence, other tribes won't come to disturb us, Junior Han can rest assured, there are people arranged by me outside, if you need anything, just order them," Li Qi said.

Han Li nodded, quite satisfied with the place.

Li Qi seemed to have something on his mind and didn't stay for long, quickly bidding farewell and leaving.
