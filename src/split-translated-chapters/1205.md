"You should be proud that you can make me use the Heaven Scorched Earth Flame. Now, you can die." Chi Meng's voice was like a thunderclap.

At this moment, her eyes had transformed into two bright red orbs, as if there was a boundless sea of flames churning within them. The light was so intense that it was hard to look directly at her.

The next moment, the flames behind her erupted in a massive blaze, and countless golden petals flew towards Han Li. The flames illuminated the entire sky.

With Chi Meng as the center, the temperature within a radius of ten thousand miles skyrocketed, and the air became distorted and scorched. The ground cracked and turned red, making it feel like being in a furnace. Even breathing became difficult.

Han Li's expression remained unchanged, and his eyes only narrowed slightly. The spiritual domain that had expanded to a thousand miles suddenly contracted, only covering a radius of a few dozen meters.

He saw Han Li's hands form a seal, and the round moon above his head began to rotate, emitting countless golden rays of light. The mountains and rivers on the ground began to shift, and a storm of golden sand rose into the air.

The trees on the mountain swayed as if blown by the wind, and the sound of rustling leaves filled the air. The flow of time also began to move, and the sky was filled with a brilliant light. The atmosphere within the spiritual domain changed in an instant.

The golden petals that flew towards Han Li were incredibly fast, but when they entered his spiritual domain, they slowed down. The flames on the petals began to tremble, and the speed of the petals decreased. Thin threads of fire began to separate from the petals, disappearing into the void.

The distance of a few dozen meters was like an invisible barrier, making it difficult for the petals to cross. With each inch they moved forward, some of the flames were separated, weakening their power.

By the time the petals reached Han Li, they were only a faint, spark-like glow.

"How is this possible?" Chi Meng's mind was filled with shock.

In her opinion, it was Han Li's spiritual domain that had consumed her flames. But Han Li knew that the flames were not being consumed, but rather, they were being broken down by the power of the Five Elements Fantasy, reversing their flow of time.

This was like the first time Han Li had seen the Time-Space Crystal Wall. Any external objects that entered the Five Elements Fantasy would be repelled by the powerful time force, reversing their flow of time.

"You've lost," Han Li said with a cold smile, taking a step forward.

Chi Meng knew that the Time Law was one of the three supreme laws, and it was naturally superior to the other laws. But she had never expected such a crushing advantage, and her heart was filled with fear.

The flames on her body surged, and she attempted to flee.

"Where do you think you're going?" Han Li asked with a cold smile, expanding his spiritual domain to ten thousand miles once again.

The round moon in the sky flew down, chasing after Chi Meng. The True Word Treasure Wheel's power was even stronger when it was closer to her, and Chi Meng felt the binding force growing stronger, slowing her down.

At this moment, she could only raise her hand and point at her brow, saying, "Break."

As she spoke, the two black-robed figures who had been suppressed by Han Li's spiritual domain suddenly had a flame mark appear on their brows. A fierce flame erupted from their bodies, and they exploded into a ball of fire.

The blast wave swept out, destroying Han Li's spiritual domain and sending golden sand flying everywhere. The trees on the mountain were also destroyed, leaving behind blackened scars.

Han Li, who was connected to the spiritual domain, felt the impact and coughed up blood.

But in that brief moment, Chi Meng had already disappeared into the distance.

Meanwhile, Qu Lin had finished his battle, and the cultivator named Jian Qiu had been defeated. Qu Lin had revealed his true form and swallowed Jian Qiu whole.

The cultivator Xi Tang had also been defeated by Ti Hun, who had used his Ghost Claw to restrain him.

As it turned out, the cultivator Xi Tang was actually quite powerful, and his spiritual domain was filled with strange and exotic objects. However, he had encountered Ti Hun, who was a natural nemesis.

"Don't kill him, please don't kill him," a voice begged.

It was Lan Yan, who was pleading with Ti Hun.

Ti Hun nodded and shot a dark red beam of light from his brow, which struck Xi Tang and bound him with a secret technique.

"I'll never let you extract any information from me," Xi Tang said, his eyes flashing with determination.

But before Ti Hun could react, a dark aura erupted from Xi Tang's body, and a ghostly creature emerged from his right eye socket. The creature's mouth was open wide, and it bit down on Xi Tang's head.

Ti Hun's eyes widened in surprise, and he quickly moved to stop the creature.
Almost simultaneously, a dark glow appeared in the dantian of Xi Tang, the elder, and it seemed to be on the verge of exploding.

"Be careful..." Han Li exclaimed.

Ti Hu saw this and her eyes flashed with an eerie red light. She rapidly retreated, disappearing from view.

The next instant, a deafening crash shook the air.

A black column of light shot up, transforming into a massive black whirlwind that swept across the area.

In an instant, the winds changed and the sky grew dark. A powerful, invisible force enveloped the surrounding space, making it impossible to escape.

The explosion of Da Luo's dantian was powerful enough to stir up the heaven and earth.

In the midst of the chaos, Han Li's figure darted around the edge of the whirlwind, quickly pulling out Xiao Bai, Ti Hu, Lan Yan, and Qu Lin. Using his spiritual energy, he tied them together with a rope made of spiritual energy.

A loud rumbling sound echoed through the void, and a massive silver lightning bolt descended from the sky, forming a lightning array that surrounded them. In an instant, they vanished from their original location.

The vast expanse of the heaven and earth was left with only the violent winds and chaotic void ripples, which continued to ravage the area without end.

...

Outside the Golden City, in a mountain valley, there was an underground dark river. The space inside was quite spacious.

Han Li and the others, who had been transported away using the lightning array, appeared in the underground space of the dark river.

"Brother Han, I will never forget this favor you have done for me. If I have the chance, I will definitely repay you," Qu Lin said, bowing his fist in gratitude.

"I was just passing by and didn't expect to run into you. I don't know why those people from the Heavenly Court are chasing you. Is it because of the Time Tower incident?" Han Li asked, puzzled.

"I'm not sure either. They didn't say much when they caught up to me, and they didn't mention anything about the Time Tower. But this isn't the first time they've chased me, and it's not unusual," Qu Lin replied, thinking for a moment.

Han Li listened to this and turned his gaze to Lan Yan, who was looking a bit lost and forlorn. "Brother Lan, aren't you from the Nine Yuan Observatory? Why are you involved with those people from the Heavenly Court?" he asked.

"I... I was trying to save my brother..." Lan Yan replied, his face filled with bitterness.

"Lan Yuanzi... what's going on?" Han Li asked, his brow furrowed in concern.

"My brother is now just a strand of spirit, and I tried many methods to save him after returning to the sect, but they all failed. Then I heard that Xi Tang, the Da Luo cultivator who practices the Yin Soul Law, had a way to revive my brother. I went to find him and asked for his help. They found out that I had seen Qu Lin in the Time Tower and remembered his aura, so they used that to track him down. That's why I was with them," Lan Yan explained, sighing.

Qu Lin heard this and shot a glance at Lan Yan, his eyes flashing with a hint of killing intent.

"Do you know why the Heavenly Court people are chasing Brother Qu?" Han Li asked, his brow raised.

"They just wanted to use me, and they didn't say what their plan was," Lan Yan replied.

"Brother Han, do you remember the people from the Huai Yang sect we met in the Time Tower?" Qu Lin asked suddenly.

Han Li thought for a moment, and a strange expression flashed across his face.

"You're saying that their goal this time is the same as before, to extract the Law threads from your body?" Han Li asked.

"We'll know if we investigate," Ti Hu said, her eyes gleaming with a sly light.

"Investigate...?" The others looked at her in confusion.

Ti Hu smiled mischievously and pointed to her own brow, where a vertical eye appeared. A dark red light shot out, and a residual soul was bound by a dark red chain, struggling to break free.

Han Li looked closely and saw that the residual soul was identical to Xi Tang's face.

"How did you get this residual soul? His dantian has already exploded, and he even summoned an evil spirit to devour his own spirit. How did you manage to get this?" Qu Lin asked, surprised.

"I have my ways," Ti Hu said, looking pleased with herself.

Qu Lin saw that she didn't want to explain, so he didn't press the matter. However, his eyes still held a hint of curiosity.

"Her true form is a punishment beast, skilled in the Yin Soul Law. It's not difficult for her to do this," Han Li explained with a smile.

Lan Yan heard this and his eyes lit up, looking at Ti Hu with a mixture of curiosity and caution.

Han Li noticed the change in his expression and said, "Let's investigate and see what we can find out."

"Alright," Ti Hu said, nodding. She shot a blood-red crystal thread from her brow, which entered the residual soul of Xi Tang.

The residual soul, which had been struggling to break free, suddenly stopped moving, and the red light surrounding it disappeared.
