"You are you, I am I. I and you are alike, born in that remote mountain village in the mortal realm, and grew up watching the thatched roof of the black hut made of mud and straw. We have the same parents and siblings, the same mundane life... and in the end, we both left there, went through countless hardships, and sought out a hint of fate, finally ascending to this realm of True Immortals."

Han Li finally calmed down a bit, and a thought occurred to him. He opened his mouth to ask, "Is it possible that there are two Han Lis in this world, unless you are a product of my time-traveling?"

In Han Li's opinion, unless he were to travel back in time to the present, there would be no way for two versions of himself to exist. But why did this version of himself cultivate the Wheel of Reincarnation technique?

"No, that's not it. Even if I were to travel back in time, I wouldn't be able to stay for long. The laws of time would eventually consume the thread of time, and my physical body would return to its original timeline. You can't be me." Han Li shook his head, saying.

"Not quite, you and I are two separate lives. I am not a product of your time-traveling, but to me, you are like a product of my time-traveling." The Master of the Wheel of Reincarnation's face remained unchanged, his eyes calm and serene as he spoke.

Han Li heard these words, and his brow furrowed in confusion. He then became enraged.

Although the path of the immortal was long and arduous, Han Li had already walked a very long way. But the memories of his past in the mortal realm and the spiritual realm were still etched in his mind.

Qu Xuan, Mo Daifu, Li Fei Yu, Yin Yue, Yuan Yao, Da Yuan Sheng Jun, Bao Hua... the people he had met, the experiences he had, were all etched into his bones. If he were to say that he was the product of the Master of the Wheel of Reincarnation's time-traveling, wouldn't those memories be just mere memories?

"No, it's impossible... you cultivated the Wheel of Reincarnation technique, how could you have mastered the technique of time-travel? In my opinion, everything you're saying is a lie, no... this is all just an illusion!" Han Li shook his head, saying.

As his voice fell, the purple glow in his eyes intensified, and his Nine Yin Magic Eyes were activated to their limits. He gazed around, but the surroundings remained unchanged, without a single hint of variation.

"Bottle Spirit, Bottle Spirit... take me away from here, use time-travel, go anywhere, just leave this place..." Han Li's heart was screaming, his mind in turmoil.

"Han Li..." At this moment, a clear voice echoed in Han Li's mind, and it was the Bottle Spirit's voice.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat, and his turbulent emotions suddenly calmed down.

"He's not lying to you, not just you, but even I am a product of his time-traveling. He traveled back in time, and the flow of time changed, and a new Han Li was born in the mountain village, and that's you." The Bottle Spirit's words were like a sharp sword, piercing Han Li's heart.

"What's going on here?" Han Li's mind was more confused than ever, and he muttered to himself.

"I started from the mortal realm, grew up in the spiritual realm, relying on my four spiritual roots, and eventually stepped onto the path of immortality... when I finally reached the pinnacle of the time law, I threatened the position of the Time Dao Ancestor of the past and present... and in the end, I was defeated, and was about to be killed. At that moment, I scattered all my time law power, used up all my time dao threads and crystals, and gathered this immense power of time in the Palm of Heaven Bottle. After that, the bottle produced its first true reversal of time and space, and brought me back to a time even more ancient than the past." The Master of the Wheel of Reincarnation's calm gaze finally showed a hint of darkness, and he spoke slowly.

"When his time law power was infused into the Palm of Heaven Bottle, a series of changes occurred, and my spirit was born. At that time, it was still very weak, and after a long period of time, it finally transformed into the Bottle Spirit." The Bottle Spirit added.

Han Li heard these words, and finally calmed down completely. He thought for a long time before saying:

"So, it seems that I am myself, and you are yourself. We each took different paths in our cultivation."

"You can think of it that way. Because I performed a time-travel that had never been done before, many of your experiences may have changed due to my existence. It's as if you were supposed to meet Gan Ruoxue, but instead met Nan Gong Wan. Your connections to the Demon Realm, the Gray Realm, and the Barbarian Realm are much deeper than mine. It can be said that from the moment you entered the Immortal Realm, our paths diverged more and more, and it's almost as if we lived two separate lives." The Master of the Wheel of Reincarnation said.

"But how did you become the Master of the Wheel of Reincarnation?" Han Li asked, his brow furrowed in concern.

"I traveled back in time to an era before your birth, and abandoned my time law power. I was almost reduced to a cripple. What was despairing was that Guo or Jin had already occupied the position of Time Dao Ancestor. If I continued to cultivate my time law power, I would still be defeated by him. So, I switched to cultivating the Wheel of Reincarnation technique, and that's how I became who I am today." The Master of the Wheel of Reincarnation replied.

"What about my mother and me?" Jiao San asked, his face pale, his heart shaken.

(Note: The translation is quite long, so I'll stop here. Let me know if you want me to continue translating the rest of the chapter.)
The Lord of the Revival Hall turned around and looked at her and Nan Gong Wan with a gentle gaze.

"Back then, your mother had just given birth to you, and Guo or Jin had already arrived, killing everyone. Your mother sacrificed herself to give us time to escape, leaving only a part of her Revival power sealed within you. And I, to protect you, used the power of the Time Law to seal you within a jade ring, and fought against Guo or Jin while retreating. In the end, I had no choice but to activate the Heaven-Shaking Bottle, hoping to use my life's worth of Time Law power to shatter it, and exchange it for a mutual destruction with Guo or Jin..."

"Back then, you were carrying me with you?" Jiao San asked, disbelieving.

"I had already given up hope, thinking that you and I would be destroyed together, but unexpectedly, the small bottle gave birth to a Bottle Spirit, and also gave birth to the unprecedented ability of Space-Time Leap, causing me to truly leap through time, and thus avoid the pursuit of the Time Dao Ancestor," the Lord of the Revival Hall said.

"Jiao San and you crossed over together?" Han Li's eyes flashed with surprise.

"Yes," the Lord of the Revival Hall nodded and said.

"Your words may sound like a fantasy, but they are full of loopholes and are not worth believing," Han Li said, taking a deep breath, and scolding.

Jiao San also looked at the Lord of the Revival Hall with a disbelieving expression.

"If Jiao San crossed over with you to the distant past, with her talent, how could she be at her current level? And how could the Heaven-Shaking Bottle, such a precious treasure, leave your side and be lost? The Time Dao Ancestor is the one standing at the pinnacle of time, if you can leap through time, why can't he?" Han Li asked, pouring out his questions.

"Before I answer your last question, I'd like to ask you one, do you know what the Heaven-Shaking Bottle is?" the Lord of the Revival Hall asked.

Han Li wanted to answer that it was a Time Law object, but he didn't say it out loud, knowing that it was more complex than that.

"In fact, until now, I'm not even sure what the Heaven-Shaking Bottle is, or what kind of power it contains. The law contained within it is not just the Time Law, otherwise, even with my life's worth of Time Law power, it wouldn't have given birth to the Bottle Spirit, or produced the Space-Time Leap ability," the Lord of the Revival Hall said.

"You're saying that the Time Dao Ancestor, although he controls the Time Law power, can't just use that power to leap through time?" Han Li asked.

"Space-Time Leap crosses not just time, but also space, and even the power of Revival, so except for the Heaven-Shaking Bottle, I'm afraid there's no other power that can achieve Space-Time Leap. That means, as long as you have the Heaven-Shaking Bottle, you're the only one in this world who can possibly achieve Space-Time Leap," the Lord of the Revival Hall said.

Han Li listened to these words, and without needing to ask the Bottle Spirit, he already believed seven parts of it.

"As for the Nine Truths and the small bottle, it's related to another Dao Ancestor, Chen Yun," the Lord of the Revival Hall said.

Han Li had never heard of this name before, and his eyes flashed with a hint of confusion.

"The Heavenly Court, led by the Time Dao Ancestor Guo or Jin, joined forces with six other Dao Ancestors to form the 'Seven Heavenly Lords', jointly governing the True Immortal Realm. Among them, you should know only Li Yuan Yu of the Nine Truths Observatory. Chen Yun is the most mysterious of the seven, the Prophecy Dao Ancestor," the Lord of the Revival Hall said.

"Prophecy Law?" Han Li's brow furrowed, saying.

Han Li had only heard of the Prophecy Law, knowing it was mysterious and difficult to cultivate, but he never thought there was such a Dao Ancestor.

"Back then, when I leaped through time, I had exhausted my power, and couldn't control the small bottle. The Heaven-Shaking Bottle was lost in the River of Time. Without the protection of the law, I was consumed by the chaotic flow of time and space, and I lost all my immortal energy. I and the Nine Truths were separated, and I returned to before my own birth, thousands of millions of years ago. The Nine Truths fell into a point in time not far from your birth. I could only find a distant and remote place to settle, and relying on my past experience, I sought out a small sect to take refuge in, and began to cultivate again... finally, after crossing the long and endless years, I found the Nine Truths, and rescued her. At that time, I had already re-cultivated the Revival Law, reached the peak of the Great Luo Realm, and established the Revival Hall. I then released her seal, and let her appear in the various immortal realms as Jiao San," the Lord of the Revival Hall said.

"If you had already rescued me, why didn't you recognize me?" Jiao San asked, unable to help but ask.

"It's precisely because of the existence of the Prophecy Dao Ancestor, that if I were to recognize you, a connection would be established between us, and Chen Yun would be able to sense me through the Prophecy Law, and then connect to you. The Heavenly Court can't find my trail, and they wouldn't let you go," the Lord of the Revival Hall said, looking at Jiao San with a hint of guilt in his eyes.
