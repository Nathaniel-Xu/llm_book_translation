Jin Dao, I don't know what you want to announce?" Yu Kuohai raised an eyebrow and asked.

"Everyone, if you want to enter the treasure tower and search for treasure, you must break open the stone door in front of you. To open the seal here, if I do it alone, it will take at least two days of effort. But if you all help me, we can break it in an instant." Jin Liu's eyes scanned the crowd, and he began to speak.

The crowd heard this and nodded in unison, glancing at each other, clearly remembering the scene when they collectively broke the formation earlier. They were afraid that they would become the sacrificial offerings to open the door.

Seeing that no one responded, Jin Liu's expression sank slightly, and he said slowly, "If you all want to reap the benefits without putting in any effort, I'm afraid there's no such good thing in this world?"

"Jin Dao, it's not that we're afraid of death, but please explain in detail how to break the formation, so that everyone can prepare mentally. Even if something happens, we can handle it ourselves." Yang Lao stepped forward and said.

"This formation is called the Yin-Yang Locking Formation. As long as you all use your spiritual energy on the door at the same time, making the originally balanced door hinges change, you can open the seal and enter." Jin Liu thought for a moment before explaining.

"Jin Dao, you make it sound easy, but isn't there any counter-seal or taboo on this door? What if we just make a move, and the formation counterattacks, resulting in a tragic outcome?" Yu Kuohai hesitated for a moment before speaking.

"I've checked, and this formation is different from the previous one. There's no unexpected situation. If you're still not at ease, I can break the formation with you all at the same time. If there's a change, I'll also suffer the counterattack." Jin Liu forced a smile onto his face.

"My brother has already explained everything, who is willing to take the initiative to break the formation?" Su Xi saw that no one responded, and she frowned.

The passageway was still silent, and Yu Kuohai and the others were all pretending to be deaf and dumb.

Jin Liu's smile slowly faded, and he said, "Since that's the case, I'll trouble you, Yu Dao, Yang Lao, Fu Gu Zhu, Zhao Fu Ge, and Qin Lou Zhu, to take the lead and have your respective sects send out some people to help me break the formation."

"Jin Dao..."

Yu Kuohai's words were cut off by Jin Liu's stern voice, "Since you've all joined the alliance, it's best to follow orders. Otherwise, once we leave this secret realm, the consequences will not be limited to just yourselves."

Yu Kuohai and the others understood the implication, that they would be seeking trouble for their entire sect in the future. Each of them had a slight change in expression.

"Qing Suo Valley is willing to follow orders." Fu Gu Zhu bowed his fist and said.

After that, he pointed and chose people from his sect.

The others looked at each other and also chose people.

"Also, each sect must choose someone who understands the art of breaking formations to listen to my instructions." Jin Liu's expression relaxed slightly as he reminded them.

Yu Kuohai heard this and his eyes shifted to Han Li.

"Shi Dao, my Ling Xian Men lacks people who understand formations, so I'll trouble you to take the lead for my Ling Xian Men." Yu Kuohai's face had a warm smile.

Yang Lao and Fu Gu Zhu exchanged a glance, and they both regretted not speaking earlier, allowing Yu Kuohai to take advantage of the situation and use "Shi Mu" as a scapegoat.

"This... isn't good, is it?" Han Li cursed inwardly, but his face showed a hesitant expression.

"Shi Dao, don't worry, after this is over, you can enter our Ling Xian Men and become an inner sect elder. You'll no longer be a wandering cultivator without a sect." Yu Kuohai patted Han Li's shoulder.

"Yu Dao, is this true?" Han Li pretended to be surprised.

"My words are not false, and there are all of you present as witnesses. Is there any reason for me to deceive you?" Yu Kuohai smiled.

"Then I'll take care of it this time." Han Li nodded.

A dozen steps away, the people from the Wang You Lou were watching. Blue Yan, who had transformed into a ordinary appearance, was looking at them.

"Brother, look at that poor guy, he's being lured by a small benefit and is willing to take the risk. It's really pitiful." Blue Yan's eyes flashed with a hint of mockery and pity as she transmitted her voice to Blue Yuanzi.

"A wandering cultivator's life is difficult, you don't understand. Becoming a Ling Xian Men elder is not a small benefit to him." Blue Yuanzi glanced at them and responded casually.

Blue Yan wanted to say something, but she heard the Wang You Lou's Zhao Fu Ge say, "You two, also participate in breaking the formation."

After a moment, each sect had chosen their people, and Jin Liu selected those who understood the art of breaking formations to explain the key points to them.

Han Li listened and sighed inwardly. If he followed Jin Liu's method, he would be walking into a trap, and it was likely to trigger the formation's counterattack.

However, with his current identity, he couldn't say anything.

When he returned to the Ling Xian Men group, Han Li reminded the people who were chosen to participate in breaking the formation, and the content was similar to what Jin Liu said. However, the details were slightly different, and ordinary people wouldn't notice.
About half a quarter of an hour later, the dozens of people who had been chosen to participate in breaking the array were already lined up on either side of the stone gate.

"Gentlemen, when breaking the array, you must use all your strength to urge on your spiritual energy, don't be lazy, or else if there's a mistake, don't blame me, Jin Liang, for punishing you." Jin Liang's face turned serious, and he spoke loudly.

"Yes." The crowd quickly responded.

"Alright, let's begin as I said before." Jin Liang ordered, and he took the lead in using his hand seals to send a water-blue light towards the stone gate.

The others followed closely behind, also using their hand seals to mobilize their spiritual energy and strike the stone gate.

Only to see the various colored lights, like a rainbow, gathering on the gate's different areas, the sunken gate nails began to shine, rising upwards, while the originally raised gate nails began to sink downwards.

The entire stone gate, with the gathered lights, gradually split into a yin-yang fish pattern that was constantly changing.

As the fish turned, the stone gate seemed to start loosening, with a fierce vibration, emitting a hissing sound.

"Gentlemen, add a bit more strength, the gate is about to open!" Jin Liang exclaimed with joy, shouting loudly.

The others, hearing his words, also became spirited, using all their strength to urge on their spiritual energy.

Han Li had been paying attention to the changes in the gate's restrictions, knowing that the current situation was just a precursor to the activation of the gate's restrictions. If they didn't do anything, within a few breaths, the crowd would be hit with a backlash.

As for the lives and deaths of these people, who were unrelated to him, he didn't have any particular concern.

The secret realm's treasure hunt was a situation where one's life was their own responsibility, and he had seen too many examples of this on his journey. No matter who it was, they had to be responsible for their own choices, and while seeking opportunities and good fortune, they also had to bear the risk of death.

However, the lives and deaths of these people were now connected to his own, and on another path, there was another team advancing. If they were blocked, and the other team got the treasure first, it wouldn't be a good situation.

As the yin-yang fish pattern spun faster and faster, the people participating in breaking the array suddenly had a change of heart. A few of them didn't follow Jin Liang's instructions, instead, they poured their spiritual energy into a few gate nails that he hadn't mentioned.

This caused the originally spinning fish pattern to suddenly jam, and it directly dispersed.

Jin Liang saw this, and his face turned red with anger. Just as he was about to scold them, his eyes suddenly flashed.

Only to see that the dispersed fish pattern, under the colorful light, had actually revealed a starry night sky.

His expression changed slightly, and he immediately understood that he had misjudged the array. He opened his mouth, shouting loudly: "The array has changed, listen to my commands, re-break the array..."

After that, he began to give step-by-step instructions, ordering the crowd to pour their spiritual energy into the gate nails once again.

"You're not stupid, otherwise, I wouldn't have to personally take action..." Han Li nodded to himself, thinking.

As the new instructions were given, the stone gate was filled with starlight, and the two statues of the divine soldiers holding the halberds suddenly changed, their halberds rising high, and the stone gate slowly opened.

"Rumble..."

A heavy friction sound slowly echoed, and the two thick stone gates gradually opened, revealing a golden light that shone from within, accompanied by a strange fluctuation.

The crowd's eyes were all drawn to the scene inside the gate, but they could only see a dazzling golden light, and even when using their spiritual eyes, they couldn't see what was inside.

"Is this golden light the treasure's aura...?" Yu Kuohai muttered.

As soon as he spoke, the crowd felt a surge of excitement, and their eyes all showed a hint of greed.

"It's not the treasure's aura, but rather the fluctuation of the Golden Force Field." Su Xi coldly laughed, speaking up.

"Su Xi, the Golden Force Field in the Golden Source Mountain Range is not uncommon, and its aura is something we can distinguish. The golden light inside the gate is so strong, it's clearly a treasure with a golden attribute." Yang Lao's eyebrows rose, saying.

Su Xi didn't explain, only smiling lightly.

Yang Lao saw this and felt a bit puzzled, wondering if he was really wrong.

Han Li's eyes scanned the inside of the gate, and he immediately understood.

The Golden Force Fields in the Golden Source Mountain Range were mostly naturally formed, without the addition of magical arrays, and the golden spiritual energy they emitted was strong, but not pure enough.

The golden light inside the gate, which seemed to be the treasure's aura, was actually because the golden energy within was concentrated and pure enough, which was why it was able to confuse the crowd.

The crowd stood at the gate, their hearts burning with desire to seize the treasure, but they didn't dare to directly charge in, partly because they feared the Tian Shui Sect's control, and partly because they were afraid of more mechanisms and restrictions inside.
