In the distant void, a long and low-pitched call suddenly echoed, followed by a series of desolate sounds that seemed to reverberate from far and near, making it difficult to discern their meaning. When Han Li listened carefully, he found that the sounds only had a tone, without any specific words, so he couldn't understand what they meant. However, as soon as he heard the sounds, he felt a surge of energy throughout his body.

"Could this be the ancient war song of the Barbarian Tribes?" Han Li wondered.

Just as he was pondering this, the sounds around him grew louder.

He turned to look at Xiao Bai beside him and found that the latter was also making low humming sounds in his throat.

"I don't know what's going on, but when I heard that desolate tone, I couldn't help but hum along..." Xiao Bai said to Han Li through their mental connection.

Han Li nodded and began to climb the mountain with Xiao Bai.

As soon as he took his first step onto the mountain path, he felt an inexplicable power enveloping him from all sides, making his footsteps feel heavy. However, this heaviness wasn't coming from outside, but rather from the mountain itself, which seemed to have turned into a magnet, exerting an attractive force that pulled all the climbers towards it.

This power wasn't too strong for Han Li, and he was able to walk without any hindrance.

The Tian Huo tribe and the Ban Shan tribe were also climbing without any issues, and their speed wasn't slow. They quickly reached the hundredth level.

Han Li and Xiao Bai's speed was comparable to that of the Tian Huo tribe, and when they looked back, they saw that there were still thousands of people standing on the mountain square below, not climbing.

"Le'er, why are those people staying at the foot of the mountain?" Han Li asked Liu Le'er through their mental connection.

"They're not among the top hundred tribes, and since they're affiliated with the Barbarian Tribes, they're allowed to stay at the foot of the mountain. Many other tribes can't even approach the mountain, let alone climb it," Liu Le'er replied.

"It seems that participating in the Blood Sacrifice Conference is a great honor," Han Li said.

"Indeed, the top hundred tribes that can climb the mountain all have some remnants of the Eight Ancient Kings' bloodline, which is why they're allowed to climb. That's why the King's permission for you to accompany Xiao Bai is quite unexpected, even to the tribe leader," Liu Le'er said.

Han Li raised an eyebrow and didn't say anything else.

After climbing several hundred more steps, ancient symbols began to appear on the stone platforms, and the climbers found that every time they stepped on the platforms, it was as if they were stuck in the mud, making it difficult to lift their feet. Many people's postures became awkward.

Except for the Tian Huo tribe and the Ban Shan tribe, who were able to maintain their original speed, the other tribes began to slow down, and the line of climbers grew longer.

Han Li, as a human, was able to climb at the same speed as the Tian Huo tribe, and he even seemed to be walking more easily than the others. This caught the attention of the other two tribes, who found it quite surprising.

One by one, they increased their speed, trying not to fall behind Han Li and lose face.

Han Li didn't have any competitive spirit, and he continued to climb with Xiao Bai at a leisurely pace.

At this point, a small white ape from the Ban Shan tribe, who had been walking with the others, suddenly stopped and approached Han Li and Xiao Bai.

The ape looked at Han Li and Xiao Bai with a mixture of curiosity and wariness.

Han Li, who had the bloodline of the mountain giant ape, found the ape's behavior quite endearing, so he smiled and approached the ape cautiously.

The Ban Shan tribe seemed to approve of the ape's actions, and they didn't try to stop it.

The ape's wariness was mainly directed towards Han Li, so when it approached, it went to the other side and tried to get closer to Xiao Bai.

"What's wrong with you, not staying with your own family, but coming over to bother us?" Xiao Bai asked gruffly.

"I heard that you have the bloodline of the Mò Yǎn Pí Xiū," the ape said.

"So what if I do?" Xiao Bai replied, not looking back.

"Our ancestors were one of the Eight Great True Spirit Kings, Yuán Hóng, and he was a close friend of the Mò Yǎn Pí Xiū, Mò Yù..." the ape said.

"What does that have to do with anything?" Xiao Bai asked, still climbing.

"They disappeared together, back in the day," the ape said.
Xiao Bai suddenly fell silent upon hearing this.

"What's your name?" Xiao Bai asked after a moment, turning to look at Xiao Bai Yuan.

"Yuan Shan Bai," Xiao Bai Yuan replied.

"You're Yuan Shan Bai, and I'm Xiao Bai... we really do have a bit of a connection," Xiao Bai said with a chuckle.

"Your name is Xiao Bai, Mo Xiao Bai?" Xiao Bai Yuan asked, raising an eyebrow.

Xiao Bai hesitated for a moment before nodding vaguely, not having regained his memories and not knowing his true name.

Han Li had been observing the exchange between the two young ones and felt a slight stirring in his heart upon seeing this scene.

Xiao Bai and Yuan Shan Bai began chatting and soon lost their previous gloomy demeanor. Xiao Bai's original carefree and bold personality returned, and he began to tease Yuan Shan Bai, who had never left his tribe and was clearly not yet an adult.

When Xiao Bai mentioned that he had an even more powerful senior, Yuan Shan Bai's eyes nearly sparkled with envy and admiration.

"Hey, don't worry! When we have the chance, I'll introduce you to my senior. She's not easy to get along with, but she's a righteous person. Just prepare some gifts for her, and once she acknowledges you as her junior, we'll look out for you together," Xiao Bai said with a grin, patting Yuan Shan Bai on the shoulder.

Han Li couldn't help but touch his nose, feeling a mix of emotions upon hearing Xiao Bai's words.

As they continued on their journey, Han Li's attention never wavered, carefully observing the changes in their surroundings.

As they climbed higher, the attractive force emanating from the stone steps grew stronger. Many tribes were unable to keep up with the Tian Huo tribe and the Bai Shan tribe, falling behind.

In addition to the attractive force, a powerful oppressive force began to emanate from the surrounding void, making it increasingly difficult for the Tian Huo tribe and the Bai Shan tribe to move forward.

When they reached the halfway point, the oppressive force had already surpassed the force at the foot of the mountain by a hundredfold. Han Li felt his breathing become labored, and the pressure was almost unbearable.

He slowed his pace, circulating the Tian Sha Zhen Yu Gong within his body, and only then did he feel the pressure ease slightly. He continued to ascend, his movements becoming more labored.

All the tribes except for the Tian Huo tribe and the Bai Shan tribe had fallen behind, and even those who had followed were now abandoning their ascent and instead taking the horizontal plank road to the platforms on either side of the mountain.

Han Li's gaze swept across the platforms, where he saw numerous stone pedestals resembling cushions. The members of the various tribes who had arrived at the platforms were sitting down, each choosing a pedestal.

The Tian Huo tribe and the Bai Shan tribe, however, showed no intention of stopping and continued to ascend.

It was strange that the Bai Shan tribe, whose physical strength should have been superior to that of the Tian Huo tribe, was actually falling behind.

Yuan Shan Bai, who had been chatting with Xiao Bai, was now walking at the front of the group.

As he saw his tribesmen falling behind, Yuan Shan Bai bid farewell to Xiao Bai and returned to the elderly Bai Shan tribe member's side, accompanying him as they continued their ascent.

The Tian Huo tribe members and the Bai Shan tribe members were mostly silent, occasionally glancing at Han Li with a mixture of confusion and curiosity.

In reality, only Han Li himself knew that the pressure exerted on him was almost equivalent to that of a mighty mountain, and that every step he took left a faint impression on the stone steps.

As they continued on their journey, Han Li noticed that Xiao Bai was also reaching his limit, his movements becoming increasingly labored.

Han Li slowed his pace, accompanying Xiao Bai as they ascended.

The Tian Huo tribe members gradually surpassed them, walking ahead, and Han Li's heart felt a sense of relief.

Han Li glanced at Liu Le'er, who was stopped in front of them, looking back with a questioning gaze.

"You go ahead with Liu Qing, we'll catch up later," Han Li transmitted to her.

Liu Le'er hesitated for a moment before continuing on with Liu Qing's urging.

"How about I help you?" Han Li asked, knowing that Xiao Bai's true strength as a Mo Xiao Bai had not yet awakened.

"No need, according to Xiao Bai Yuan, climbing this mountain is a test of the Eight Kings' bloodline. The thicker the bloodline, the more courageous one can be. I won't let my bloodline be ashamed," Xiao Bai said, shaking his head.

He then lifted his head, his eyes shining with determination as he gazed towards the mountain peak, continuing his ascent.

Han Li looked at Xiao Bai's eyes and saw a faint golden glow, but it vanished in an instant. He smiled and continued on his way.
