The young man, hand over a copy of the "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique" to me. Don't worry, I and Miro Old Ancestor are friends, and I won't let you suffer. This is the "Five Thunder Orthodox Scripture" that I obtained from an ancient relic, it's the ultimate thunder law of this realm, and it's not inferior to your "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique".

Hei Tianmo turned around and looked at Han Li, flipped his hand and took out a purple jade slip, tossing it over.

Han Li's face changed, and he stretched out his hand to catch the jade slip. In his heart, he was thinking of a countermeasure.

This Hei Tianmo was crazy and unpredictable, and couldn't be judged by normal reasoning. Now, he seemed to have believed Qi Mozi's words, and he needed to be cautious.

One wrong move, and he would provoke the other party's anger.

"Stone Senior, don't believe this person, Qi Mozi is a member of the Heavenly Court, and he's also the master of the Heavenly Prison. His words are probably false, and he wants to deceive you into going to the Heavenly Court, where the Heavenly Court's ancestors, even the Time Ancestor, will deal with you. We are members of the Wheel of Reincarnation Temple, and we are our own people."

Before Han Li could speak, a sudden voice came from the crowd, and Jiao San walked out, his face flashing with a red light, revealing his Wheel of Reincarnation Temple mask.

"Time Ancestor... ancient or modern!" Hei Tianmo's body shook, and unexpectedly, he didn't become enraged. His face, which was previously twisted in a frenzy, slightly returned to normal, and he seemed to regain some of his rationality.

"I'm a member of the Heavenly Court? That's a joke! Stone Senior has seen many things, and he should know what kind of person I am. You people from the Wheel of Reincarnation Temple are trying to stop me from rescuing Jin Ling and Shi Gongzi. What's your motive?"

Qi Mozi seemed to have anticipated that someone would say this, and his expression didn't change. He coldly smiled and said.

"If we look at the cultivation technique, it's indeed the "Breaking Time Flowing Fire Collection" from the True Words Sect, not a technique from the Heavenly Court."

Hei Tianmo looked at Qi Mozi, seemingly muttering to himself.

"Stone Senior, please understand." Qi Mozi immediately said, not giving Jiao San and Han Li any opportunity to interrupt.

At the same time, he raised his hand and waved it, and three dry corpses appeared in front of him. They were the three Eagle Nose Demon Devils.

"Stone Senior, these three demons were once your subordinates, but they betrayed you and caused you to be imprisoned. I killed them, and the other two have already died in the Five Elements Oblivion Array. You can also take revenge."

Qi Mozi said this to Hei Tianmo, trying to gain his favor.

Hei Tianmo saw the three demon corpses and became enraged, his face twisted in anger.

"Hmph! Ungrateful traitors! I treated you five as my own, and yet you betrayed me at the most critical moment! You should die!"

Hei Tianmo's body shook, and he slapped his palm, releasing a black light that exploded the three demon corpses, turning them into dust.

Han Li and Jiao San saw Qi Mozi trying to win Hei Tianmo's favor, and they exchanged a glance, both thinking that they were in a difficult situation. However, they didn't understand Hei Tianmo's nature, and they couldn't think of a way to win him over.

"Quickly hand over the "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique" to me, and I'll forget about your previous offense."

Hei Tianmo's face was still twisted in anger, but he turned to Han Li and said.

"If Senior wants my technique, I won't refuse. However, my "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique" is incomplete, and my master only taught me the first half of the technique. I'm afraid that even if I give it to you, it won't be of any use."

Han Li's thoughts were racing, and he quickly said.

"What? Incomplete?" Hei Tianmo's expression changed, and he frowned.

"Senior, don't worry. Although I haven't learned the complete "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique", I know where the complete technique is. The True Words Sect has been destroyed by the Heavenly Court, and my master sealed the sect's high-level techniques in a certain location. However, that location is special, and one needs a powerful time treasure to enter. I came to the Tai Sui Temple to obtain the Sui Yue God Lamp, which will allow me to retrieve the second half of the technique. If Senior trusts me, please lend me the lamp, and I'll retrieve the complete technique within ten years. If Senior doesn't trust me, we can go together."

Han Li spoke quickly, not giving Qi Mozi any opportunity to interrupt.

Qi Mozi heard Han Li's words and secretly cursed him for being cunning, using his previous words to turn the tables.

However, Hei Tianmo's expression slightly improved after hearing Han Li's words.

"Han Li, I saw your master teach you the complete "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique" back then. You dare to lie to Stone Senior? The technique is either in your storage treasure or your memory, and it's easy to check."

Qi Mozi saw Hei Tianmo's expression and felt that something was wrong, so he quickly said.

"Qi Mozi, you want to check my storage treasure? Feel free to take it, but I also want to see what's in your storage treasure. I believe there's something that can prove your identity."

Han Li heard Qi Mozi's words and smiled, taking down his storage treasure.

Qi Mozi was taken aback, and he secretly regretted his previous words. He had many Heavenly Court treasures in his storage treasure, including the Heavenly Prison master's identity token.

However, showing weakness now would undo all his previous efforts.

"Hmph! What's there to be afraid of? If we're going to check, then everyone should check, so that we can avoid someone with ulterior motives muddying the waters."

Qi Mozi coldly smiled and took down his storage ring, his words hinting at stirring up trouble.

He had two storage treasures, and this ring only contained some emergency items for battle. The Heavenly Prison master's identity token was in his other storage treasure, which was hidden.

Han Li might not be able to find it.

Hei Tianmo's mind was already muddled, and he grew impatient with the two people's argument.

Just as he was about to scold them, he suddenly turned around and looked outside.
"What person is lurking outside, get out here!" Black Heaven Demon God sneered, raising his hand to grab at the void.

Below the halfway point of the towering peak, the heaven and earth's primal energy collapsed and gathered, instantly forming a massive black palm that covered the sky and blocked out the sun, grabbing at a certain location in the void with lightning speed.

That location in the void "exploded" with a loud noise, and a golden figure stumbled out, it was Qu Lin, caught by the black palm.

Before he could even try to struggle, the black palm disappeared into thin air, leaving Qu Lin to fall to the ground.

 Inside the Hall of Ages, the void shook and the black palm reappeared, its size greatly reduced, and it released Qu Lin.

"Ah, it's you, little bug! Haha, it's been a long time since I've beaten someone up, my hands are itching, and you just happened to deliver yourself to my doorstep." Black Heaven Demon God's anger turned to joy as he saw Qu Lin, his figure flashing and disappearing.

Qu Lin's front was shaken by a void fluctuation, and Black Heaven Demon God reappeared, punching Qu Lin with a single fist.

Seeing this, Qu Lin's face revealed a terrified expression, and he let out a loud shout, his body flashing with golden light as he transformed into his true form, a massive golden beetle over ten feet in size.

Two sharp claws swung down, releasing a wave of golden light that intersected and formed a dense golden shadow, striking Black Heaven Demon God's body.

Black Heaven Demon God didn't dodge, allowing the golden light to strike him, but his body suddenly turned into a phantom, and the golden light passed through him without causing any harm.

Black Heaven Demon God's actions didn't change, and he continued to punch Qu Lin, striking the golden beetle's head.

A loud crash echoed out!

Black Heaven Demon God's fist suddenly turned solid, and he punched the golden beetle, sending it flying and crashing into the nearby wall, causing a massive shockwave.

The walls of the Hall of Ages were made of special materials, and although they didn't have any restrictive formations, they were still very difficult to break.

Tian Tian Sword Sect and the others happened to be standing nearby, and Dao Yin True Person hadn't woken up yet. Lei Yuze and the others saw this and quickly moved to the side, taking Dao Yin True Person with them.

The golden beetle crashed into the wall, fell to the ground, and looked around in confusion, as if it had been dazed.

A shallow fist print appeared on its incredibly hard exoskeleton, but it didn't crack.

"Ah, your shell is even harder now, great, let me loosen up my muscles!" Black Heaven Demon God's figure reappeared beside the golden beetle, and he punched it again.

The golden beetle's body flashed with golden light, and it suddenly shrunk to the size of a fist, transforming into a small golden insect. It shot forward with incredible speed, its wings buzzing.

"You think you can run?" Black Heaven Demon God's figure flashed, and he appeared in front of the golden insect, his fist striking it with lightning speed.

A loud crash echoed out, and the golden insect was sent flying again, crashing into another wall and causing a massive shockwave.

The golden insect's body was now half-covered in golden light, and its size returned to its original state. "Haha, it's been a long time since I've felt this good! It's been a long time since I've felt this satisfied!" Black Heaven Demon God said, nodding his head, his figure blurring and reappearing beside the golden beetle, punching it again.

The golden beetle was sent flying once more, crashing into a wall and falling to the ground.

This time, it was struck on the body, and its head wasn't dazed. As soon as it landed, it immediately prostrated itself on the ground.

"Senior Shi, Lord Shi, I was wrong, I shouldn't have been spying on you, please forgive me this time!" The golden beetle didn't try to escape, instead begging for mercy.

"No, I haven't had enough yet, what are you yelling about?" Black Heaven Demon God sneered, his figure reappearing beside the golden beetle, and he kicked it again.

He had just been annoyed by Han Li and Qimozi's words, which were related to his wife and children, and he could only endure it. But his heart was already burning with anger, and Qu Lin had unknowingly delivered himself to his doorstep.

The golden beetle became a sandbag, being beaten by Black Heaven Demon God's fists and feet, flying back and forth in the great hall.

Black Heaven Demon God didn't use any law attacks, only using his physical strength to punch and kick Qu Lin. Qu Lin's body was incredibly resilient, and he didn't take any damage, but his body was flying back and forth in the great hall, leaving behind a trail of golden light.

Everywhere it passed, a large crater would appear.

The entire seventh floor was in chaos, with rocks flying everywhere, and the sound of screams and explosions echoed through the air.
