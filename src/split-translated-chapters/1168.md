Lyuluer saw Han Li nod and happily led him forward, soon arriving at an entrance to the building complex.

"Miss Lyuluer!"

Four guards in cyan armor, holding weapons, stood at attention and bowed respectfully to Lyuluer.

Han Li observed the scene and nodded to himself.

These four guards were not weak, having reached the mid-to-late stage of the Gold Immortal realm, yet they showed such respect to Lyuluer. It seemed that Lyuluer held a high position in the Tian Huo clan, which put Han Li at ease.

Lyuluer didn't acknowledge the guards and quickly walked inside, seeming a bit impatient. She still retained some of her lively and playful demeanor from her youth.

Han Li was about to follow when the four guards blocked his path with their weapons.

"Stop right there, sir!"

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he stopped in his tracks.

"What are you doing?" Lyuluer noticed the situation and frowned, her face icy cold.

"Miss Lyuluer, please forgive us, but this is the Tian Huo clan's residence. This cultivator is not a member of our clan, and he needs to obtain permission from Elder Mu to enter." The most senior guard explained, bowing respectfully.

"Hmph! He's my brother, and I'll explain to Elder Mu. Now, get out of my way!" Lyuluer said coldly.

"Miss Lyuluer, we have orders to guard this place. Please don't make it difficult for us." The guard leader hesitated, but still didn't back down.

"You're being unreasonable!" Lyuluer's anger flared, and she grasped her hand.

A gray-white light burst out, entwining the guards' weapons, and then flung them aside.

Han Li's eyes lit up, and he felt a mix of surprise and curiosity.

Lyuluer seemed to be wearing a treasure that concealed her cultivation, which he hadn't noticed earlier. Now, he saw that her cultivation had reached the Taiyi realm, although only at the early stage. Her progress was astonishing, considering her cultivation was far inferior to his in the past.

The four guards simultaneously shouted, and their bodies glowed with light as they gripped their weapons tightly.

Although they were only at the Gold Immortal realm, they seemed to have mastered a cooperative technique, their movements swift and synchronized as they released a powerful aura that countered Lyuluer's attack. However, they all spat out blood from their mouths.

Lyuluer had just advanced to the Taiyi realm, and her internal energy was unstable. Her first attack had failed, and her face fell, her gray-white light surging as she prepared to strike again.

"Stop!"

Just then, a stern voice echoed, and a massive power appeared between Lyuluer and the guards, separating them.

A gray-robed elder with white hair and piercing eyes appeared out of nowhere.

Han Li looked at the elder, his eyes flashing with insight, and he secretly activated his Lei Peng bloodline to conceal his identity as a human cultivator.

The elder's appearance was unassuming, but his aura was profound, and he was clearly a powerful existence at the Da Luo realm.

"Elder Mu!" The four guards quickly sheathed their weapons and bowed respectfully.

"Elder Mu." Lyuluer also bowed.

"What are you doing, fighting at the entrance of our residence? What kind of image are you presenting?" Elder Mu scolded.

"Yes, sir. We were just following orders. Miss Lyuluer brought this stranger to the residence without permission, so we tried to stop him." The guard leader explained.

"Elder Mu, he's my brother, and he saved my life in the past. He's not a stranger..." Lyuluer began to explain.

"Enough, I know everything. Continue to guard the entrance. Lyuluer, bring your brother inside." Elder Mu raised his hand, interrupting Lyuluer, and instructed the guards before glancing at Han Li with a hint of mockery in his eyes.

Han Li noticed the elder's expression and furrowed his brow, but said nothing, following Lyuluer inside.

After turning a few corners, they arrived at a grand hall.

The hall was decorated with expensive materials, and it seemed to be a reception area.

"Lyuluer, the Blood Sacrifice Conference will be held soon, and this is the most critical moment. Every moment counts, and you can't afford to waste time. Why did you sneak out? You've already delayed for so long, and the clan leader is not pleased. Hurry back to the Tian Huo palace!" Elder Mu's face turned stern as soon as they entered the hall.

Han Li listened to the elder's words, his eyes flashing with insight, but he remained silent.
Han Li stood before the grand hall, his eyes fixed on the gray-robed elder. "Is it true that you've come to the Tian Huo Tribe seeking refuge?" the elder asked, his voice devoid of warmth.

Han Li's expression remained calm as he replied, "I've come to visit my friend, Liu Le'er. I didn't mean to intrude upon your tribe's affairs."

The gray-robed elder's gaze turned cold, his eyes narrowing as he said, "You're not welcome here, Han Li. You're a human cultivator, and your presence is a threat to our tribe's safety. Leave now, and don't return."

Han Li's eyes flickered with a hint of disappointment, but he didn't argue. He turned to leave, but the gray-robed elder's words stopped him. "Wait, Han Li. You're not leaving that easily."

The elder's hands moved, and a gray-white glow enveloped the hall, blocking Han Li's path. "You're not going anywhere until you explain your true intentions," the elder said, his voice dripping with malice.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, his hand instinctively reaching for the sleeve of his robe. He could feel the power of the Five Elements surging within him, ready to be unleashed at a moment's notice.

Just as the situation was about to escalate, a voice boomed from the shadows, "Enough, Mu Zhang!"

A figure emerged from the darkness, a middle-aged man in white robes with an air of authority about him. The gray-robed elder immediately bowed, acknowledging the newcomer's superior status.

Han Li's eyes widened as he recognized the man. It was the same person he had met in the Gray Realm, the one who had left a lasting impression on him.

The man's eyes locked onto Han Li, and for a moment, they simply stared at each other. Han Li could sense the man's power, a power that rivaled even the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor.

The air was thick with tension as the two men stood there, their eyes locked in a silent challenge. Han Li's mind racing with thoughts of the past, he knew that this encounter would be far from ordinary.
