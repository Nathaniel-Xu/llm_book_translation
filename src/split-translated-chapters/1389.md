"Really? That's great!"

Nan Gong Wan was initially delighted, but then seemed to think of something, and looked around hesitantly before asking:

"What about him..."

"He used all his strength to activate the Wheel of Reincarnation, forcing out the divine soul of Guo or Jin, and completely merging it with the Heavenly Way." Han Li sighed slightly and said.

Nan Gong Wan's eyes widened slightly upon hearing this, and her eyes became moist.

She pointed to her own brow, and then pulled outwards, pulling out a faint, ghostly shadow.

Han Li's eyes scanned the area, and he immediately recognized it as the last remaining fragment of Gan Ru Shuang's soul, which was extremely weak and unstable, like a flickering candle flame.

At this moment, a dark red glow flashed on a nearby broken object, and a wisp of residual soul flew out.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed slightly, and a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes, as he discovered that the Wheel of Reincarnation still had a remaining fragment, which had stored a wisp of the Wheel of Reincarnation's master's soul.

The soul's shadow was also faint and ethereal, but after flying out, it immediately flew towards Gan Ru Shuang's divine soul, and grasped her shoulder.

The two of them leaned against each other, and looked back at Nan Gong Wan and Han Li, a hint of a smile on their faces.

"Take care of Jiu Zhen for me, and the world will be at peace..." Han Li seemed to hear the Wheel of Reincarnation's master's voice in his mind.

Before he could respond, the two shadows had already slowly risen into the air, their light growing dimmer and dimmer, until they finally dispersed into the air like a wisp of smoke.

"I will." Han Li silently replied in his heart.

"Is this a good ending for them?" Nan Gong Wan leaned against Han Li's shoulder, her expression tinged with sadness, and asked.

Han Li heard her words, and for a moment, didn't know how to respond, and simply shook his head slightly.

Just then, he frowned slightly, and turned to look at the Demon Master, saying:

"Shi Dao friend, must you be so impatient? We just went through a life-and-death battle together, can't we cherish this rare opportunity to live?"

Nan Gong Wan heard this, and quickly turned to look, and saw that the Demon Master had already quietly appeared beside the Palm of Heaven, and had grasped it in his hand, his eyebrows furrowed in concern.

"Han Dao friend has misunderstood something, I didn't join forces with you to oppose Guo or Jin's actions. On the contrary, I actually agree with his views, but unfortunately, he achieved them before I did." The Demon Master said calmly.

Han Li looked at him, and said to Nan Gong Wan: "I'll let you go back first, and wait for me for a bit."

"You be careful." Nan Gong Wan hesitated for a moment, before deciding to trust Han Li, and nodded.

"I won't be long." Han Li said, and waved his hand, opening the silver light gate, and sending Nan Gong Wan back to the Flower Branch Cave Heaven.

"Strong cultivators strive to reach the heavens, and experience countless tribulations and calamities, all for the sake of being able to do as they please. But then there's the Heavenly Way, which suppresses them, making it hard for them to breathe. You, Han Li, had your left arm devoured by the Heavenly Way, don't you want to overthrow this annoying Heavenly Way?" The Demon Master didn't stop Han Li's actions, and instead, pointed at the sky, saying proudly.

"I once read a phrase in a mortal book, 'to do as one pleases without overstepping the bounds'. I don't know if you've heard it, Shi Dao friend? Under the Heavenly Way's rules, strong cultivators can do as they please. But if everyone struggles to become stronger without following the Heavenly Way, wouldn't the world become chaotic and disorderly, without the mortal world's starlight, without the mountain's flourishing flowers, without the sky's bright moon, what would be the point of this world?" Han Li smiled and asked.

"I didn't expect Han Dao friend to be such a hegemon, with the compassion of a woman?" The Demon Master laughed loudly, his voice echoing through the heavens, and not fading away.

"Is it necessary to fight?" Han Li smiled and asked.

"It's not that it's necessary to fight, but that you, Han Li, must die. You're too heavily injured, and if I don't kill you now, I'll never have a peaceful day again." The Demon Master's face was still smiling, but his voice was like cold frost, and his words were like a knife.

As he finished speaking, his body retreated a step, and he vanished into a spatial ripple.

Han Li had expected this, and the time laws on his body fluctuated wildly, as he waved his hand, and the space around him froze.

He looked around, and saw a small crack in the space, and raised his hand, stabbing out with his sword.

A "zhi la" sound echoed through the air, as a golden electric light shot out, and entered the crack.

The frozen time began to flow again, and the crack in the space began to widen, as a loud explosion shook the air.

"It seems you're really not lightly injured..." A voice suddenly came from behind Han Li.

Han Li didn't have time to turn around, as a silver light shot down, and a powerful spatial law wrapped around him, trapping him in place.

"Go with them!"

A loud shout echoed through the air, as the Demon Master's five fingers, wrapped in demonic energy, flashed with silver light, and shot towards Han Li's head.
Han Li had almost exhausted his entire reserve of law and spiritual energy when he previously killed Guo or Jin. At this moment, he was truly unable to avoid the attack.

Just as the situation was at a critical juncture, a golden light flashed before him, and a gigantic golden beetle suddenly flew out, charging straight at the Demon Lord.

A loud, muffled sound echoed through the air as the Demon Lord was directly knocked back.

After blocking the fatal blow, the golden beetle turned around and bit into the void, forcibly tearing apart the spatial law energy surrounding Han Li.

"Xi Jin Xian... Dao Zu!" the Demon Lord exclaimed in shock after stabilizing his body.

He only knew that Han Li had a Xi Jin Xian by his side, but he didn't expect it to have advanced to the Dao Zu stage. During the previous great war, the Xi Jin Xian had not revealed itself, and the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation had not informed him of this.

The Demon Lord's injuries were not severe, but he had consumed a large amount of energy to kill Guo or Jin. Facing Han Li and the golden beetle together, he didn't think he had much of a chance. However, he had already become irreconcilable with Han Li, and if he couldn't eliminate him today, the situation would only worsen once Han Li recovered.

He unconsciously glanced at the small bottle in his hand, and a silver light flashed within his palm.

The mouth of the small bottle emitted a silver light, and numerous silver threads flowed out, entering his palm.

The Demon Lord's eyes widened, and a look of uncontainable joy flashed across his face.

He felt a surge of powerful spatial law energy flowing into his body from the small bottle, replenishing his depleted dantian.

"Haha... Heaven is helping me, Heaven is helping me..." the Demon Lord laughed with glee.

Han Li, however, was not surprised. In fact, his hand, which was hidden in his sleeve, was rapidly forming a seal.

Although he had not been able to refine the small bottle earlier, he had established a deep connection with it. Controlling it from a distance was not a problem.

At this moment, it was not the Demon Lord who was absorbing the spatial law energy, but rather Han Li manipulating the small bottle, forcefully pouring the energy into his body.

The Demon Lord soon stopped laughing.

He discovered that as more spatial law energy flowed out, the chaotic law energy mixed within began to penetrate his body.

When he tried to stop it, it was too late.

"Han Li, you..."

He only managed to utter half a sentence before his body began to swell and explode, with chaotic light balls bursting out of his body, tearing his flesh apart.

A silver light condensed into a miniature eight-wheeled chariot, driven by a silver divine soul, attempted to escape.

"You can't escape... Let me send you on your way." Han Li sighed, saying.

As soon as he finished speaking, a layer of time ripples spread out, and the void froze once more. The eight-wheeled chariot was trapped, unable to move.

Han Li, unaffected, walked over and reached out to capture the chariot and the Demon Lord's divine soul.

His expression unchanged, he simply pinched the chariot and the divine soul, causing them to disintegrate into a faint, ethereal light that vanished into nothingness.

Han Li looked around, taking in the chaotic void, and his emotions were complicated.

After a moment, he slowly withdrew his gaze, raised his hand, and recalled the small bottle, gently stroking its familiar patterns. His mind gradually calmed down.

At this moment, the small bottle's dark green leaf pattern emitted a golden light, and threads of time law energy flowed out, slowly pouring into Han Li's body, nourishing his every celestial orifice.

Han Li's fatigue dissipated, and the light in his eyes grew brighter.

He could even feel the residual influence of the chaotic laws slowly receding, and the disrupted Heavenly Way gradually returning to its normal course. The heavens and earth were purifying, and everything was slowly recovering its original vitality.

However, when he looked up, the void rift he had created above his head showed no signs of healing.

It seemed as though time had stopped, space was frozen, and the cycle of reincarnation was not involved. The rift would likely remain forever, a scar in the hearts of all True Immortals, a testament to this ancient calamity.

The shattered Middle Earth Realm would never return to its original state, and most of its territories had been completely destroyed. Many areas had fallen into the void during the previous battle, becoming lost realms like the Small Southern Zhou Realm.

However, the dense heavenly energy in the area, which had been disrupted by the Heavenly Way's operation, began to replenish itself, and it was likely that the scattered fragments would reassemble into a small continent, becoming a secret realm, after a hundred million years.

Similarly, other realms affected by the calamity were gradually recovering and healing.

(For mortals, the grand finale is approaching. I will update more frequently over the next two days.)
