After half a day's busy work, the Guan Yin Tian Xuan Grand Array was finally repaired and once again shone with a brilliant light.

Han Li took out all the Xian Yuan stones from his body and placed them beside the Guan Yin Tian Xuan Grand Array, providing energy for the array to operate.

After completing these tasks, he sat down cross-legged beside the grand array, hesitating for a moment before opening his Spiritual Domain, covering the Guan Yin Tian Xuan Grand Array.

He didn't open his Spiritual Domain too wide, only covering an area of about 20-30 zhang around him, as the larger the Spiritual Domain, the more energy it consumed.

Tie Hun, who was standing not far away, was also covered by the Spiritual Domain.

Seeing Han Li open his Spiritual Domain, Tie Hun's face showed a hint of surprise, clearly not understanding Han Li's intentions, but she didn't make a sound to disturb him.

Han Li glanced at Tie Hun with his peripheral vision, but didn't let her leave, instead muttering to himself as the Spiritual Domain's golden light flashed, and the five treasures, the Zhen Yan Bao Lun, the Duan Shi Huo Bao, and others, appeared out of thin air.

The Zhen Yan Bao Lun and the Duan Shi Huo Bao flew up into the sky, transforming into a golden round moon and a golden sun, the Huan Chen Sha Lao fell to the ground, transforming into a golden sea of sand, the Dong Yi Shen Mu sank into the sand sea, and the sand and earth split open, revealing a lush forest, the Guan Yin Jing Ping's light flashed, transforming into a golden river, flowing rapidly.

In an instant, Han Li's Spiritual Domain had almost become a real world, with only the sand sea and the golden river seeming slightly illusory.

At this moment, the Zhen Yan Bao Lun, which had transformed into a golden round moon, suddenly descended, hovering above the Guan Yin Tian Xuan Grand Array.

The Guan Yin Tian Xuan Grand Array's light surged, rapidly operating, and the Zhen Yan Bao Lun also burst forth with several times its original light, rapidly operating, but in the opposite direction, the two resonating with each other.

At this moment, the Spiritual Domain's space was also filled with the sound of wind, golden sand flying up, the golden river's waves churning, the golden sun's flames blazing, and the lush forest's leaves dancing wildly, the five Time Laws' powers fiercely colliding.

Han Li's brow furrowed, his Spiritual Domain once again escaping his control, automatically operating.

However, having experienced this before, he didn't panic, allowing the Spiritual Domain and the Guan Yin Tian Xuan Grand Array to resonate together.

A loud explosion suddenly erupted, a blinding golden light bursting forth from the Zhen Yan Bao Lun, transforming into a golden wave that swept across the entire Spiritual Domain.

As the golden light spread, the Guan Yin Tian Xuan Grand Array also burst forth with a wave of time, the two merging into one.

The entire Spiritual Domain's space, with its five fiercely colliding Time Laws' powers, rapidly calmed down, everything returning to tranquility, but the Spiritual Domain's time flow speed rapidly accelerated, reaching a rate of ten thousand times in an instant.

"This is..." Tie Hun's face revealed a look of shock.

As someone who had seen much and was well-versed in the world, she quickly sensed the change in the Spiritual Domain's time flow speed, and then gazed at Han Li with admiration.

Han Li's previous creation of a hundredfold time difference space had already left Tie Hun astonished, and now this ten thousandfold time difference space left her even more amazed.

"Master is indeed a Heaven-ordained person, and his future prospects are boundless..." Tie Hun thought to herself, and then immediately sat down, cultivating the You Ming Gui Zhou and the San Hun Gui Di.

These two treasures were extremely powerful, especially the San Hun Gui Di, which could easily scatter a cultivator's soul with a single blow.

Unfortunately, neither Tie Hun nor Xi Tang Lao had had the chance to refine the treasures, so they couldn't unleash their full power, or else Xi Tang Lao wouldn't have been defeated so easily.

Han Li didn't know that his actions had made Tie Hun even more devoted to him, and seeing the time difference space reappear, he secretly let out a sigh of relief.

This ten thousandfold time difference space wasn't formed by chance, and as long as he could master it, his cultivation speed could increase by another hundredfold.

However, at this moment, his Spiritual Domain's connection to him was severed, and he had to find a way to safely dispel this time difference space, or else he would have to destroy the Guan Yin Tian Xuan Grand Array every time he wanted to leave.

Han Li closed his eyes, circulating the "Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue" as he sensed the flow of time within the Spiritual Domain.

This time difference space was the result of his Spiritual Domain and the Guan Yin Tian Xuan Grand Array merging, and to dispel this space, he had to find a way to control the Spiritual Domain again.

In reality, he had tried this method before, but at the time, he was anxious and gave up after a few attempts, instead using brute force to break the time difference space.

Now, Han Li had entered this time difference space for the second time, and his state of mind was much calmer, as he carefully sensed the surroundings and operated the Time Laws.

In the blink of an eye, five or six hundred years passed.

Han Li slowly opened his eyes, a hint of joy flashing in his gaze.

After these years of cultivation and contemplation, he had discovered some things he hadn't noticed before.

Firstly, he had basically understood the principle behind the formation of this time difference space.

The formation of this time difference space still relied on the power of the Jun Tian Ri Hu, the Jun Tian Ri Hu had disappeared, but its contained Time Laws' powers and divine abilities hadn't been lost, they had just merged with the Zhen Yan Bao Lun, making the current Zhen Yan Bao Lun equivalent to the Jun Tian Ri Hu.

That's why the Zhen Yan Bao Lun could resonate with the Guan Yin Tian Xuan Grand Array, creating a time difference space.

However, his "Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue" and the Guan Yin Tian Xuan Grand Array had produced a strange effect, amplifying the time acceleration to ten thousand times.
Secondly, there was the issue of the time-space consumption. Originally, the Light of Years Array required the consumption of celestial stones and time law power to activate.

The integration of the Supreme Heavenly Sundial and the True Words Treasure Wheel had made the new time-space the same, except that the time law power was no longer provided by the Years of Time Lamp, which had already merged with the Time Severing Torch.

The time law power of the time-space was now provided by his spiritual domain.

Having successively merged the Years of Time Lamp, the Supreme Heavenly Sundial, and the Two Lives God Tree, Han Li's spiritual domain now contained an immense amount of time law power, more than enough to support the operation of the Light of Years Array.

Moreover, even if the time law power in his spiritual domain was exhausted, as long as he was given some time, he could recover.

Han Li had always been worried about the time law power in the Years of Time Lamp being exhausted, and having to find new time law objects to supply the Light of Years Array.

Now, this problem had been solved, and he no longer had to worry.

However, it was also because of the integration of the Supreme Heavenly Sundial and the Years of Time Lamp into his spiritual domain that the current time-space had certain limitations.

Han Li raised his hand, and the golden sun transformed from the Time Severing Torch flew down, stopping in front of him.

The golden sun's golden flames were rolling, but through the golden flames, one could see over a hundred and eighty time law patterns, except that five or six of them had already dimmed.

The existence of the spiritual domain had its own limitations, and once all the time law patterns had dimmed, the spiritual domain would automatically dissolve. Now that the spiritual domain and the Light of Years Array had formed a time-space, the situation should still be the same.

This meant that Han Li had found a way to dissolve the time-space.

However, this method was too rigid and inflexible, and in case of an emergency, he couldn't respond immediately, so it was not feasible.

He waved his hand, and the golden sun flew out, returning to the sky.

Han Li raised his five fingers, and five golden lights shot out from his fingertips.

The golden lights contained countless golden runes, emitting an incredibly powerful five-element law power.

He muttered to himself, and his hands flew quickly to form a seal. The five golden lights rotated rapidly, transforming into five golden rings, emitting an explosive increase in time law power, before entering the golden moon, the golden sun, the lush forest, the surging river, and the golden sand.

The golden moon, the golden sun, the lush forest, the surging river, and the golden sand glowed simultaneously, and the entire spiritual domain roared to life, impacting the sealing power outside.

The spiritual domain space immediately shook, but that was all, and no matter how hard it tried, the sealing power outside remained unbreakable.

Not far away, Qi Hong, who was meditating with his eyes closed, was startled awake, but seeing Han Li's serious expression, he did not speak, standing quietly beside him.

The entire spiritual domain was like a stormy sea, but the sealing power outside remained firm, unmoving, and the spiritual light around the Light of Years Array flashed violently, as if it was about to collapse.

"It seems that relying solely on brute force is still not enough," Han Li hastily stopped the impact.

If he continued, the sealing power outside would not be broken, and the Light of Years Array would be destroyed first.

Although that would also dissolve the time-space, he was looking for another solution.

Han Li looked around his spiritual domain, frowning, but not discouraged.

After observing for five or six hundred years, he still hadn't discovered the reason for the spiritual domain being sealed, but he had some ideas about how to dissolve this sealing.

Han Li waved his hand, and a golden light flew out, enveloping the celestial stones near the Light of Years Array, before returning. All the celestial stones disappeared, taken away by him.

Han Li then formed a seal with his hands, and the golden light on his body rapidly dimmed, his spiritual energy and time law power completely withdrawing, severing his connection with the spiritual domain.

The spiritual domain was formed using his spiritual energy, and as long as the source was cut off, the spiritual domain should automatically close.

Han Li made this move, and the nearby spiritual domain immediately flashed, as if it was about to close.

He saw this scene, and his heart was filled with joy.

But at this moment, a massive devouring power emerged from the surrounding spiritual domain, and Han Li's hidden spiritual energy was instantly pulled out, re-entering the surrounding spiritual domain.

The flashing spiritual domain immediately stabilized.

Moreover, since the Light of Years Array no longer had celestial stones to supply it, it began to frantically absorb the spiritual energy from the spiritual domain.

Under the dual absorption, Han Li's spiritual energy rapidly decreased.

He narrowed his eyes, allowing his spiritual energy to be drawn out.

Han Li concentrated his mind, holding his breath, wanting to see if the spiritual domain would continue to operate after his spiritual energy was depleted.

He had advanced to the Great Luo Realm, and his spiritual energy was incredibly deep, but under the dual absorption of the spiritual domain and the Light of Years Array, it was still depleted after a small half-day.

However, the absorption of the spiritual domain and the Light of Years Array did not stop, and they continued to crazily extract his spiritual energy.
