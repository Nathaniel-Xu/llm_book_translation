In the depths of the Yellow Springs, within the Gray White Stone Temple.

The Master of the Cycle of Rebirth pinched his fingers, urging the six-pointed wheel to spin rapidly, and a red light shot out from the center of the wheel, touching Nangong Wan's body and suddenly expanding, transforming into a red light screen that enveloped her.

Nangong Wan's entire body had already flown out of the water pool, suspended in mid-air, emitting a layer of dreamy white light all over her body, and the red light screen surrounding her seemed to be flashing with countless light shadows, as if they were memories.

If Han Li were here, he would certainly recognize that the memories were from Nangong Wan's past experiences, and occasionally, his own figure would appear.

The Master of the Cycle of Rebirth scanned the scene with his eyes, raised his hand, pinched his fingers, and another dark red light shot out from his hand, entering the center of the six-pointed wheel.

The symbols on the wheel's surface lit up, bursting with crystal light, and at the same time, the surface of the wheel flashed with black light, revealing six black circular holes.

The holes were pitch black, bottomless, and seemed to be connected to some mysterious place.

The Master of the Cycle of Rebirth waved his other hand, and a dark red light shot out, transforming into a dark red large hand, reaching into one of the black holes.

A moment later, the dark red hand flew back, holding a cloud-like bundle of colorful light, which also contained countless flashing memories.

The Master of the Cycle of Rebirth's calm eyes flashed with a hint of joy, and with a flip of his hand, he merged the colorful light into Nangong Wan's body.

Nangong Wan's body shook violently, and a new orange-red dreamy light appeared around her.

Two dreamy lights surrounded her body, spinning rapidly, and the Master of the Cycle of Rebirth pinched his fingers, urging the six-pointed wheel to assist the orange-red light, trying to suppress the original white light.

However, the white light was exceptionally resilient, and although it was suppressed, it did not thoroughly subside, firmly occupying its domain.

Nangong Wan's eyes were tightly closed, and her eyebrows were furrowed, as if she was enduring some unknown pain.

Jiaosan stood beside her, his face tense with anxiety.

The Master of the Cycle of Rebirth's eyebrows furrowed, and his hand paused.

"How is it, Master?" Jiaosan asked, noticing the Master's emotions.

"Your mother's physique this life is very compatible with the Cycle of Rebirth, making her memories very stubborn, exceeding my expectations, and difficult to suppress. Forcing the spell... I fear it may harm her body." The Master of the Cycle of Rebirth said.

"Don't force the spell, is there another way?" Jiaosan asked urgently.

The Master of the Cycle of Rebirth was about to speak when his eyebrows suddenly furrowed, and he looked outside.

At that moment, shouts and loud crashes came from outside.

"What's going on? Could it be that someone has invaded the Yellow Springs Island?" Jiaosan exclaimed.

"It's Gu Huang, that old thing, who pretended to surrender but still had his eyes on the Six Paths Wheel. He's come to attack, taking advantage of my current situation... Ah, he's also come, how convenient." The Master of the Cycle of Rebirth's voice was calm, and he chuckled.

"Who is it?" Jiaosan asked.

The Master of the Cycle of Rebirth waved his hand, not answering Jiaosan's question.

"Master, due to the opposing winds, the main forces of the various tribes have already retreated, and there are not many people left on the Yellow Springs Island." Jiaosan frowned.

"No matter, I have already made arrangements. It's a good opportunity to clean up the internal affairs. Unfortunately, the number of people who have come is less than expected... You use this Cycle of Rebirth token to urge the external Cycle of Rebirth array to block Gu Huang first, and I will be able to finish the spell." The Master of the Cycle of Rebirth waved his hand, and a dazzling dark red light shot out, landing in front of Jiaosan.

The light contained a strange token with six points, similar to the six-pointed wheel, with countless star-like patterns flashing on its surface, emitting a million dark red auras.

"Yes." Jiaosan took the token and immediately flew out.

"So many years have passed, and I wonder how many people in the immortal realm know of my existence, but not my name." The Master of the Cycle of Rebirth watched Jiaosan leave, murmuring to himself.

...

On the island, Han Li and the others followed Gu Huang's group, landing near the Gray White Stone Temple, and looking at the dark red light surrounding the temple, their faces changed.

This dark red light contained an extremely powerful force of the Cycle of Rebirth, and for some reason, it gave Han Li a very familiar feeling.

"The Cycle of Rebirth array? That guy should be occupied, and no one is in charge, so it's not worth mentioning." Gu Huang looked at the dark red light surrounding the temple, sneering.

He raised his hand, and the entire sky was filled with a white bone-like aura, emitting an endless pressure.

A deafening crash, and the sky was torn apart, revealing a massive white bone claw that descended from the sky, grasping the dark red light surrounding the temple.

The claw's power was more than ten times stronger than before, and although it was grabbing the light, the entire island was affected, sinking into the Yellow Springs.

The dark red light surrounding the temple fluctuated violently, barely resisting the claw, but quickly becoming thinner, on the verge of being torn apart.

At that moment, a loud shout came from inside the temple, followed by a blinding dark red light that shot out and merged with the surrounding light.

The light's power surged, and the claw's attack was momentarily repelled.
The dark red glow enveloped the area, like a massive tonic, instantly restoring its original thickness and growing even more.

At the same time, a bright light burst forth from the Yellow Springs, a layer of dark red light emanating from it, illuminating the entire Yellow Springs in a vibrant red hue.

Not only that, the dark red light shot straight up into the sky, colliding with the bone-white light of the heavens.

The two massive forces clashed, the whirlwind above the Yellow Springs was easily swept away like fallen leaves, the surrounding void shattered, and countless void rifts burst forth, the surrounding heaven and earth suddenly presenting a scene of great destruction.

A massive devouring force emerged from the shattered void, attempting to consume everything in its surroundings.

Han Li and the others saw this scene, and the five of them immediately gathered together, their protective treasures' light merging into a single entity, defending against the void rifts and spatial fissures.

Xue Li and the others also gathered together around Bone Emperor.

Gui Wu hesitated for a moment, transforming into a black shadow that flew out from Han Li's side, landing near Bone Emperor.

Han Li's eyes flickered, but he didn't stop Gui Wu from leaving.

The Yellow Springs below seemed to be suspended in mid-air, unaffected by the shattered space, due to the Wheel of Rebirth's restrictive aura.

At this moment, a slightly petite figure flew out of the great hall, hovering above it.

Han Li's heart stirred, recognizing the figure as Jiao San.

Jiao San also noticed Han Li and the others, her face flashing with surprise, as if she had realized something.

However, the situation was urgent, and she quickly looked away, muttering to herself, her hands weaving intricate patterns.

A dazzling dark red light spread out from her body, forming a dark red six-pointed circular shadow.

The dark red light within the Yellow Springs began to change, transforming into a massive six-pointed circular wheel that enveloped the entire area, rapidly rotating.

The center of the wheel was the gray-white Stone Hall.

The dark red glow surrounding the Stone Hall also changed, a hundred-zhang-sized dark red magic array appearing on its surface, with countless tiny dark red runes jumping within.

A deafening boom shook the air, a massive dark red light pillar bursting forth from the magic array, piercing the sky.

The light pillar contained billions of dark red runes, radiating an aura of immense power, yet also sharp and unparalleled, as if capable of piercing the heavens.

All of this seemed complex, but it was merely a matter of an instant.

Another thunderous boom shook the air, the White Bone Giant Claw was sent flying.

Bone Emperor himself stumbled backward, his massive body trembling.

Xue Li and the others, standing near Bone Emperor, were also affected by the dark red light pillar, sent flying like leaves in a storm.

The four Da Luo initial-stage cultivators under Bone Emperor's command were caught off guard, their bodies exploding into a bloody mist before they could even cry out.

Xue Li, the Black-Faced Giant, and the Black-Robed Specter were able to retreat in time, narrowly avoiding disaster.

Gui Wu, being a mere remnant soul, should have been the weakest, but she somehow managed to avoid the attack, using an unknown divine technique to evade the danger.

As for Han Li and the others, they were originally standing at a safe distance, and Han Li had led them to retreat further just before the dark red light pillar appeared, so they were unscathed.

"Master, isn't that Jiao San? How did she end up here? Isn't this the domain of the Zhuan Lun Wang?" Ti Hu asked Han Li through transmission.

"Perhaps...this Zhuan Lun Wang is connected to the Wheel of Rebirth?" Jin Tong speculated.

"Let's not reveal our relationship with Jiao San for now, and observe the situation," Han Li transmitted.

Ti Hu and Jin Tong nodded in agreement.

Han Li then transmitted to Shi Chuan Kong and Zi Ling, instructing them not to act rashly, and they naturally didn't object.

However, Shi Chuan Kong's face looked somewhat troubled.

Earlier, when Han Li had released him and Zi Ling from the spatial seal, he had only just learned that many people were vying for the Six Paths Wheel of Rebirth, and he had been forced to join Bone Emperor's team.

As a result, the opportunity to borrow the treasure had greatly decreased, and he seemed to have been drawn into a mysterious conflict.

Zi Ling, on the other hand, reacted with remarkable calmness, as if she had long been accustomed to such extraordinary circumstances, and merely trusted Han Li's decisions.

"If we encounter any trouble later, you can still enter the Flower Branch Space," Han Li said, noticing Shi Chuan Kong's unease.

Han Li's gaze then shifted, looking back at the Stone Hall below.

Jiao San's display of the Wheel of Rebirth's power was earth-shaking, and had even forced Bone Emperor to retreat.

The Wheel of Rebirth's restrictive aura surrounding the Stone Hall was no ordinary thing, and was likely set up by the rumored master of the Wheel of Rebirth.

Combining Gui Wu's words, the true identity of the Zhuan Lun Wang occupying this land was about to be revealed, and it was likely that the master of the Wheel of Rebirth was hiding within the Stone Hall.

And Jiao San, who had boldly faced Bone Emperor alone, showed no signs of fear, as if the master of the Wheel of Rebirth was indeed within the hall.
