Su Su, forming alliances with various clans and developing our own clan is not wrong, but your safety is more important. You now bear the heavy responsibility of the Qing Huo Clan, and with your mother's current state, you must not take any risks," said the woman in blue, looking at Ye Su Su with a gentle sigh.

"No, mother, you will definitely recover!" Ye Su Su suddenly exclaimed.

"I will definitely recover, don't worry," the woman in blue hastily added, regretting her momentary lapse into pessimism.

Ye Su Su's head lowered slightly, her eyes flashing with determination. Her hands suddenly shot out, pointing at the woman in blue's forehead, and a brilliant white light burst forth from her fingertips.

"You...!" the woman in blue's eyes widened, but her pupils quickly became unfocused, and she fell into a deep sleep.

"Master, what are you doing?" the woman in white beside her exclaimed.

Ye Su Su didn't respond, instead taking out a crimson brush and beginning to draw intricate patterns on the ground around the jade bed. She then retrieved various materials and placed them within the patterns.

The woman in white opened her mouth to ask something, but seeing Ye Su Su's intense focus, she bit back her words.

Time passed, and half a day went by, with the sky outside gradually lightening to a pale blue.

Ye Su Su finally stopped, having completed a complex blood-red array around the jade bed.

"Master, what array is this?" the woman in white asked, seemingly unfamiliar with the array.

"The Hua Xue Gui Yuan Array!" Ye Su Su replied calmly.

"What! The Hua Xue Gui Yuan Array is a heaven-defying technique that strips away one's bloodline power and transfers it to another person. You want to use your Qing Huo bloodline power to aid our clan leader, but this is too reckless! The array will cause immense harm to your body, and once your bloodline power is stripped away, it can never be restored. You will ruin your own cultivation, and even be reduced to your original form," the woman in white warned.

"As long as I can save mother, I don't care," Ye Su Su said, her expression serene, with a hint of a gentle smile.

Han Li, watching from the shadows, saw Ye Su Su's expression and furrowed his brow, clearly moved.

"If that's the case, let me do it instead. My cultivation is far superior to yours, and the chances of success are greater," the woman in white suggested.

"No, Elder Qiu, your cultivation may be higher, but when it comes to the purity of the Qing Huo bloodline, I am more suitable. Moreover, Elder Qiu, you don't know that the closer the bloodline relationship between the two individuals, the higher the chances of success," Ye Su Su said firmly.

The woman in white was taken aback.

"Our clan leader's poisoning is extremely severe, and even with this technique, the chances of saving her are only 50%. If we fail, both of us will die here. Elder Qiu, you are the only intact Golden Immortal of our clan, and mother just said that my safety is important. In reality, your safety is more crucial. If you are safe, even if I and mother fall, our clan will still have a glimmer of hope. But if you were to fall, our clan would be doomed," Ye Su Su continued.

The woman in white stood silently, her expression unreadable.

"So, please leave this to me. If I and mother were to fall, our clan's future would be in your hands," Ye Su Su said, bowing her head slightly.

The woman in white remained silent, unsure of what to say.

Ye Su Su stepped forward, her eyes fixed on the blood-red array.

Just as she was about to enter the array, the woman in white grasped her wrist.

"Master...!" Ye Su Su turned to her.

"Elder Qiu, you just said that as leaders of the Qing Huo Clan, we should put the clan's interests above our personal feelings. You have exceptional talent, and your Qing Huo bloodline is extremely pure. Even I and our clan leader are inferior to you in this regard. Our clan's future is limitless with you. But if you use the Hua Xue Gui Yuan Array, you risk ruining your own cultivation. I know this sounds cruel, but if we consider the clan's interests, it's better for you not to take this risk," the woman in white said, her eyes filled with a mix of pain and pleading.

"No, my actions are not driven by personal feelings, but by the clan's interests. I may have some talent, but I'm still only a Mid-True Immortal. Who knows if I'll be able to reach the Golden Immortal stage in the future? If I can save mother, even with only a 50% chance, it's a worthwhile risk," Ye Su Su said, her expression calm and resolute.

The woman in white's eyes widened in alarm, but she couldn't think of anything else to say.

"Besides, it was because of me that mother was injured by the thieves from the Tian Shui Sect. Even you, Elder Qiu, were almost implicated. If I don't do something to help her, I'll live with guilt and regret for the rest of my life. That would affect my cultivation, and I might not even be able to reach the Late True Immortal stage," Ye Su Su said, her voice soft but firm.

The woman in white knew that Ye Su Su's mind was made up and wouldn't be swayed. She could only sigh and step back.

"I'll leave the future to you, Elder Qiu," Ye Su Su said, smiling faintly, before entering the blood-red array.

She sat down at the woman in blue's head, her hands forming a peculiar hand seal, and began to chant a mysterious incantation.

The stone room was filled with a sudden, earsplitting whine, and the blood-red array around the jade bed erupted in a brilliant light, as if it had come to life.

A powerful surge of energy burst forth from the array, expanding outward in all directions.

The woman in white's expression changed, and she quickly formed a hand seal, pointing at the stone room's walls.

The room's seals accelerated, and countless starlight patterns emerged, blocking the array's energy from escaping.

However, the blood-red array's energy was too intense, and some of it still managed to seep out.

The woman in white didn't have time to worry about that, her attention fixed on the two individuals within the array.

Just then, the blood-red array began to change.

A series of sharp, piercing whines echoed through the room, and countless blood-red threads erupted from the array, wrapping around Ye Su Su and entering her body.

Han Li, watching from the shadows, saw this and raised an eyebrow, his eyes filled with surprise.

Ye Su Su's body glowed with a bright, emerald light, her brows furrowed in pain, but she suppressed it, continuing to chant the incantation.
The blood array's radiance intensified, and more blood-colored threads emerged, pouring into Ye Susu's body.

Ye Susu's body emitted a bright blue glow, and her skin flashed with a blue light, revealing a network of blue veins that seemed to traverse her entire body, shining with a fierce blood pulse.

At the same time, a blue fox phantom appeared behind her, exuding an aura of nobility and majesty, but with only two tails.

Ye Susu's hand suddenly extended, pressing against the brow of the blue-robed woman.

Innumerable blood-colored threads shot out from her palm, entering the woman's brow.

The blood-colored threads contained a faint blue pattern, which flowed into the woman's body.

The blue-robed woman's skin flashed with a blue light, revealing a network of blue veins, albeit less vibrant than Ye Susu's.

As Ye Susu's palm continued to inject the blood-colored threads, the woman's blue veins gradually brightened.

Ye Susu's own blue veins, however, began to fade, and her face rapidly turned pale. The blue fox phantom behind her also grew thinner.

But her eyes still shone with a hint of joy, and she pointed with her other hand.

A blue light shot out from her finger, entering the woman's lower abdomen.

A loud "boom" echoed, and the woman's body suddenly radiated a dazzling blue light, like the sun.

The blue light quickly receded, and a layer of blue flames enveloped her upper body, spreading towards her frozen lower half.

The blue flames clashed with the icy blue crystals, emitting a hissing sound, before slowly melting and disappearing.

The white-robed woman's tense face relaxed slightly as she watched.

In the distance, Han Li's eyes flashed with a purple glow, gazing at the icy blue crystals, before shaking his head.

The blue flames continued to advance, and the icy blue crystals rapidly melted, retreating from the woman's waist to her calves.

The woman's lower legs turned a deep blue, resembling two blue crystal shards, with a blue light pulsating within.

However, the icy blue crystals' melting slowed, and they began to resist the blue flames' assault.

Ye Susu's blue veins had faded significantly, and the blue fox phantom behind her had almost disappeared.

She gazed at the woman's blue lower legs, her eyes narrowing, and her voice low and urgent. The blood array beneath her flashed again, and a surge of blood energy flooded her body.

Ye Susu's blue veins flashed once more, before disappearing, coalescing into a blue light that merged with the woman's body.

The woman's blue flames surged, fiercely attacking the icy blue crystals, but ultimately failing to eradicate them.

Instead, the woman's blue light within her legs suddenly intensified, launching a counterattack that forced the blue flames to retreat.

A blast of icy energy erupted, and the icy blue crystals rapidly reformed, re-freezing the woman's body.

The stone chamber's temperature plummeted, and the walls creaked with a "crackling" sound, as a layer of ice crystals formed.

The blood array on the ground was also frozen, and Ye Susu's body was trapped within.

Her face turned deathly pale, and she stumbled, her eyes wide with terror, yet unable to act.

The white-robed woman's face changed, and she released the seal on the stone chamber's restriction, rushing towards Ye Susu.

Ye Susu turned to face her, and their eyes met.

The white-robed woman's face turned pale, and she froze, halting her approach.

The blue-robed woman on the bed stirred, awakened by the cold energy.

She assessed the situation, and her voice rose in a gentle shout. The blue flames on her body briefly intensified, temporarily repelling the blue light's invasion.

"Qiu Long, quickly take Susu away..." the blue-robed woman cried out.

But before she could finish, the blue light surged again, its radiance illuminating a multitude of blue runes, coalescing into a blue flame that shattered the blue-robed woman's defenses.

The icy blue crystals spread rapidly, reaching the woman's chest, on the verge of completely freezing her.

Ye Susu's body was also frozen, her lower half encased in ice.

The white-robed woman watched, her eyes struggling, before gritting her teeth and summoning a burst of blue energy, ready to charge forward.

Just then, a black figure appeared, blocking her path.

It was none other than Han Li.
