Han Li and the other two were currently walking through a dimly lit corridor, with Qu Lin leading the way. The golden light on her forehead was flashing, and she was constantly sensing the location of the Jin Tong.

The corridor soon came to an end, and a massive stone chamber appeared before them. The chamber was enormous, with an area of several thousand meters, and it was not empty. A series of black stone pillars, each as thick as a dozen people could hug, stood upright on either side of the chamber.

The stone pillars were crystal clear, as if they had been cast from a type of crystal jade. They were engraved with strange patterns that resembled ghostly symbols, which seemed to be a type of array or text.

The stone pillars lined up on either side, leaving a narrow passageway of about ten meters in the middle that led to the depths of the chamber.

The lighting in the chamber was dim, and only a faint outline of a closed blue door could be seen in the distance.

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise as he gazed at the scene before him. He did not dare to enter rashly and instead asked Luan Yan, "Luan Dao friend, do you know what this place is?"

"I don't know," Luan Yan replied with a shake of her head.

"Look at the patterns on the stone pillars, they seem to be the legendary You Ming text," Qu Lin said carefully as she examined the patterns.

"You Ming text?" Han Li's eyebrows furrowed.

"The so-called You Ming text is said to be the writing of the Nine You Ming Realm," Qu Lin explained. "I only saw it in an ancient book a long time ago."

"Nine You Ming Realm?" Han Li's eyes sparkled. "Does such a place really exist?"

"Yes, it's said to be the place where all things in the world undergo reincarnation," Qu Lin said. "However, very few people can go there, so it's gradually become a legend."

"Qu Dao friend, can you understand the You Ming text?" Han Li asked, his eyes narrowing.

Qu Lin shook her head, "I only know that such a text exists, but I don't understand it. However, these stone pillars seem to be seal pillars, and I'm afraid they might be sealing something inside. As long as we don't touch them, we should be fine."

Han Li nodded, thinking the same thing.

However, he couldn't determine if it was safe to proceed.

As he pondered, he closed his eyes and activated his Divine Devil's Eye, even venturing out with his divine sense to probe the stone pillars. However, he still couldn't sense anything.

"Qu Dao friend, are you certain that the Jin Tong is up ahead?" Han Li asked after a moment of contemplation.

Qu Lin nodded, "Not far now. But with the appearance of the You Ming text, I feel a sense of eeriness... I'm not sure if we should proceed, or if we should turn back."

Han Li thought for a moment before saying, "Since we've come this far, we can't turn back now. However, this place is unusual, so I'll take the lead, Qu Lin will follow behind me, and Luan Yan will bring up the rear."

Luan Yan nodded in agreement.

Han Li continued, "With me leading the way, we should be fine. Qu Lin, you're an expert in the Jin Tong, but I'm afraid that aside from your physical body, your cultivation and methods are no match for mine. If we encounter any trouble, I'm afraid you won't be able to handle it."

Qu Lin smiled and said, "With you leading the way, I feel much more at ease. Let's proceed, and we'll be careful."

Luan Yan smiled faintly and winked at Han Li, who smiled back and took the lead, entering the chamber.

Qu Lin followed closely behind, and Luan Yan brought up the rear.

Their footsteps echoed through the chamber, and they walked for a short distance without encountering any issues.

Han Li remained vigilant, his eyes scanning the surroundings.

As they reached the center of the chamber, a faint rustling sound came from the stone pillars on either side.

The sound was soft, but Han Li and the others were highly attuned, and they immediately sensed it.

"Be careful, something's happening!" Han Li shouted, his body glowing with golden light as he protected himself.

At that moment, the stone pillars began to glow with a faint black light, and dark shadows began to writhe and twist on their surfaces.

Han Li's eyes widened as he swiftly activated his movement technique, dashing forward.

Luan Yan quickly followed, but Qu Lin retreated, shooting back the way they came.

Han Li's eyes narrowed as he watched Qu Lin, his body glowing with golden light as if preparing to make a move.

However, the black shadows on the stone pillars suddenly flared up, and a barrage of black lights shot out, akin to a hail of arrows, covering Han Li and the others.

The black lights emitted a mournful howl, echoing through the chamber and causing the trio's souls to tremble.

Han Li couldn't worry about Qu Lin anymore and quickly activated his Soul Refining Technique to stabilize his soul. At the same time, golden lightning bolts began to flash on his body.
With a single wave of his hand, the lightning bolts transformed into golden lightning whips, which shot out in all directions and collided with the black lights.

The power of the lightning within the Qingtong Bee Cloud Sword had advanced to the level of the Doutu Shenlei, greatly increasing its might. The golden lightning flashed, and the surrounding air seemed to be scorched by a faint, burning heat.

The black lights and golden lightning whips shattered into pieces upon collision.

Lan Yan waved his hand, releasing a dozen blue flying knives that danced around him, forming a intricate knife array that blocked the incoming black lights.

The knife array's power was considerable, and although it was shaken by the black lights, it managed to hold its ground.

Qu Lin's skin turned a pure gold color, and he didn't resist the black lights, allowing them to strike him. His body continued to shoot backward like lightning.

The black lights struck him, producing a series of loud "bangs," but they didn't cause much harm, only leaving behind shallow marks.

Qu Lin blinked and flew out of the black light's range, landing at the entrance of the stone room. His hands suddenly shone with golden light, and he swung them forward.

Two golden lights shot out from his palms, striking the stone room's wall with a loud "bang."

The wall's surface had two shallow protrusions, which were crushed by the golden lights.

The black lights emanating from the stone pillars suddenly brightened by over ten times, but they no longer targeted Han Li and Lan Yan. Instead, they changed direction and shot into the ground, merging with it.

A low "hum" sound filled the air.

In an instant, the ground's surface revealed a layer of dense black light, and a series of dark, ink-like characters emerged, swirling and intertwining to form a massive, blurry pattern. It seemed to be some sort of mysterious formation, emitting a chilling, bone-piercing cold.

Han Li felt his body tense, and he fell to the ground.

At the same time, the black formation on the ground released countless black threads, enveloping his body.

Han Li's limbs felt as if they were bound by invisible steel, and he couldn't move. His internal energy was also frozen.

Lan Yan was even more affected, falling to the ground before Han Li, unable to move or struggle.

"Qu Lin, what's the meaning of this?" Han Li asked in a deep voice.

Although he had never truly trusted Qu Lin, he hadn't expected him to be so familiar with this place, even understanding how to control the local restrictions. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been trapped so easily.

Earlier, Qu Lin had pretended to exchange a large quantity of Spiritual Stone for their help in finding the Golden Boy, which was clearly a ruse. Qu Lin had intentionally led them to this place.

"Many thanks, Han Daoist, for bringing me into the Jiuyuan Temple and leading me to the vicinity of the Golden Boy," Qu Lin said with a smug smile.

"Your goal is also to obtain the Golden Boy? Did you come here before?" Han Li asked.

"Now that things have come to this, why bother asking questions you already know the answer to?" Qu Lin's face revealed a cold, icy smile.

"The Golden Boy's devouring of my clone... Han Li's mind stirred.

Could it be that the Golden Boy that Jin Tong had devoured earlier was related to Qu Lin?

"Enough idle chatter. If we don't leave now, the Ghost Spirit Child will arrive soon. You two can stay here and wait," Qu Lin said, turning to leave.

Just then, a loud "boom" echoed, and the stone door at the back of the room burst open.

The darkness within the room condensed, and a massive black shadow shot out, enveloping Han Li and the others.

Han Li and Lan Yan were already trapped on the ground, and the black shadow's immense power made them unable to move at all. Lan Yan even fell to the ground.

"Damn it! You came so quickly!" Qu Lin's face revealed a furious expression, and his hands began to rub together.

A piercing, ear-piercing whine filled the air as countless sword-like crystal lights burst forth from Qu Lin's body. They condensed into a majestic golden sword shadow, which slashed toward the black shadow.

A "slash" sound echoed as the black shadow's fearsome aura was torn apart.

Qu Lin's face revealed a hint of joy, and he transformed into a golden light, flying toward the entrance.

"You! You betrayed the Jiuyuan Temple and escaped, and now you dare to return? You won't be leaving again!" a shrill voice echoed from the air.

A massive, house-sized black claw appeared before Qu Lin's golden light, grasping downward.

The claw's surface was covered in scales, and its five massive fingers were adorned with strange symbols and patterns, emitting an aura of immense power. The air seemed to be torn apart by the claw's passage.

A "crack" sound echoed as Qu Lin's golden light burst apart, and his body was torn into five or six pieces.

However, the pieces of his body flashed with golden light, transforming into six golden beetle-like creatures that continued to shoot forward, disappearing into the entrance.

The black shadow in the air condensed, taking the form of a young man in black robes with a gaunt face and cold, piercing eyes. He revealed a look of surprise.

"Ghost Spirit Child!" Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he whispered a single word.
