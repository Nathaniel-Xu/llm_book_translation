Han Li, it seems your identity is not simple at all! Back then, we parted ways, and you said you wouldn't come to our Savage Wilderness Domain, but who would have thought that you'd end up here after all?

Han Li smiled and bowed, saying, "I left you the Feather Scale back then, thinking that one day you'd come to the Savage Wilderness and would need it. Now it seems that my intuition was correct, and you, Han Li, have a connection with us."

Li Qi Ma also laughed heartily, saying, "Speaking of the Feather Scale, it seems it's not very useful after all. I just took it out, and someone accused me of being a fake, almost becoming a shameless swindler, and was attacked by everyone."

Han Li's gaze shifted, and he glanced at Qing Dian, saying with a hint of meaning, "I think there must be some misunderstanding in this matter. Qing Dian, what do you say?"

Qing Dian, covering his broken fang, hastily replied, "Young Master's words are correct, it was all... all a misunderstanding."

Li Qi Ma smiled and said, "If it's a misunderstanding, then it's settled now. You should go retrieve your broken tooth, and your clan's elder should have a way to fix it."

Qing Dian's eyes flashed with a hint of resentment, but he nodded and said, "Yes."

He then turned and went to the city wall, pulled out his broken tooth, and left.

Li Qi Ma turned his gaze back to Han Li and said, "You didn't respond to our invitation back then, but today you came voluntarily. I suppose you have some business to attend to? If there's anything we can help with, please don't hesitate to speak."

Han Li hesitated for a moment before telling Li Qi Ma about Xiao Bai's situation.

Li Qi Ma's expression changed, and he exclaimed, "He actually possesses the bloodline of the Ink Eye Pixiu... If that's true, then saving him wouldn't be a favor you owe us, but rather a great debt we owe you!"

Han Li's gaze condensed, and he said seriously, "Xiao Bai and I have a special relationship. As long as I can save him, it's all that matters. Talk of debts and favors is trivial."

Li Qi Ma thought for a moment before saying, "Very well... Since that's the case, Han Li, you'll come with me to the city immediately. I'll take you to meet the True Spirit King on the Bahuang Mountain."

Han Li, however, seemed hesitant.

"What's wrong, Han Li? Do you have some concerns?" Li Qi Ma asked.

"Meeting the True Spirit King is no trivial matter. I've come in a hurry, and today I've caused a big commotion at the town gate. I'm a bit flustered. How about we do it another day?" Han Li said with a smile, his tone ambiguous.

Li Qi Ma understood Han Li's intention and said, "That's fine. You can come with me to my estate first, and when you're ready, I'll take you to meet the True Spirit King."

Just then, Liu Le'er spoke up, "Young Master, my brother and I have also been reunited for a long time. I've already invited him to our Tianhu Clan."

Li Qi Ma looked at Han Li with surprise, saying, "You're acquainted with the Tianhu Clan's young fairy, Liu Le'er? You're indeed a lucky man..."

Han Li tried to explain, but Li Qi Ma cut him off, giving him a knowing glance.

Han Li looked at Li Qi Ma with a hint of frustration, while Liu Le'er simply covered her mouth and smiled.

"By the way, the Silver Horned Rhinoceros and Cloud Patterned Tiger tribes, although they're small and remote, were the first to discover Xiao Bai and escorted us here. They've earned their merits and hardships..." Han Li said, pointing to the carriages behind him.

Li Qi Ma smiled and said, "Don't worry, I'll take care of them. They'll receive preferential treatment in the future, including territory and resources."

Han Li nodded and said, "Thank you."

He then went to instruct San Tu and the others to follow Li Qi Ma.

After the initial ups and downs, the situation had taken a turn for the better. San Tu knew that their two tribes would soon rise to prominence, and they were even more grateful to Han Li. Despite their injuries, they insisted on getting up to pay their respects.

As they parted ways, Han Li handed Li Qi Ma the Feather Scale, saying, "This belongs to you."

Li Qi Ma smiled and said, "You keep it. I'll announce that it was a gift from me, and from now on, there won't be any more unpleasantness like today."

Han Li thought for a moment before deciding not to refuse and put the Feather Scale away.

After they left, Han Li and Liu Le'er walked into the city, surrounded by the admiring gazes of the crowd.

"Brother, why did you have me speak up earlier? You're acquainted with Young Master Li Qi Ma, so why did you refuse his kindness?" Liu Le'er asked, walking beside Han Li.

Han Li smiled and said, "It's nothing. I just didn't want to trouble him."

Liu Le'er looked at Han Li with curiosity, but didn't press the matter further.
I've translated the chapter into English, following the specified guidelines. Here is the translated text:

I'm not familiar with him, and his identity is special, so I'm a bit suspicious of his intentions when he gave me the Feathered Scales back then. I couldn't completely trust him. Han Li shook his head and said.

There were some things he didn't say, and he was also a bit uneasy about the True Spirit King. He planned to investigate the situation after arriving at the Tian Huo Tribe and then decide whether to meet with him.

"Brother, how did you get to know the Young Master?" Liu Le'er asked again.

"This is a long story... By the way, why do you call him the Young Master?" Han Li asked back.

"He's the descendant of the True Spirit King Bai Ze, so he's naturally our Young Master. It's said that he wandered outside for a long time, and it was only around a hundred years ago that he returned to the wilderness. But as soon as he returned, he was highly respected, and even the Tribe Leader called him Young Master," Liu Le'er explained.

"I see... I really underestimated him before," Han Li nodded and muttered to himself.

"Brother, the Tribe Leader has been intentionally blocking your news, not letting me know. But I always find ways to secretly inquire, and I know you've been traveling through many immortal realms, causing a lot of trouble along the way. I'm both worried and a bit envious..." Liu Le'er smiled slyly and said in a low voice.

"There's nothing to be envious of. Most of the time, I was being pursued and had to escape for my life. It's not a pleasant experience," Han Li furrowed his brow and said.

"Freedom... Staying in the tribe is safe, but it's really boring. Every day is just cultivation and listening to the Tribe Leader's lectures. I miss the days when we adventured together," Liu Le'er said with a hint of melancholy.

"If you can have stability, it's better to have stability... Cultivating immortality is about seeking longevity, not wandering aimlessly and being anxious every day," Han Li said, his expression turning slightly melancholic.

Liu Le'er tilted her head, listening to Han Li's words, and nodded as if she understood.

The two of them continued chatting as they headed towards the Tian Huo Tribe's residence.

The orange-red sunset had already fallen behind the city, and the sky was gradually darkening.

... ...

That night.

Han Li followed Liu Le'er to a location below the Eight Wastes Mountain, where a large, majestic building stood.

The building was made of a bluish-gray material and had a distinct style, with intricate carvings and patterns of spirit beasts everywhere.

At the highest point of the building, a massive white nine-tailed fox statue stood, overlooking the surroundings. The statue emitted a powerful aura that suppressed the True Spirit bloodlines within Han Li.

"Stone Brother, this is our Tian Huo Tribe's residence in the Eight Wastes Mountain. The statue is the sacred image of the Tian Huo Saint Ancestor, containing a hint of the Saint Ancestor's True Spirit bloodline. It will have a suppressing effect on the bloodline powers of other tribes. You can just retract your True Spirit bloodline," Liu Le'er said, noticing Han Li's expression.

Han Li nodded, and with a silent incantation, he activated the Heavenly Execution, Sealing the Prison technique, retracting his True Spirit bloodline and leaving only the power of the Thunderbird. The suppressing effect immediately weakened.

"The Tian Huo Saint Ancestor? Is he called Liu Qi?" Han Li asked, his expression changing.

"How do you know about Liu Qi, Brother? There are hardly any people in the Tian Huo Tribe who know about his existence?" Liu Le'er asked, surprised.

"I just happened to hear someone mention him," Han Li replied, not revealing the truth.

Liu Qi was not the Tian Huo Saint Ancestor, but rather a genius of the Tian Huo Tribe who had the potential to inherit the Saint Ancestor's bloodline and become the new Tian Huo True Spirit King. However, he had also disappeared without a trace, and the Tian Huo Tribe had declined ever since.

Han Li listened to Liu Le'er's words, his expression calm, but his mind racing with thoughts.

He had met Liu Qi in the Gray Realm and had interacted with him several times. He thought he had a good understanding of the Tian Huo Tribe's situation, but now it seemed that he only knew a small part of the story.

"You're telling me this for nothing, Brother. Let's go see the Tribe Leader. You've met him before, and he's very kind to his juniors. He just values seniority and respect, so be polite when you speak to him, and you might gain some opportunities," Liu Le'er said, thinking Han Li was uninterested in the Tian Huo Tribe's affairs.

Han Li's mind stirred, and he recalled the white-robed middle-aged man who had saved him in the wilderness but had also warned him not to contact Liu Le'er again.

Their encounter was not pleasant, but the man had saved him, so he should go pay his respects. Han Li nodded in agreement.
