As soon as Han Li entered the flower branch space, he furrowed his brow, feeling that something was off.

Before he could think further, a loud, thunderous sound shook the air, piercing his heart, and was accompanied by a cacophony of ghostly wails that were ear-piercingly sharp, yet somehow also mournful and low, making one feel irritable.

He felt his mind and body being shaken, and his hands and feet began to move involuntarily. He quickly calmed himself by circulating his Refine the Spirit technique, and then looked towards the source of the sound.

He saw that the ghostly wails were coming from the attic where Ti Xuan was in seclusion.

At this moment, the attic was shrouded in a thick, dark energy that resembled ink, and a black vortex had formed, with ghostly shadows flickering in and out, causing the surrounding restrictions to tremble.

Fortunately, the restrictions were ones that Han Li had personally created, and they had been infused with the power of the Time Laws, or else they would not have been able to withstand the impact of the dark energy.

"What's going on?" Han Li quickly flew over, and released a strand of his divine sense to investigate the restrictions.

But as soon as his divine sense entered the black vortex, it was immediately swallowed up, and a powerful, devouring force emerged from the vortex, attempting to invade his mind.

Han Li quickly withdrew his divine sense, and was able to block the strange, devouring force.

He raised an eyebrow, and a hint of a smile appeared on his face.

The situation before him was clear - it was definitely caused by Ti Xuan's absorption of the Wu Xiang Ghost King's energy, and it seemed that she had made a breakthrough.

However, Han Li's expression soon turned serious, and he realized that he couldn't intervene in this matter. He could only rely on Ti Xuan to get through it on her own, and with her abilities, she should be fine.

He raised his hand, and a few dozen golden lights shot out, landing near the attic, and forming another, thicker layer of golden light.

This layer of restrictions also contained the power of the Time Laws, and it resonated with the inner layer of restrictions, causing the two layers of golden light to stabilize.

The ghostly wails from inside were also blocked, and Han Li was no longer affected by them.

He nodded, and then went to the new attic that had been built near the medicine garden.

The attic was filled with all sorts of materials and treasures that Han Li had collected from the Tai Sui Immortal Mansion, including minerals, spiritual artifacts, and other objects.

Some of the larger spiritual materials were placed outside the attic, piled up in several large heaps, and the spiritual herbs and medicines that had been transplanted from the Tai Sui Immortal Mansion were even more numerous.

Han Li placed Xiao Bai on the top floor of the attic, and set up a protective restriction beside it, before he felt at ease.

He looked at the various treasures inside and outside the attic, and his expression was a mix of excitement and worry.

The treasures he had collected from the Tai Sui Immortal Mansion were truly numerous, and it was a hassle to deal with them. However, if he were to exchange them for immortal stones, he would gain an unprecedented amount.

It was just that since he had left the Tai Sui Immortal Mansion, he had been busy with various matters, and hadn't had the chance to deal with this.

Han Li flipped his hand, and took out a blank jade slip, carefully cataloging the various treasures inside the attic, categorizing and recording them.

After a day of work, he finally finished organizing the treasures inside the attic, and then went outside to organize the spiritual materials and herbs.

After completing this task, Han Li sat down near the attic, and with a flick of his sleeve, a pile of colorful objects appeared in front of him - a collection of storage artifacts.

These storage artifacts were ones that had belonged to the various cultivators who had fallen in the Tai Sui Immortal Mansion, and Han Li had collected them along the way. They were a major gain from this trip.

The most valuable ones were the storage artifacts that had belonged to She Chen and Lan Yuanzi.

Han Li had previously taken a rough look at She Chen's storage artifact, but had only glanced at the treasures inside without examining them closely.

He picked up She Chen's storage artifact, and with a wave of his hand, a large pile of objects appeared on the ground.

Han Li's eyes scanned the objects, and a hint of a smile appeared on his face.

She Chen, the Da Luo realm existence, had not disappointed him - his wealth was immense, and the materials, spiritual artifacts, and other objects were countless. Just the immortal stones alone numbered over two million.

And among them, there were thirty or forty special immortal stones that were even larger than the middle-grade immortal stones, and they emitted a dazzling, fiery light that contained an astonishing amount of immortal energy.

"Are these high-grade immortal stones?" Han Li's eyes lit up, and he picked up one of the immortal stones.

A pure and vast immortal energy emanated from it, and his body felt as if it were soaking in a warm spring, feeling extremely comfortable, and he almost couldn't help but sigh in pleasure.

Han Li smiled, and gazed lovingly at the immortal stone in his hand.

Although he had never seen one before, he could confirm that this immortal stone was indeed a high-grade immortal stone, and the immortal energy it contained was even more concentrated and pure than the energy in his own body.

If he were to use this high-grade immortal stone to restore his immortal energy, it would probably take only a few breaths to fill him up.

However, high-grade immortal stones were extremely rare, and using them to restore immortal energy would be too extravagant.

Han Li had read in the classics that high-grade immortal stones had many uses, such as refining high-grade spiritual artifacts, breaking through realms, and even cutting through the corpse and opening the way to the Dao.

He played with the high-grade immortal stones for a while, and then carefully put them away.
Han Li immediately put away the other spiritual stones and took out the other items, categorizing them. He then took out the storage bag that belonged to Lan Yuanzi.

When he had captured Lan Yuanzi in the Years Tower, he had taken this storage bag.

Han Li inserted his spiritual sense into the bag and took out its contents, categorizing them. Lan Yuanzi's spiritual stones were fewer in number than Shi Chan's, with only six million, and the highest quality was only mid-grade, with no high-grade stones.

He then categorized the other storage bags, which belonged to cultivators with lower cultivation levels and wealth that couldn't compare to Shi Chan and Lan Yuanzi. All the spiritual stones in these bags added up to only four million.

Han Li put all the spiritual stones into his own storage bag, and a faint smile appeared on his face.

He had previously killed people and stolen treasures, accumulating a considerable amount of wealth, and his spiritual stones had been less than ten million. Now, he had increased his wealth by more than three times.

Furthermore, there were still many treasures around him that he hadn't processed, and if he sold them all, his wealth would likely increase by another fold.

Han Li took out the treasures around him and in the attic, selecting the ones he might use, and then took out the mask of the Wheel of Reincarnation, opening the transaction screen and putting the other treasures up for sale.

There were too many treasures around him, and he was busy for over a month, finally selling most of them and obtaining over thirty million spiritual stones.

This was because Han Li was in a hurry to process these items and didn't ask for a high price, otherwise, he would have gotten an even higher price.

The remaining items were some rare and hard-to-sell treasures, which he put up on the Wheel of Reincarnation's transaction platform, waiting for buyers.

After all, he now had over seventy million spiritual stones, which was enough for him to use for a long time.

With this many spiritual stones, Han Li was not only considered wealthy among the Taiyi cultivators, but even among the Daluo cultivators, he was considered a rich man. Even in some small-scale immortal domains, the largest sects might not have as much wealth as he did.

With these spiritual stones as his backing, he had the confidence to offer a reward for the purchase of time law materials, which he had never had before.

Unfortunately, materials containing the power of time law were hard to come by, and even with his spiritual stones, he would have to wait for an opportunity.

Just then, Han Li's eyebrows moved, and he flew out of the flower petal space, arriving at the outside camp.

"Shi Mu, senior," a voice came from outside, without entering the camp.

Santu and Yun Bao were standing outside the camp, each accompanied by over a dozen followers.

Behind them was a bone-colored flying boat, about forty to fifty meters long, but its material was ordinary. Next to the flying boat were two tiger-like demonic beasts with wings on their backs, which seemed to be used for pulling the boat.

Behind the flying boat were several small flying boats and flying cars, also pulled by the tiger-like demonic beasts, carrying some goods. It was unclear whether Santu and Yun Bao were planning to take these goods to the Eight Wastes Mountain to sell.

"Come in," Han Li said, his face expressionless, knowing that it was time to leave.

"Shi Mu, senior, we've made all the preparations. When do you think we should leave?" Santu asked respectfully.

"Let's leave immediately," Han Li said.

"Yes," Santu and Yun Bao replied in unison.

Han Li walked out of the camp and was led by Santu and Yun Bao onto the flying boat, where they arranged the best room for him.

The flying boat then lifted off, pulled by the two tiger-like demonic beasts, and flew forward.

Although the two beasts were only at the Golden Immortal level, they seemed to be naturally gifted, and their flying speed was extremely fast, not inferior to some Taiyi cultivators.

Han Li watched this scene, and although he had better flying boats that could speed up the process, he didn't want to reveal his identity, so he didn't intervene.

"I'll be closing up in here, so don't disturb me unless something important comes up," he instructed Santu and Yun Bao.

"Yes," they replied hastily, and then quickly retreated.

Han Li was pleased with their obedience, and then he set up restrictions in the room, before opening the flower petal space entrance again and flying inside, sitting down in the three-story attic.

The things he had sold previously, although valuable, didn't mean much to him.

The greatest gain from his previous trip to the Years Tower was not those treasures.

Han Li sat silently for a moment, then flipped his hand, and four items appeared beside him.

The first item was a golden book, rolled up and tied with a golden thread, which was the book that had been placed with the Years Tower lamp.

The second item was a purple jade slip, which was the "Five Thunders True Law Scripture" given to him by the Black Sky Demon Ancestor.

The third item was a golden ancient lamp, which was the Years Tower lamp, and the fourth item was the Heavenly Sword Array diagram.

These four items, along with the white fire pearl from the Phoenix Bird, were the greatest gains from his trip to the Years Tower.

Han Li put the Years Tower lamp and the other items aside, first taking out the golden book.

He had already roughly studied the other three items, but he hadn't opened this book, and he didn't know what it was.

However, since this book was placed with the Years Tower lamp, it was definitely not an ordinary book.
