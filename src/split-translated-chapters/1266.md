Han Li exhaled a breath of air, sat cross-legged, and began to cultivate in silence.

The void outside was extremely dangerous, but the heavenly and earthly energies here were extremely dense, making it suitable for cultivation.

Meanwhile, Xiao Bai continued to manipulate the white cloth bag, enthusiastically collecting nearby mineral materials.

The giant bird carried Han Li and Xiao Bai forward, and in the blink of an eye, more than half an hour had passed.

At this moment, the sky in front of them darkened, as if night had suddenly fallen.

Han Li, who was cultivating, sensed something and opened his eyes, looking forward with a raised eyebrow.

The sudden darkness in front of them was not due to the void outside having day and night changes, but because a massive black cloud had suddenly appeared, rolling in like a tide.

The black cloud churned and rolled, with various shadows flickering inside, giving off an eerie feeling.

"What is this?" Xiao Bai also noticed the anomaly in front of them, stopped collecting mineral materials, and looked forward with a shocked expression.

"This is the Tianmo Cloud, a condensed entity of the Tianmo from outside the realm, it has a shape but no substance, and cannot be destroyed, making it the greatest danger in the void space, you two be careful, especially you, Han Xiao," the giant bird's voice came from above.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat, but before he could say anything, the giant bird had already charged into the black cloud.

He felt a chill, as if he had been submerged in cold water, and the surroundings were pitch black, with the giant bird and Xiao Bai beside him barely visible.

Han Li didn't have time to think, and quickly activated the Time Law to protect himself.

At this moment, an invisible wave of energy surged out from the darkness, enveloping him.

Before Han Li could react, the surroundings changed, and he found himself in a gray, misty space, with the giant bird and Xiao Bai disappearing.

"Mind Demon Space?" Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and he muttered to himself, "My Lian Shen technique has already been activated, and my mind is filled with a cool, clear sensation."

Suddenly, a black shadow flashed in front of him, and a black-clothed girl stumbled forward, her hair disheveled, and her eyes wide with fear.

It was Nangong Wan.

" Husband, save me! I've recovered my memories, and the people from the Wheel of Reincarnation are chasing me, they want to capture me and take me to the Heavenly Court, save me!" Nangong Wan's voice was shrill, and her face was pale, making Han Li's heart ache.

"There's no one chasing you," Han Li said calmly, looking at Nangong Wan.

"Husband, I'm so scared!" Nangong Wan's eyes welled up with tears, and she stumbled forward, about to throw herself into Han Li's arms.

Han Li's eyes flashed with a hint of strange energy.

Just as Nangong Wan was about to throw herself into his arms, Han Li's eyes flashed with a cold light, and he raised his hand.

A thick, golden lightning bolt shot out from his hand, piercing Nangong Wan's chest, creating a bloody hole.

"Husband, you...!" Nangong Wan's voice was filled with shock and pain, as she stumbled backward, her eyes fixed on Han Li.

"It's indeed a very realistic illusion, but unfortunately, it's no use against me," Han Li's face was calm, and his fingers suddenly spread apart.

The golden lightning bolt split into five, and shot out in all directions, tearing Nangong Wan's body into several pieces.

Nangong Wan let out a blood-curdling scream, and her body dissipated into a cloud of black smoke.

The gray space around them also disappeared, and Han Li found himself back on the giant bird's back.

He let out a sigh of relief, but his eyebrows furrowed again.

He had killed the mind demon, but the evil corpse inside him was stirring, and a strong desire to kill and slaughter was rising up.

Han Li quickly activated his divine sense and the Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue, trying to suppress the evil thoughts in his heart.

"The Tianmo can actually affect the evil corpse, I see why Yue Men told me to be careful," Han Li thought to himself.

Before he could suppress the evil thoughts, another invisible wave of energy appeared, and Han Li's surroundings changed again.

He found himself in a purple space, with a slender figure in purple standing in front of him, her back to him.

Although he couldn't see her face, Han Li recognized her as Zi Ling.

His eyebrows furrowed, and he charged forward, his hand raised.

A thick, golden lightning bolt shot out from his palm, striking down towards Zi Ling.

But Zi Ling's body flashed, and she disappeared from her original position, reappearing dozens of feet away, avoiding Han Li's attack.

"Brother Han, why do you want to kill me?" Zi Ling turned around, her face filled with shock and anger, questioning Han Li.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and he waved his hands repeatedly.

A series of golden lightning bolts shot out, and in an instant, they condensed into a massive, golden lightning net, covering an area of dozens of miles.

The golden lightning net flashed with lightning, and descended towards Zi Ling, creating a series of residual images, its speed so fast that even a Da Luo realm cultivator might not be able to react in time.
Zi Ling's body flashed again, and she seemed to teleport away from the golden lightning net's range.

However, Zi Ling was unable to completely dodge Han Li's attack this time. Her right arm was grazed by the lightning net, and her right hand's clothes exploded, revealing a bloody wound.

"It seems you really want to kill me," Zi Ling said, her eyes filled with tears. "I've spent so many years cultivating, all for the sake of ascending to the Heavenly Realm, and to be with you, to cultivate the Great Dao together. But instead, I've been met with emptiness, and now the person I love is trying to kill me!"

Han Li knew that the person in front of him was a Heavenly Demon's illusion, but hearing these words still stirred up ripples in his heart. However, he did not let his emotions affect his judgment, and the golden light around him grew stronger.

The True Word Treasure Wheel appeared behind him, and countless golden waves emerged, instantly covering Zi Ling's body.

Zi Ling's body stiffened.

Han Li's five fingers clenched, and the golden lightning net suddenly shrunk, enveloping Zi Ling and forming a golden lightning ball.

With a loud "boom," the golden lightning ball exploded, and Zi Ling disappeared without a trace.

The purple space disappeared, and Han Li returned to the back of the giant green bird.

His face was pale, and his eyes had a hint of bloodiness. The evil intent in his heart grew stronger.

But before Han Li could catch his breath, another wave of Heavenly Demon energy arrived.

This wave was much stronger than the previous two.

Han Li's vision blurred, and when he opened his eyes again, he saw a world filled with golden light.

This world was filled with a strong, metallic law of familiarity, and Han Li could not sense any falseness.

A giant, golden figure stood before him, and it was none other than the Nine Yuan Dao Zu, Li Yuanji. He emitted a powerful, crushing aura that made Han Li's bones creak, and he could barely move.

"Han Li, you sneaked into the Nine Yuan Observatory's forbidden area, injured the Ghost Spirit Son, and helped the people of the Reincarnation Hall steal the precious treasure," Li Yuanji said, his face cold and stern. "I was going to spare you because of our past connection, but the majority of the Nine Yuan Observatory's people opposed it, so you will still die here."

Li Yuanji's face turned even colder, and he made a grasping motion with his hand.

The nearby golden light flashed wildly, and a thousand-meter-long golden divine sword appeared, slashing towards Han Li.

The golden divine sword left a massive spatial rift in the golden space.

Han Li's pupils constricted, and he used the "Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique" and the "Refine Spirit Technique" to their fullest extent. The golden light around him suddenly brightened.

With a loud "boom," Han Li broke free from the pressure binding him.

Han Li's face did not change, and he ignored the golden divine sword's sharpness. He punched out with all his might.

A massive explosion shook the golden divine sword, and it rebounded, then exploded into a thousand pieces, scattering golden fragments everywhere.

Han Li's fist was also severely injured, with his skin torn open and his bones exposed. Blood gushed out, but he did not care.

Li Yuanji's eyes widened, and he smiled coldly. He waved his hand, and a brilliant golden light appeared.

Han Li's head was surrounded by a burst of golden light, and a series of golden sword silhouettes appeared, densely packed and seemingly endless.

The swords shot down towards Han Li like a storm, forming a "sword rain" that seemed to want to pierce him like a beehive.

The nearby space was filled with the intense, metallic law of familiarity, and it seemed to be on the verge of collapse.

Han Li, however, did not care about the situation around him. He shot forward like a bolt of lightning, charging towards Li Yuanji, and was pierced by the swords.

But he still managed to reach Li Yuanji.

Li Yuanji's face was cold and stern, and he slapped Han Li with his hand.

The entire golden space seemed to compress, pressing down on Han Li.

But just as Li Yuanji was about to deliver the final blow, a brilliant golden light erupted from Han Li's body, and a massive temporal law of familiarity enveloped the golden space, freezing everything in time.

Han Li's speed increased by tens of times, and he turned into a golden arrow that pierced Li Yuanji's body.

Li Yuanji's body exploded, and the golden space around him disappeared.

Han Li's vision blurred, and he found himself back on the giant green bird.

His injuries had disappeared, but his eyes had turned half-white and half-red, and his body was shaking uncontrollably.

"Not good..." Han Li struggled to suppress the evil intent in his heart, but it was no use. The killing intent grew stronger.

But just as he was about to lose control, he saw that the giant green bird had flown out of the Heavenly Demon cloud's range.

Without the influence of the Heavenly Demon cloud's energy, Han Li's evil intent stopped growing, and he could barely control it.

He let out a sigh of relief, and a hint of joy appeared in his eyes.

Luckily, the giant green bird had flown out in time. If they had stayed inside, he would have been completely consumed by the evil intent.

The small white creature beside him, who had been trembling with fear, slowly opened its eyes, and its face relaxed slightly.
