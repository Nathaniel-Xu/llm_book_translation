Here is the translated text:

"Speaking of this matter, I happen to know some things. It's said that your little friend is quite talented, using herself as bait to lure out the Nine Yuan Sect's Golden Devouring Spirit, which had been nurtured for many years. Although she successfully devoured it in the end, she was discovered by the Nine Yuan Sect and was caught by several high-ranking cultivators. She's now being held captive within the sect."

Jiao San replied, "Han Li, you don't need to worry too much. The Golden Devouring Spirit is a rare and precious treasure, and the Nine Yuan Sect won't mistreat her. They'll probably take good care of her, but she won't be able to regain her freedom for the time being."

Han Li listened to her words and understood the underlying meaning. Once the Golden Devouring Spirit gained her freedom, it would be the day she was tamed by the Nine Yuan Sect.

Han Li wasn't too concerned about this, as he knew that taming the Golden Devouring Spirit wouldn't be an easy task. He was more worried that the Golden Devouring Spirit's stubborn nature would get her into trouble.

Although the Golden Devouring Spirit's physical body was nearly indestructible, it wasn't invincible. With the Nine Yuan Sect's deep resources and potential other methods, Han Li couldn't help but feel a sense of unease.

After all, the Golden Devouring Spirit had accompanied him for most of his cultivation journey and held great significance for him. He wouldn't sit idly by and watch her suffer.

"Anyway, our next task at the Reincarnation Hall will be related to the Nine Yuan Sect. If you're willing to participate, Han Li, you can use this opportunity to rescue the Golden Devouring Spirit."

Jiao San saw Han Li's contemplative expression and continued, "The rules of the Reincarnation Hall are clear. Some things can't be revealed yet, and there's still a long time before the task begins. You can use this time to improve your cultivation."

Han Li asked, "What's the task?"

Jiao San replied, "I'm not at liberty to disclose the details yet. But I can tell you that it's related to the Nine Yuan Sect. As for the Golden Devouring Spirit, she's being held captive within the sect."

Han Li thought for a moment before asking, "Jiao San, do you have a map of the Golden Source Sacred Realm? Could you give me a copy?"

Jiao San's eyebrows furrowed, and she replied, "Han Li, you don't need the map. You're not planning to go to the Nine Yuan Sect, are you?"

Han Li's expression remained unchanged as he replied, "I just want to gather some information. I won't do anything reckless."

Jiao San smiled and said, "Han Li, you're misunderstanding. The Golden Source Sacred Realm is not what you think it is. There are many sacred realms in the mortal world, and most of them are small and unknown. The Golden Source Sacred Realm is a small realm that shares the same name as a larger realm."

Han Li asked, "Are there different sizes of sacred realms?"

Jiao San replied, "Most cultivators below the Golden Immortal realm don't know about this. The entire realm is divided into three levels: thirty-six top-level realms, five hundred mid-level realms, and three thousand small realms. However, the exact number is unknown, as no one has the time to count them."

Han Li asked, "I've heard of the Middle Earth Sacred Realm. Is it one of the thirty-six top-level realms?"

Jiao San replied, "Yes, the Middle Earth Sacred Realm is the first of the thirty-six top-level realms. The Golden Source Sacred Realm is also a well-known realm, and the Nine Yuan Sect's mountain gate is located within it. The small Golden Source Sacred Realm we're currently in was originally part of the larger realm, but it was separated during a great upheaval in the heavens and earth."

Han Li nodded and said, "I understand now."

Just then, Jiao San's eyes flashed, and she suddenly attacked Blue Color with a palm strike, hitting her in the chest. Blue Color stumbled backward, coughing up blood.

The others were shocked, but they quickly understood the situation. Blue Color struggled to sit up, her face filled with terror.

Jiao San prepared to attack again, but Han Li intervened, blocking her path.

"Jiao San, this person is a disciple of the Nine Yuan Sect. We can't let her go," Jiao San said.

Han Li replied, "Even so, she doesn't deserve to die."

Jiao San said, "Han Li, this woman has been with us for too long. We can't guarantee she won't reveal our secrets if she returns to the Nine Yuan Sect. You're being too soft-hearted."

Han Li thought for a moment before saying, "Earlier, she and her brother made a promise to me. They didn't betray me even when they were pressured by the old woman. I think she's a trustworthy person. If she promises not to reveal our secrets, I can spare her life. I'll just need to plant a soul seal on her later."

Jiao San suggested, "Why bother? Let's just kill her and be done with it."

Han Li's expression turned serious, and he said, "Jiao San, if you consider me a friend, please do me a favor and spare her life."

Jiao San looked at Han Li and Blue Color, then nodded and said, "I understand... Fine, I'll spare her life."

Han Li bowed and said, "Thank you."

He then turned to Blue Color and said, "You don't have a choice right now. I'll plant a soul seal on you, and as long as you don't betray me, you'll be safe."

Blue Color didn't speak, but she nodded and looked pitiful.

Han Li began to plant the soul seal, and a thread of crystalline light emerged from his brow, entering Blue Color's forehead.
As Han Li was casting his spell, Jiao San's figure flashed by, arriving at the bottom of the deep pit.

Hei Tian Mo Zu was playing with the flames, completely absorbed in his own world, and when he saw her follow him down, he suddenly became annoyed, raising his hand to slap her.

"Shi Qianbei, don't move, I have something important to discuss with you," Jiao San exclaimed, also taken aback.

"Key, what key do you have? Take it out and let me see..." Shi Kong Mo's raised hand hovered in mid-air, his curiosity getting the better of him.

"Shi Qianbei, you've been searching for your wife and child, I might be able to help you," Jiao San said, taking a deep breath.

Shi Kong Mo's expression changed in an instant, his face filled with anxiety, repeatedly asking, "Do you know where they are? Do you know where they are? Where are they?"

"I don't know where they are, but I might be able to help you find them," Jiao San said, her expression softening slightly.

Shi Kong Mo's face turned cold, his eyes flashing with a fierce light, and he growled, "Huo Tai Sui once deceived me with similar words, if you dare to do the same, I'll make you suffer a fate worse than death."

Jiao San's forehead broke out in cold sweat as she hastily replied, "I wouldn't dare."

Shi Kong Mo's expression eased, and he began to laugh maniacally, "Haha, haha, haha... You wouldn't dare, that's good, that's good..."

His eyes returned to normal, and he quickly regained his usual eccentric demeanor, as if the fierce expression had never existed.

"Then, Shi Qianbei, why don't you follow me back to the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall?" Jiao San ventured.

"Return, return, find people, find people..." Shi Kong Mo chuckled to himself.

The two of them returned to the surface, where Liu Zi Yin greeted them, saying, "Thank you for rescuing me, I should have returned to the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall with you, but I have some other matters to attend to, please excuse me."

"Are you returning to the Savage Wilderness Domain with Huo San?" Jiao San asked, glancing at Huo San in the distance.

Liu Zi Yin nodded, "Yes, that's right."

"It's no problem, the Hall Master has already instructed me about this," Jiao San said.

Liu Zi Yin's eyes narrowed slightly, a hint of surprise flashing across his face, but he didn't ask any further questions.

"Brother Han, will you be returning to the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall with me?" Jiao San asked, turning to Han Li.

"I'll pass for now, Brother Han, I have some matters to attend to, I won't be returning with you just yet, but our previous agreement still stands, I'm willing to join the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall and participate in the hall's tasks," Han Li replied with a smile.

Jiao San's eyebrows furrowed slightly, but she quickly smoothed out her expression, saying, "If that's the case, then I wish you a smooth journey, Brother Han, I'm sure we'll meet again soon."

After bidding farewell to everyone, Jiao San departed with Hei Tian Mo Zu and Huai Yang Zi, leaving first.

Liu Zi Yin, accompanied by Li Qi Ma and Huo San, stood aside, seemingly discussing something.

Han Li merely glanced at them before turning his attention back to Qu Lin.

"Brother Qu, what are your plans? Will you continue to travel with me?" Han Li asked with a smile.

"I originally intended to, but now I might have to change my mind," Qu Lin replied, smiling.

"Oh? Why is that?" Han Li asked, curious.

"After this incident, combined with your previous actions at the Golden Origin Immortal Palace, I think your reputation has already spread throughout the Heavenly Court, if I continue to travel with you, wouldn't I be drawing attention to myself, making it easier for others to surround and attack me?" Qu Lin shook his head, "That wouldn't be wise."

"You make a good point," Han Li nodded in agreement.

In reality, after their previous encounters, both of them had realized that the other was not someone to be underestimated, and neither of them wanted the other to remain by their side, so they were in agreement.

Han Li also knew that Qu Lin had his own calculations, as a Devouring Gold Immortal, he should be able to sense the presence of others of his kind, and now that they were in the outside world, he would be able to find his own way.

"Since that's the case, then let's part ways for now, Brother Qu, we'll meet again in the future," Han Li said, cupping his hands in a gesture of farewell.

Qu Lin bid farewell and departed, his figure disappearing into the distance.

"Brother Lan, are you planning to return to the Jiuyuan Observatory?" Han Li asked, transmitting his voice to Lan Yan.

Lan Yan's expression changed slightly, and he nodded.

"Then, Brother Lan, would you be so kind as to accompany me for a while? I also need to head to the Great Golden Origin Immortal Domain," Han Li said.
