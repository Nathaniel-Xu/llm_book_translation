The three individuals stopped handling the jade boards in their hands, raised their eyes to look over, and their gazes fell upon the blue mask. At the same time, they formed a hand seal and pointed.

A gray light, a silver light, and a white light shot out from their fingertips, entering the blue mask.

The silver light contained countless silver symbols that jumped and danced, causing the surrounding space to distort and twist with each movement.

The gray light, however, did not produce any ripples or fluctuations, as if it were a void-like substance.

The white light pulsed and changed into various forms, creating a dazzling display that left one's eyes blurred.

The tall, robust man from the Reincarnation Hall bowed deeply, not daring to look at the three individuals as they cast their spells. He lowered his head and waited.

These three individuals held high positions within the Reincarnation Hall, and the masks they created possessed the three great divine abilities of remote transaction, concealment, and shape-shifting. The blue mask floated up, hovering in mid-air, and three-colored spirit patterns emerged on its surface - silver, gray, and white.

The patterns slowly spread across the mask, covering its entire surface.

The three individuals stopped casting their spells, and the blue mask shot up into the air, flying swiftly and emitting a clear, crisp humming noise, as if it were a blue spirit bird.

The man from the Reincarnation Hall waved his hand, sending out a white light that enveloped the mask and pulled it back to his hand.

The three-colored spirit patterns on the mask quickly disappeared, leaving behind a newly refreshed mask that radiated a vibrant, dynamic glow.

"Thank you, esteemed sirs!" The man from the Reincarnation Hall bowed respectfully to the three individuals, then put the mask away and left.

The three individuals continued to handle the jade boards, working diligently.

Before long, the door to the side hall was pushed open once more, and another person from the Reincarnation Hall entered, holding a green mask and requesting that the three individuals cast their spells.

The three individuals repeated the process, inscribing spirit patterns onto the mask.

The green mask took slightly longer to inscribe than the blue mask.

After completing the green mask, a red mask was brought in, and the three individuals continued to cast their spells, inscribing spirit patterns onto mask after mask. Only after completing over a hundred masks did they finally have a brief respite.

The characters on the jade boards ceased to jump out, and the three individuals temporarily stopped working.

The middle-aged man in gray and the white-robed woman both looked tired, while the purple-robed old man remained serene and composed.

"Stone's cultivation has become increasingly profound, and it seems that it won't be long before he reaches the peak of the Great Luo middle stage. Who knows, perhaps he'll even advance to the Great Luo late stage in the future," the middle-aged man in gray said with a hint of admiration.

The purple-robed old man chuckled and replied, "Lu's concealment technique has become increasingly mysterious, and the masks we've created have improved significantly. As for advancing to the Great Luo late stage, I wouldn't dare to have such wild ambitions."

The middle-aged man in gray shook his head and said, "My concealment technique is just a minor art, and it can't compare to Stone's spatial technique or White's shape-shifting technique."

The white-robed woman snorted and said, "The Hall Master is currently engaged in a battle with the Heavenly Court, and he's entrusted us with handling the rear. We can't afford to make any mistakes, so you two should focus on your work and avoid idle chatter."

The middle-aged man in gray smiled awkwardly.

However, the purple-robed old man's expression turned stern, seemingly displeased with the white-robed woman's words.

"White Feather, Stone may be working in our Reincarnation Hall, but he's not one of us. You shouldn't be rude to him," a white-robed youth said as he emerged from the depths of the side hall.

The youth's features were exceptionally handsome, but his expression was tinged with a deep sadness, as if he had experienced countless heartbreaks.

"Huangfu Domain Master!" The middle-aged man in gray immediately stood up and bowed, followed by the white-robed woman.

"It's all right, I know I was wrong," the white-robed woman said, offering an apology to the purple-robed old man.

The purple-robed old man also stood up, waved his hand, and then bowed slightly to the white-robed youth.

The white-robed youth was none other than Huangfu Yu, the Domain Master of the Reincarnation Hall's Jin Nan Domain, who had appeared in the Gray Realm.

"You three don't need to be so formal," Huangfu Yu said with a smile. "You've all been working tirelessly to create masks and handle the Reincarnation Hall's affairs. It's been a difficult task."

The three individuals stood up, and the middle-aged man in gray said, "We're willing to guard this place, so we don't feel any hardship. Huangfu Domain Master, how is the war between our Reincarnation Hall and the Heavenly Court going?"

Huangfu Yu replied, "The situation is still unclear, but as long as we work together, with the Hall Master's divine ability, we should be able to defeat the Heavenly Court."

The three individuals nodded in agreement, and Huangfu Yu smiled, seemingly pleased.

He then turned to the purple-robed old man and said, "I'll speak with you later, Stone."
Huangfu Yu said, "Stone Daoist, I hope you can help me with the trade between my Reincarnation Hall and Guangyuan Zhai. After all, Guangyuan Zhai is slightly better than my Reincarnation Hall in terms of trading ability. As for the expenses, I will compensate you after the war is over."

The old man in purple robes nodded in agreement. "It's only natural to do my part."

Huangfu Yu smiled slightly and said, "With your assurance, I can feel at ease."

He gave a few more instructions and turned to leave the side hall.

A moment later, Huangfu Yu's figure appeared at the peak of Jufeng Mountain, looking up at the sky as if gazing at something.

...

At the Bodhi banquet.

After a round of music and dance, everyone's excitement began to build up, for they were about to achieve their main goal for coming here.

"The wine has been poured three times, and the beauty has been appreciated seven times. I think everyone is getting impatient. This Bodhi banquet will follow the old tradition and distribute Bodhi fruits to everyone. However, this time, there's a slight difference..."

White Cloud Daoist's words were not finished, and the crowd couldn't help but wonder, "Could it be that this year's Bodhi fruit requires some kind of exchange or condition to obtain?"

The venue was filled with whispers and murmurs.

"Everyone, please be patient. The Supreme Master's dao is supreme, and his heart is benevolent. He has vowed to help all living beings enter nirvana and attain enlightenment. The Bodhi banquet is meant to help all living beings attain enlightenment on their own. This is the Supreme Master's highest dao realm. Therefore, this time, the Bodhi fruit will be distributed widely, and everyone who attends, regardless of whether they are guests or junior disciples, will receive a Bodhi fruit to help them attain enlightenment earlier."

The crowd heard this and first let out a sigh of relief, then burst into cheers and applause.

"Thank you, Supreme Master, for your generous gift..."

"Thank you, Supreme Master!"

The host, Guo or Jin, smiled and nodded slightly.

The master of the Reincarnation Hall watched this scene with a hint of a smile on his face, but he didn't say a word.

A moment later, eight giant immortal birds appeared in the sky, each carrying an eight-treasured square box in their mouths. They flew in different directions, leaving behind a trail of light.

These eight boxes contained the Bodhi fruits to be distributed to the other sub-venues.

After the Bodhi fruits were sent away, the main venue began to distribute the fruits to each of the attending cultivators, including the master of the Reincarnation Hall.

He picked up the Bodhi fruit in front of him and examined it carefully, only to find that it was a bright red fruit resembling a plum, unlike the pill he had imagined.

The fruit's bright red color was not like the color of red silk, but rather, it was translucent and glowing, like a small red lantern, emitting a fragrant aroma that was intoxicating.

The master of the Reincarnation Hall looked at the Bodhi fruits in front of Guo or Jin and the others, and found that they were all the same, likely the highest grade.

The crowd was excited, and those in the first row, including the Daoist ancestors and the great Luo cultivators, were able to maintain their composure, but the rest of the people were overjoyed and couldn't contain themselves.

They carefully held the Bodhi fruits, as if they were holding their own hearts, and their eyes were fixed on the fruits.

However, the Supreme Master had not spoken yet, so no one dared to consume the Bodhi fruit privately.

"Everyone, please don't be restrained. The Bodhi fruit has been distributed, and it's meant to be shared and enjoyed together." Guo or Jin said with a warm smile.

He picked up the Bodhi fruit in front of him and put it in his mouth, taking a bite. The light and fragrance spread out.

The crowd saw this and followed suit, carefully putting the Bodhi fruits into their mouths.

The entire venue was filled with light and fragrance.

The white-haired old woman, Meng Po, held the Bodhi fruit in front of her and took a bite, but instead of swallowing it, she discreetly put it away.

Behind her, Yu Menghan did the same, putting the Bodhi fruit away without consuming it. She thought to herself, "If I ever meet him again, I'll give him this Bodhi fruit as a gift."

The master of the Reincarnation Hall picked up the Bodhi fruit and examined it carefully, then snickered and crushed it in his hand, turning it into a stream of light that he absorbed into his sleeve.

The Time Daoist saw this and raised an eyebrow, but didn't show any displeasure.

After everyone had consumed the Bodhi fruit, the sound of bells echoed through the venue, and the sound of heavenly music filled the air.

The surface of the Jingming Lake rippled, and the giant ancient tree behind it began to sway gently. The leaves flew off, scattering throughout the venue, and their green color gradually faded, turning into crystal-like leaves.

Many of the cultivators in the venue seemed to have a sudden realization, and they sat down, closed their eyes, and began to meditate.
