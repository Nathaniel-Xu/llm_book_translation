Han Li sensed the conflicting aura that was spreading, and a hint of understanding flashed through his mind.

That was the aura of the Heavenly Dao itself, bright and majestic, yet cold and ruthless, with no mercy for the living beings of the world.

The seven-colored ribbons flew into the air, pulled by the Bottle Spirit, like a seven-colored dragon stirring up the dark green clouds, and then charged into the chaotic vortex.

Guo or Jin watched Han Li and the others' actions, but did not intervene.

This was not because he was too confident, but because he needed to fully activate the grand array at this critical moment when the two vortices were fiercely competing.

Moreover, he needed to intensify his absorption of the chaotic laws that filled the world, and if he succeeded in advancing to the Chaos Dao Ancestor, he would become the embodiment of the chaotic power, and the laws of the world would be at his mercy, becoming a true creator god.

At that time, no one and no power could defeat him, and Han Li and the others would become the best sacrifices for him to create a new world.

"You're underestimating the power of chaos too much, aren't you? With just a Palm Heaven Bottle, you think you can turn the tables? You're just dreaming." Guo or Jin sneered, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

As he spoke, he raised his hands, and the dark green vortex above his head began to wildly swirl, absorbing the surrounding air at an incredible speed.

The vortex twisted and turned, and a massive, blurry face appeared.

The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth saw the face emerge and shouted, "Guo or Jin is merging with the Dao, that face is 10% complete, all is lost!"

The Demon Lord heard this and no longer held back, his body surging with demonic energy, his form rapidly expanding, and two massive, curved horns growing from his head, his handsome face disappearing, replaced by a gigantic, demonic creature.

With one step, the void beneath his feet shook violently, and a massive, silver ripple spread out, extending tens of millions of miles before slowly disappearing.

At the same time, the entire True Immortal Realm was affected, all space trembling with excitement, as if welcoming the birth of the Dao Ancestor who controlled this law.

In this battle, after Han Li, the Demon Lord, who had been stuck at the peak of the Great Luo for endless years, finally took a step forward, achieving the Dao Ancestor.

In fact, he, like the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth, had already possessed all the qualifications to become a Dao Ancestor, but was afraid of being envied by Guo or Jin, and on the other hand, was worried about the Heavenly Dao's erosion, so he had been self-sealing, not taking that step.

Now, he had nothing to worry about.

Becoming a Dao Ancestor or not, the feeling of the laws of the world and the Heavenly Dao's operation was almost completely different.

The Demon Lord's eyes flashed with a fierce light, and he raised his hands, striking out with a massive, spatial force.

Guo or Jin's body was instantly shattered, turning into a cloud of gray smoke.

But in the next instant, a gray light flashed, and his body reassembled.

"I've already merged with the Dao by half, all your efforts are doomed to fail." Guo or Jin laughed loudly.

At this moment, Han Li, who had been closing his eyes to control the Palm Heaven Bottle, suddenly opened them, a smile spreading across his face as he asked, "Doomed to fail? I don't think so!"

As soon as he spoke, a dazzling, seven-colored light appeared in the massive chaotic vortex, taking the form of a seven-colored dragon, tens of millions of feet long, stirring up the vortex.

On the dragon's head stood a blurry figure, arms crossed, with a confident expression - the Bottle Spirit.

The dragon charged upwards, then suddenly turned its head and plunged downwards, straight into the dark green vortex below.

As it entered the vortex, the dragon's body began to rapidly shrink, heading straight for the mouth of the Palm Heaven Bottle.

With the dragon's guidance, the chaotic vortex was transformed into a massive, swirling funnel, and the chaotic clouds poured in, flowing into the bottle.

"No, no, no, this is impossible..." Guo or Jin's eyes widened in disbelief as he shouted.

He frantically gestured with his hands, but couldn't stop the chaotic vortex from being absorbed by the bottle, and instead, he was pulled towards the bottle's mouth.

Enraged, he swung his hand, and a massive, chaotic blade of light flew out, barely separating him from the vortex, but he could only watch as the chaotic vortex was completely absorbed into the bottle.

The bottle, now containing the chaotic vortex, began to flash with colorful lights, making it seem transparent, and through the bottle, a gray, swirling vortex could be seen, still rotating rapidly.

Moreover, the Palm Heaven Bottle had not returned to its original shape, remaining in its massive, tower-like form, swaying back and forth, shaking violently.

"Bottle Spirit, this bottle..." Han Li asked, his brow furrowed with concern.

"I don't have time to explain, I need to help the Palm Heaven Bottle suppress this chaotic power." The Bottle Spirit's voice was urgent.

Han Li didn't dare ask more questions, remembering his previous attempt to refine the Palm Heaven Bottle, which had ended in failure.

But this was not his fault, the power within the bottle was too close to the Heavenly Dao, and only someone with a high enough realm or sufficient power could refine it.

"Variable, variable, still that variable... I should have killed you first!" Guo or Jin's body was shrouded in a cloud of chaotic mist, his voice filled with rage.

At this moment, he was no longer calm and composed.
The killing intent emanating from his body was almost palpable, and even the power of the Chaos couldn't completely conceal it.

"If you want to kill me, you're welcome to try," Han Li said with a smile, his hand behind his back.

"Don't be careless, this guy is now only one step away from becoming a Chaos Ancestor, and his laws are not affected by the Heavenly Way, so he can exert his full power. You two, on the other hand, need to be careful of the Heavenly Way's devouring," the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth warned.

As soon as he finished speaking, the void in front of them collapsed.

Gu Yuan or Jin's entire body seemed to merge into a gray mist, and the surrounding Chaos energy was like countless tentacles, constantly spreading out in all directions, devouring everything in the void.

"What's going on?" the Demon Lord asked in surprise.

"Without the Chaos Vortex providing the power of the laws, Gu Yuan or Jin has entered a state of madness, constantly absorbing power from the surrounding heaven and earth. This void is likely to be devoured by him," the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth said.

"Stone Daoist, seal off this space first, and try to block him from getting more power," Han Li shouted.

The Demon Lord didn't hesitate, and immediately activated the power of the laws.

A silver light burst out from his back, transforming into two massive silver wings that expanded to the sides, covering an area of tens of millions of miles in just a few breaths.

When the wings closed again, the area had already been isolated from the rest of the void.

"If I want to completely seal off this area, I'll have to fully commit to it, and I won't be able to participate in the battle," the Demon Lord said.

"Just seal off the space, and leave the battle to us," Han Li said.

The Master of the Wheel of Rebirth nodded in agreement.

"Alright."

The Demon Lord shouted, and his body began to blur and fade away.

His silhouette gradually dissipated, merging into the spatial barrier that isolated the heaven and earth. Four human-shaped statues appeared on the barrier, each with the Demon Lord's appearance.

At the top and bottom of the barrier, two massive silver arrays appeared, and a series of silver feathers floated in the void.

Each feather contained the true essence of the spatial laws, and although they looked like feathers, they were actually incredibly heavy.

The feathers floated in the void, gently falling onto the mist surrounding Gu Yuan or Jin. The mist, which was formed by the Chaos energy, was actually suppressed by the silver feathers, crumbling and dispersing.

Gu Yuan or Jin's figure reappeared, but his appearance had changed greatly. He no longer had the elegant and refined appearance of a transcendent being, but instead looked like a madman, with his clothes torn and his hair disheveled.

His legs, which had been damaged by the Heavenly Way's backlash, seemed to have recovered, and he stood barefoot, his eyes fixed intently on Han Li.

Han Li's heart tightened, and he summoned the 72 Qingtong Flying Cloud Swords, grasping them in his hand.

The Master of the Wheel of Rebirth looked at Han Li, then at Gu Yuan or Jin, and took a deep breath. He formed a hand seal, and the six wheels of reincarnation behind him began to spin.

A thousand years of hatred, a thousand years of resentment, all to be repaid in this moment.

The two enemies, who had been destined to clash, finally faced each other.

"Victory or defeat, it's all in this one move," the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth said, his figure charging forward.

The six wheels of reincarnation behind him flashed with light, and six pillars of reincarnation energy burst out, shooting towards Gu Yuan or Jin.

Gu Yuan or Jin's figure vanished, and his body was surrounded by the Chaos energy.

The next moment, he reappeared, having passed through the six pillars of energy, and stood in front of the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth.

"Too fast!" Han Li's heart tightened.

Under the Demon Lord's spatial laws, Gu Yuan or Jin was still able to move at such incredible speed, which was truly shocking.

"Die," Gu Yuan or Jin said, his palm striking towards the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth's throat.

The Master of the Wheel of Rebirth's eyes flashed with an unusual light, and his body began to blur and fade away.

But Gu Yuan or Jin's gray energy suddenly enveloped the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth, restoring his solid form, and his throat was instantly severed.

A sound of tearing flesh echoed through the air.

Han Li's eyes widened, and he saw the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth's entire neck being torn apart, and his head flying off towards the void.

"Stop!" Han Li shouted.

Gu Yuan or Jin didn't give Han Li a chance to react, and kicked the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth's head, causing it to explode.

As the head exploded, the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth's energy dissipated, and he was no more.
