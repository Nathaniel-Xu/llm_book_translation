"Master, is she alright?" Ti Hu returned to Han Li's side and asked softly.

"She's fine, she just exhausted her demonic energy, causing her foundation to become unstable. I've already smoothed out the hidden dangers within her body, and her demonic energy will recover on its own. But I didn't expect you to have such a good impression of Ye Susu, you've never been so kind to anyone before." Han Li said with a hint of surprise.

"I don't know... maybe it's because her spiritual energy is so pure, like a mountain spring, clean and far-reaching, it makes me feel comfortable." Ti Hu lowered her head, her voice filled with a hint of embarrassment.

"Spiritual energy... you can sense that?" Han Li's face showed surprise.

"I was in a coma, my vital energy was severely depleted, but my law comprehension improved, allowing me to sense the spiritual energy of every person. With this ability, no one can hide their true nature from me!" Ti Hu said with a hint of pride.

Han Li listened to her words, his face showing surprise.

Ti Hu's ability, if true, was indeed impressive. It was said that one could know a person's face but not their heart, and even with high cultivation and strong spiritual energy, one could only judge a person's character through experience and intuition.

"That's impressive, but what about my spiritual energy?" Han Li asked with curiosity.

"Master's spiritual energy is too vast, I couldn't sense it clearly, but overall, Master's spiritual energy is upright and just." Ti Hu glanced at Han Li, her voice hesitant.

"Upright and just, I'm afraid I don't deserve those words, being able to not betray my own conscience is already good enough." Han Li shook his head.

"Cultivation is a perilous path, and those who are too soft-hearted will not be able to go far. Sometimes, being too indecisive can harm oneself, and even harm those one cares about. Master may seem cold to outsiders, but you have your own principles and never betray them, which is rare in this vast spiritual world." Ti Hu shook her head, speaking seriously.

"I didn't expect you to have such insight after being in a coma for so long." Han Li laughed, his expression noncommittal.

He then turned his gaze, waving his hand to release a stream of cyan light that retrieved the storage devices from the five Golden Horse Sect members.

The five True Immortals' magical artifacts and treasures were of no interest to Han Li, but they did have some scriptures and information about the Jin Yuan Mountains and the surrounding forces, which was what he needed.

Han Li took out the scriptures and began to carefully read through them.

Ti Hu watched the scene, waiting quietly without interrupting.

More than an hour passed, and Ye Susu stood up, looking refreshed and revitalized, her vital energy fully recovered and her aura even stronger.

"Senior, not only did you save my life, but you also exhausted your own vital energy to help me break through my cultivation bottleneck. I, Susu, will never forget this kindness. If Senior has any tasks, please just command me." Ye Susu spoke with determination.

"It's nothing, don't worry about it." Han Li waved his hand, speaking lightly.

"If the two seniors don't mind, I'd like to invite you to stay in our Qing Huo Clan's Qing Huo City for a few days, and let me show you some hospitality." Ye Susu looked at Han Li and Ti Hu, a hint of expectation in her eyes.

Ti Hu didn't speak, looking at Han Li.

Ye Susu followed her gaze, also looking at Han Li.

"Alright, we'll come to the Jin Yuan Mountains to travel, and we don't have any specific destination in mind, so we'll take you up on your offer." Han Li nodded, agreeing.

"That's great, please follow me." Ye Susu's face lit up, and she spat out a stream of cyan flames that incinerated the five Golden Horse Sect members' corpses, then waved her hand to release a flying boat magical artifact.

Han Li watched Ye Susu's efficient and ruthless actions, nodding in approval.

The three of them boarded the flying boat, heading towards the depths of the mountains.

"By the way, I didn't ask for your names, seniors." Ye Susu controlled the flying boat, asking.

"I'm Han Li, and she's Ti Hu. You can just call us by our names, no need to use titles." Han Li's gaze flashed, not using his pseudonym.

Over the years, he had used pseudonyms to avoid trouble, but now that his true identity was no longer a secret, he didn't see the need to hide it anymore.

"Ah, I see, so it's Han Li and Ti Hu. I'll make sure to remember it, seniors. Although our Qing Huo Clan is a demon clan, we also know about etiquette." Ye Susu spoke seriously.

Han Li smiled lightly, not pursuing the matter further.

"Hehe, it was Master who saved you, not me. You can just call me Ti Hu, no need to use titles." Ti Hu laughed, approaching Ye Susu and taking her hand.

"This... " Ye Susu glanced at Han Li, seeing that he didn't seem to mind, and relaxed, starting to chat with Ti Hu.

The two women seemed to have a natural affinity, and Ye Susu was quite talkative, while Ti Hu was curious and asked questions like a child, quickly becoming familiar and laughing together.
Not long after, the flying boat arrived at a massive mountain valley.

This valley covered an area of several thousand miles, with a massive city built within it. The city was constructed using materials that were mostly gold in color, with walls that were extremely high and not much shorter than the surrounding mountains. The city did not stand upright, but instead curved inward from all sides, without fully closing in.

Around the city, dozens of massive gold-colored stone pillars stood, each topped with a gigantic gold-colored sphere hundreds of feet in diameter. It was unclear what they were used for.

At this moment, several streaks of light shot forth from the front, landing in front of the flying boat. Several figures in blue robes appeared, all of whom were members of the Qing Huo tribe.

"Master, you've returned!"

A tall, thin man led the group, his face filled with joy as he approached. However, upon seeing Han Li and Ti Huo standing beside Ye Su Su, his brow furrowed in a mixture of surprise and wariness.

"Who are you?"

"They are honored guests I've invited, and they have saved my life. You must not be rude to them," Ye Su Su said, her expression somewhat displeased.

The thin man was taken aback, his mouth opening as if to ask about Ye Su Su's encounter with danger. However, he restrained himself.

"Ah, I see. I apologize for my mistake earlier," the thin man said, bowing his head in respect to Han Li and Ti Huo.

Ti Huo shook her head, a faint smile on her face, indicating that she didn't mind.

Han Li ignored the thin man and the others, instead gazing out at the valley below. He noticed that the valley was home to a large wood-attribute spirit vein, with dense wood-attribute energy emanating from the earth. The valley was filled with lush green vegetation, and the air was filled with the scent of wood and gold.

The Qing Huo tribe had indeed found a suitable place to settle, surrounded by the energies of wood and gold. However, the materials used to construct the city below were unlike anything Han Li had seen before. The gold-colored stone had a faint, dark pattern on its surface, resembling the growth rings of a tree. It emitted a cold, gloomy energy that was distinct from the energies of the Jin Yuan mountain range.

"That's Jin Wu stone, found deep within the Jin Yuan mountain range. It can block the stealthy movements of metal beasts, and most cities within the Jin Yuan mountain range are built using this material. Otherwise, it would be impossible to live safely with those metal beasts around," Ye Su Su explained, noticing Han Li's gaze.

Han Li had also read about Jin Wu stone in the ancient texts he had obtained from the Jin Ma Sect. He nodded slightly in response.

The thin man, whose name was Ye Ping, noticed Ye Su Su's respectful attitude towards Han Li and Ti Huo, and his expression changed. He discreetly probed their cultivation levels, and his face immediately changed.

"Ah, I see that two esteemed seniors have arrived. Please follow me," Ye Ping said, bowing his head in respect as he led the way towards the city.

As they walked, Ye Su Su asked Ye Ping about her mother's condition, using a transmission technique to communicate with him. Ye Ping replied that the tribe's leader was still recovering from her injuries, and that the elder was watching over her.

Ye Su Su's expression relaxed, and she continued, "I've gathered all the materials needed for the Hua Xue Gui Yuan formation. I'm certain I can cure my mother's illness!"

Ye Ping's expression, however, was complex, and he didn't seem to share Ye Su Su's enthusiasm.

Han Li glanced at Ye Su Su and Ye Ping, noticing that they were communicating through a transmission technique. He wondered what was going on.

The group soon arrived at the city gate, where the words "Qing Huo City" were inscribed. The gate was guarded, but Ye Su Su's presence ensured that they were able to pass through without any issues.

Inside the city, the streets were wide and paved with a type of blue brick. The buildings were constructed using wood, and the architecture was unlike anything Han Li had seen before. Some of the buildings were even constructed using unpolished tree trunks, but they didn't seem to be in disarray. Instead, they blended in with the natural surroundings, giving the city a unique charm.

The city was also home to many tall trees, which added to its beauty.

"Our Qing Huo City may not be large, but it has its own unique charm. I think it's worth a look," Ye Su Su said, smiling.

Han Li nodded in agreement, glancing at Ti Huo.

Ti Huo seemed to be enjoying the city, looking around with a curious expression.

Han Li noticed Ti Huo's reaction and felt a mix of emotions. He was happy to see her so carefree, but at the same time, he couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. Ti Huo had become more lively and cheerful since her awakening, but it reminded him of the girl he had lost, Jin Tong. He wondered what had become of her and whether she had found what she was looking for.
