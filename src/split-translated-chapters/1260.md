The Chu Yu Xian Domain and the Jin Yuan Xian Domain were adjacent to each other, and were a small domain that was half the size of the Bei Han Xian Domain. However, due to its unique location, it was under the influence of the great Jin Yuan Xian Domain, and thus appeared to be prosperous and thriving.

However, the size of the domain determined the abundance of its resources, and even with close trade and exchange with other domains, the domain was unable to nurture large or medium-sized cultivation sects. Among them, the strongest was the Chu Yu Xian Palace.

As for the mountain, it was referring to the largest cultivation power in the Chu Yu Xian Domain, Ti Hu Shan.

Speaking of Ti Hu Shan, it was a rather interesting sect, its power was slightly stronger than that of the Zhu Long Dao in its heyday. Except for the old ancestors and the current master of the mountain, who were all Tai Yi realm cultivators, the rest were all Jin Xian cultivators.

This sect did not excel in cultivation techniques or alchemy, but was passionate about brewing various heavenly wines.

Their brewed heavenly wine was mostly beneficial for nourishing the spirit and body, and a small portion of special wine was also effective in helping cultivators deal with the five declines of heaven and man. As a result, it was highly sought after by many cultivators in the heavenly realm.

However, if that was the case, this wine would only have been able to attract the attention of cultivators below the Tai Yi realm. In reality, many Tai Yi and even Da Luo realm cultivators were also very fond of Ti Hu Shan's heavenly wine.

The reason was that Ti Hu Shan had taken the brewing of heavenly wine to an extreme.

The sect's location was also very distinctive, with the main peak being called Yu Hu Peak, which resembled a jade bottle. According to legend, there was a wine cellar beneath the peak, storing various types of heavenly wine brewed over the generations.

This wine cellar was a natural underground cave, and once it was opened, it was set as a forbidden area by the sect. Except for the master and the ancestors, as well as a few core elders, no one else was allowed to enter.

However, in the depths of the wine cellar, a hidden chamber had been opened up, with multiple layers of formations laid out to conceal all the unusual auras within.

At this moment, in a hidden chamber within the wine cellar, a young man sat cross-legged on a stone bed, his face covered with a black mask, his hands forming a seal, and his mouth murmuring incantations.

However, what he was murmuring was not a cultivation technique or incantation, but rather words of doubt and complaint.

After a moment, he seemed to be rather disappointed, and finally let out a long sigh, dispelled the seal, and removed the mask from his face, revealing a rather ordinary face, which was none other than Han Li.

At this time, a small white figure that had been waiting by the side hurriedly walked forward and asked:

"Master, how is it? Have you made contact?"

"No, I don't know what's going on with Jiao San, I've tried contacting her multiple times over the past few months, but I haven't received any response." Han Li shook his head and said.

"Could it be that she didn't escape, and was caught by the Jiuyuan Observatory?" The small white figure scratched its head and asked.

Han Li simply shook his head and didn't speak, as he had personally seen Jiao San and the others escape, and Li Yuan had not been able to catch them.

And he had tried to contact Jiao San in order to gather information about Nan Gong Wan, but for some reason, Jiao San had not responded.

"By the way, where did Jin Tong go?" Han Li scanned the surroundings, his brow furrowed in concern, and asked.

"Old big brother is bored, and probably went to steal wine again. Speaking of which, the wine here is really tempting." The small white figure looked around, and its mouth began to water.

Han Li heard this and couldn't help but rub his temples, feeling both a headache and a sense of helplessness.

Ti Hu Shan didn't have any other skills, but its brewing techniques were far superior to those of Hu Yan Dao. They used various heavenly vegetables and spirit fruits to brew over a hundred different types of heavenly wine, and even created a special wine called "Wu Mei Niang" specifically for female cultivators.

This "Wu Mei Niang" did not have the same intense wine aroma as other heavenly wines, but its clear color and sweet taste made it popular among female cultivators.

Jin Tong had discovered this wine after arriving at Ti Hu Shan, and had fallen in love with it after trying it.

As the two were speaking, a figure with a faintly floating aura walked in from outside, carrying a large black ceramic jar that was emitting a unique fragrance that combined the scent of wine and fruit.

"Uncle, I'm back..." Jin Tong's face was slightly flushed, and she sat down beside Han Li, hugging the wine jar.

"Didn't I tell you not to steal wine again?" Han Li's face turned stern, and he scolded.

"This wine is mine, I didn't steal it! Look, it's got my name on it..." Jin Tong argued, holding up the wine jar.

Han Li saw the two clumsy characters written on the jar, and his expression turned even more stern.
"This is not a joke? If we're seen by the people of Ti Hu Shan, our tracks will be exposed." Han Li's face turned stern, and he scolded.

Being scolded by Han Li, Jin Tong suddenly shivered, and the wine's effects on her body immediately dissipated.

"Even if we're exposed, it's not like we can stay here forever, it's so boring." She pouted, and her anger was also evident.

Han Li saw this and couldn't help but relax his expression, sighing, "I know you don't want to stay here, but you saw it earlier, the people of Lun Hui Dian caused a commotion in the Da Jin Yuan Xian Domain, and the surrounding small Xian Domains were all in an uproar. We just arrived at the Chu Yu Xian Domain, and the Tian Ting's monitoring Xian messenger followed us. If we don't hide here and wait for the storm to pass, once we go out, we'll be surrounded, and it'll be hard to escape."

"Hmph, if you want me to wait patiently, then don't stop me from drinking." Jin Tong coldly snorted, and said with a hint of anger.

Han Li saw this and sighed, just about to speak when his expression suddenly changed.

The next moment, a white light pillar burst through the top of the cave, directly penetrating the roof.

"Rumble rumble"

The entire Jade Hu peak shook violently, and a massive crater several thousand feet in diameter appeared on the eastern side of the mountain. The white light pillar that had burst through the roof filled the crater.

The white light pillar was surrounded by five figures floating in mid-air. The person in the center had purple skin, a solemn expression, and two thick eyebrows that flew into his temples, inspiring awe in those who saw him. He was quite tall, wearing a half-body golden scale armor, and looked like a ancient war god, with a majestic aura.

As for his aura, it was even more unfathomable, and he was clearly a late-stage Da Luo realm cultivator.

On his left and right stood a man and a woman, the man looked like he was in his eighties, with a face full of wrinkles, but his eyes shone with a golden light. The woman was younger, but her features were not outstanding, and her serious expression made her look even more unlikable.

These two wore the attire of Tian Ting's monitoring Xian messengers, standing beside the scale-armored man, and their expressions were somewhat constrained, revealing the man's immense prestige.

Behind the three, stood a thin, red-nosed old man, and a middle-aged man in golden robes, their auras were far inferior to the three.

The thin old man had a flustered expression, and his eyes would occasionally glance at the crater below the light pillar, filled with a pained expression. The middle-aged man in golden robes looked around, his eyes gleaming with curiosity.

They were the old ancestor of Ti Hu Shan, and the palace master of the Chu Yu Xian Palace, who should have been in control of their own territory, but in front of these three, they didn't dare to make a move.

Behind them, hundreds of feet away, stood thousands of people, mostly local cultivators from the Chu Yu Xian Domain, and Ti Hu Shan's elder disciples.

Above them, ten Tian Ting cultivators wearing the attire of monitoring Xian messengers stood in the air, each holding a spell seal, and collectively controlling a silver mirror in the center.

The mirror emitted a dazzling white light, piercing through the Jade Hu peak.

"Yue Qing, according to my subordinate's view, the ones hiding in Ti Hu Shan are probably just a few insignificant rodents, not someone like Lu Chuan Feng or Tian Xing Zun. You don't need to personally come." The female monitoring Xian messenger said, looking at the scale-armored man.

The scale-armored man's eyes narrowed, and a flash of killing intent appeared, "Lu Chuan Feng has hidden so deeply, this time killing Feng Tian Xian messenger, causing our Tian Ting to lose face, and forcing me to come out of seclusion to take over the Da Jin Yuan Xian Palace. Whoever is hiding here, as long as they're remnants of the Lun Hui Dian, they will be thoroughly eradicated."

This Yue Qing, the scale-armored man, was originally a high-ranking official of Tian Ting, with immense power and authority. This time, the Da Jin Yuan Xian Domain's incident had gotten out of hand, and he was dispatched by Tian Ting to take control of the Da Jin Yuan Xian Palace.

Of course, the reason for dispatching him was not only to quickly quell the nearby Xian Domains' uprisings but also to secretly monitor and restrain the Jiu Yuan Guan.

As they spoke, the silver mirror in the air suddenly displayed a circular symbol, and the light pillar began to slowly retract, pulling back into the mirror.

Soon, three figures were pulled out of the ground, bound by the white light.

In the light, Han Li didn't wear his mask, as he had Jin Tong and Xiao Bai by his side, and his identity couldn't be hidden.

When the Tian Ting cultivators saw Han Li's face, they were first shocked, and then overjoyed.

"Is that really Han Li?"

The other monitoring Xian messenger's face lit up with a smile, and the wrinkles on his forehead smoothed out.

"Po Feng, Wu Hui, is this really Han Li?" Yue Qing asked, his eyebrows raised.

"Yes, it's him. Previously, Chi Meng sent back messages, emphasizing the need to deploy heavy troops to surround and capture him, and it was precisely this person." The female monitoring Xian messenger, Po Feng, hastily replied.
