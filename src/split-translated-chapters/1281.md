“Cough, cough… I say, three fellow daoists, as the saying goes, meeting in a foreign land is fate, considering we are all true immortal realm cultivators, and I have answered so many questions for you, can you please rescue me first, and then we can chat about other things?” The statue said hopefully.

“Rescuing you is not impossible, but we three have just arrived, and we want to gather some information about the Netherworld from you.” Han Li said nonchalantly.

“That's no problem, but I haven't been to many places in the Netherworld, I'm only familiar with the Black River Domain.” The statue said hastily.

“Black River Domain… is that a region in the Netherworld? How many regions are there in the Netherworld?” Han Li asked.

“Correct. The Netherworld is extremely vast, even the Netherworld's own people can't say for sure how big it is. I only know of three domains: the Black River Domain, the Earth Prison Domain, and the Yanluo Domain.” The statue said.

When Han Li heard the name "Yanluo Domain", his heart skipped a beat, and his expression remained unchanged as he continued to ask:

“Tell me about the Black River Domain.”

“The Black River Domain is vast, supposedly over a billion miles in area, and it's named after the black river below. Inside, there are places like the Fierce Ghost Wilderness, the Undead Forest, and the Blood Prison Gorge, with over a dozen locations, and a large number of ghostly creatures reside there, but the species are diverse, and not many possess spiritual intelligence…” The statue spoke incessantly.

Han Li gained a general impression of the Netherworld from the statue's words.

This place was not much different from the True Immortal Realm, the Demon Realm, or the Gray Realm, with various ethnic groups standing on their own mountains.

“Black River Domain, Earth Prison Domain, Yanluo Domain, these three major domains, which powerful individuals are there, and what are their strengths?” Han Li asked after a brief pause.

“I'm not too clear about that, I've only heard that the Netherworld has three great overlords, named Blood Li, King of the Underworld, and Ghost Witch, each ruling a domain. The Black River Domain seems to be under the control of Blood Li, as for the other two domains, I'm not sure which one they belong to. Mainly because there are few ghostly creatures in the Netherworld with spiritual intelligence, it's hard to gather information… As for the strengths of those three, I've heard they are extremely powerful, but I don't know the specifics.” The statue said.

“Do you know anything about the Yanluo Domain?” Han Li nodded and asked.

“I haven't been to the Yanluo Domain, but I've heard that the ghostly creatures there are very powerful, and the management is strict, unlike the Black River Domain, which is more chaotic.” The statue said after a moment of contemplation.

“Have you heard of a place called the Yanluo Manor in the Yanluo Domain?” Han Li asked directly.

“Yanluo Manor? I vaguely remember that I once searched the soul of a ghostly creature, and in its memories, I saw a place like that, located in the border region of the Yanluo Domain, it seemed very mysterious.” The statue hesitated, then fell silent, as if trying to recall.

“Do you still remember where that place is?” Han Li asked excitedly.

“I've been sealed here for who knows how many years, and a lot of things are hard to remember, but I should be able to try.” The statue said.

Han Li heard this and didn't immediately respond, instead, he glanced at the side and asked with a voice transmission:

“Qiuhun, can you judge whether this person is telling the truth or not?”

“This person has been sealed inside, I couldn't sense their divine soul, but judging from their tone, it should be true. Of course, it's also possible that this person is extremely skilled at deception.” Qiuhun replied with a voice transmission.

Han Li heard this and was convinced, just as he was about to speak.

“You said you're from the Wutu Xian Domain, Tu Huang Sect, which lineage of the Tu Huang Sect are you from?” Jin Tong suddenly asked.

Han Li and Qiuhun looked at each other in surprise.

“This fellow daoist is quite familiar with the Tu Huang Sect, I'm a disciple of the Kuzhu Peak lineage of the Tu Huang Sect, under the tutelage of Peak Master Yue Jing.” The statue said with another pause, then smiled.

Jin Tong heard this and didn't say anything else, instead, he winked at Han Li.

Han Li was curious about why Jin Tong was so familiar with the Wutu Xian Domain, but he didn't ask further, instead, he said:

“Alright, I'll release you, you'll take us to the Yanluo Manor.”

“Deal!” The statue immediately agreed.

Han Li smiled slightly and said to Qiuhun:

“Qiuhun, help me a bit, break open this seal.”

Qiuhun nodded.

“This seal is not simple, I've been studying it for many years, and I've grasped some of the key points, do you want me to tell you?” The statue asked.

“No need, this seal has weakened over time, I've already seen the weakness.” Han Li shook his head.

Then he transmitted to Qiuhun the location of the weakness, and the two of them began to cast their spells.

After a short while, Qiuhun on the left and Han Li on the right, both cast a beam of light at the statue.

Han Li used his immortal energy to strike the seal on the statue's right side, while Qiuhun covered the statue's entire body with his law energy.

The seal on the statue's body began to burn with a faint green flame, which spread and then merged, forming a circle around the statue.

As Qiuhun's law energy continued to flow into the statue, its body began to glow with a crimson light, and the stone skin covering its body began to peel off, revealing its true form.

The statue was actually a three-zhang-tall, muscular man with a bloody red complexion, covered in strange symbols that seemed to be full of primal power.

Moreover, his neck only had a block of blood scab, and there was no head, but on his chest, there were two eyes that shone with a golden light.
"What kind of thing is this..." Jin Tong's eyes widened as he took a step back, his voice trembling.

Ti Hu was also frowning.

"This guy... probably isn't from the Immortal Realm." Just as Ti Hu and Jin Tong were thinking this, they heard Han Li's voice in their minds.

"Kuo kuo kuo... kuo kuo kuo..."

A strange, maniacal laughter came from the decapitated man's body, causing Han Li and the others to instinctively take a step back, looking at him with a mixture of fear and curiosity.

The man's abdomen began to convulse, and a low, ominous sound echoed through the air.

"Finally free, finally out... Ha ha... didn't think you guys had the guts to break through this seal!" The decapitated man's voice grew louder, his tone dripping with madness and hatred.

His voice was completely different from before.

"Friend, since you've escaped, please keep your promise and lead the way." Han Li's hand was hidden in his sleeve, his palm glowing with a soft light as he prepared for battle.

"Ha! The Underworld is all about lies and deception, who keeps their promises? You'll make a fine sacrifice for my blood axe!" The decapitated man's abdomen convulsed again, his eyes gleaming with madness.

As he spoke, a bloody glow appeared in his hand, and he grasped a massive, three-zhang-tall blood-colored axe.

"Boom"

The decapitated man swung his axe, and a powerful aura burst forth from his body.

"A Da Luo peak cultivator, sealed away in this place... what kind of person are you?" Han Li's wrist flicked, and a bamboo sword appeared in his hand, its blade shining with a soft blue light.

"I am... Xue Li!" The decapitated man roared, his body glowing with a red light as he charged towards Ti Hu.

His movements were so fast that no one could see them clearly, and he appeared behind Ti Hu, swinging his axe in a vicious arc.

"Be careful..." Han Li shouted, his body flashing towards Ti Hu as he activated his time law.

Ti Hu also reacted quickly, dodging the axe by a hair's breadth.

However, the axe still managed to tear through his clothes, leaving a trail of blood behind.

At the same time, Han Li appeared behind Xue Li, his sword flashing towards the other man's back.

But Xue Li didn't turn around. Instead, his shoulder joint made a strange cracking sound, and his arm twisted in a way that seemed impossible, blocking Han Li's sword with his axe.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he activated his sword's law, unleashing a burst of golden light.

The light coalesced into a series of golden threads that crackled with energy, striking Xue Li's body and sending him stumbling back.

Xue Li's eyes closed, and he let out a pained cry.

Ti Hu took advantage of the distraction to fly towards Jin Tong, who was watching in shock.

Jin Tong's eyes widened as he saw Ti Hu's back, which was covered in blood and torn flesh. He was furious, and his body glowed with a golden light as he charged towards Xue Li.

But Xue Li was far from defeated. With a roar, he activated his axe, creating a massive, blood-colored vortex that absorbed the golden threads of energy.

The vortex grew larger and larger, until it was like a miniature tornado, sucking in everything around it.

Han Li's eyes widened as he realized what Xue Li was doing. He didn't try to attack the vortex directly, instead using his agility to dodge the attack.

Xue Li's body glowed with a fierce, red light as he charged towards Han Li, his axe flashing in the dim light.

But just as he was about to strike, a golden light flashed towards him, and Jin Tong appeared, his body transformed into a golden, lion-like creature.

Xue Li's axe flashed towards Jin Tong, but the golden creature didn't flinch, instead using its front paws to grasp the axe and hold it in place.

The sound of metal on metal echoed through the air as Xue Li tried to force his axe down, but Jin Tong's grip was like a vice, holding firm against the other man's strength.
