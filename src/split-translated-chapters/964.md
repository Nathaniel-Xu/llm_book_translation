"Ha ha, good kid, you're actually hiding so deeply, even Shao Ying isn't your match!"

Just then, a loud laughter resonated from within the blood array.

"Lord E is joking, I just used some underhanded tactics that can't be spoken of, compared to Lord E, it doesn't amount to anything." Han Li lifted his head to look, laughing as he slowly walked towards the sculpture beneath Chen Yang.

The remaining four people in the array were almost unable to support themselves, all of them slumped and sitting, seemingly without the energy to even lift their heads to take a glance, looking like they would soon lose their lives within the array.

On the other hand, E Mei's aura had reached an unprecedented peak, with over a thousand acupoints on his body already unlocked. If he were to continue absorbing the power of the great array, it wouldn't be a problem for him to break through all the acupoints on his body.

"Brother Li's Machiavellian tactics, to be honest, I, E, really admire. Now, I can choose to forgive your killing of Shao Ying, and give you another opportunity, what do you think?" E Mei gazed at the approaching Han Li, asking with a smile.

"I didn't expect the Lord to be so magnanimous, I, Li, am eager to hear the details." Han Li extended a finger, lightly tapping on the layer of blood-colored light screen, asking indifferently.

"As long as you take action to kill those two eyesores, you can join the Xuan Castle with Shi Kong, and become one of the most powerful elders in the castle. Of course, if you don't want to stay in Xuan Castle, you can choose to be the castle master of one of the four other castles - Qing Yang, Xuan Zhi, Bai Yan, or Tong Yu - as long as you agree to abide by my summons at all times." E Mei said seriously.

"Buddy Li, how can you believe this person's nonsense at this point? Morning City's Lord is a perfect example!" Xuan Yuan's face changed, shouting loudly.

Du Tong heard these words, and instinctively clenched his fists.

Han Li turned around to glance at the two of them, sighed, and slowly said:

"It's a pity that Lord E has made such a comprehensive plan for me, so that I wouldn't have to get rid of Shi Kong as well. Unfortunately, I'm not a person with the Accumulated Scale Realm like the rest of you, if I were, I wouldn't have been able to refuse this offer."

"Oh, is that so? Too bad, then all you can do is patiently wait for this blood array to complete its rotation, and then we can have a good exchange." E Mei's face remained unchanged, saying indifferently.

"Lord E is so busy, I see no need to wait any longer. I'll just come and visit you now." Han Li chuckled and said.

"Ha ha, Brother Li is indeed an impatient one! If you want to come in, I naturally welcome you, but I wonder if you have the capability to do so?" E Mei seemed to have heard the most ridiculous joke, laughing loudly.

"Do I have the capability or not, I'll leave it for Lord E to see." Han Li remained calm and collected, saying casually.

After that, he pinched his hands into a hand seal, and a series of obscure chanting sounds came from his mouth, as he raised his palm and struck the sculpture in front of him with great force.

A layer of snow-white light enveloped his palm, pressing onto the blood-colored light screen, which unexpectedly sank into it.

E Mei was about to say something else, but upon seeing this, his eyebrows furrowed in surprise.

However, when Han Li's palm touched the sculpture beneath Chen Yang, the blood-colored light screen suddenly erupted with a burst of bloody light, and 'Boom' resonated, as it bounced back.

E Mei's eyes narrowed slightly as he saw this, and his smile grew thicker.

Shi Chong Kung and the others had previously attempted to break the light screen, so when they saw Han Li fail, they weren't too surprised.

Han Li seemed to be unfazed, taking a deep breath as he moved to the sculpture beneath Sun Tu, repeating the same actions, chanting the incantation, and striking the blood-colored light screen once again.

The results were naturally the same, and he was only able to touch the sculpture before being bounced back by an invisible force.

His eyes flashed as he moved to the sculpture beneath Qin Yuan, striking the light screen once more.

"A mere cultivator with over two hundred acupoints, thinking of breaking the Blood Tears Barrier through brute force? You're not even a match for a madman's fantasy, no matter how many times you try, it's all useless." E Mei shook his head, saying disdainfully.

After that, he stopped watching Han Li, and instead closed his eyes, accelerating his absorption of the power of the blood and flesh within the great Blood Tears Array, displaying an air of tranquility.

Chen Yang and the others felt their bodies surge with an increased flow of power, and they let out a painful scream, though unfortunately, their voices weren't particularly loud due to their weakness.

Han Li ignored the strange looks from the onlookers, as after striking the sculpture beneath Fu Jian, he moved to the sculpture beneath E Mei's position, and struck again.

Only to see his two hundred and fifty acupoints erupting with light, his palm seeming to grasp a blazing sun, as it heavily chopped down towards the bloody barrier.

The moment his palm made contact with the blood-colored sculpture, a previously unseen, hidden symbol emerged from beneath the five sculptures.

Immediately after, a 'Hum' sound resonated, as the blood-colored light screen trembled violently, its surface rippling like a lake surface blown by the wind.

E Mei sensed that something was amiss, and suddenly opened his eyes, only to see a scene that left him incredulous.

Han Li pinched his hand seal, took a step forward, and unexpectedly, as if he had passed through a layer of water-screen light, directly entered the Blood Tears Great Array.

"How is that possible?" Everyone was shocked by what they saw.

Han Li smiled, his body leaping high into the air, as he stood at the very top of the light screen, higher than the five people on the sculptures by over a dozen feet, suspended in mid-air without falling.
"Worthy of being the Cry of Blood Array, indeed a world-class masterpiece. This vast and boundless power, just being in its midst, is enough to make one marvel...‚Äù Han Li deeply inhaled the air, sincerely praising.

"Impossible, being in the Blood Array, not using the Cry of Blood Chart as a basis, you would be directly used as a sacrifice... how is this possible?" E Chu's face was full of incredulity as he exclaimed.

"Lord E, are you referring to this?" Han Li asked with a smile.

As he spoke, the hand seals on his hands changed, and he drew a circle with his fingers. Immediately, a blood glow condensed under his feet, forming a five-pointed star pattern, identical to the one on the statues beneath E Chu and the others.

"Boom"

At that moment, a loud thud was heard from the blood-colored light screen below.

When Han Li looked down, he saw that Duan Tong, eager to save his master, had attempted to enter the Cry of Blood Array like Han Li. However, he was met with a massive counterforce and was bounced back, flying away.

Everyone present frowned, and even Zhu Zi Qing couldn't help but cover her mouth to stifle a laugh.

The people trapped in the blood cocoons, including Sun Tu, seemed to have caught a glimmer of hope, struggling to lift their heads and look towards Han Li. A glimmer of excitement flashed in their eyes.

Morning Sun, still struggling, managed to lift his head and gaze at Han Li's figure. Then, he looked up towards the sky outside, his expression complicated and difficult to decipher.

"Lord E, Li has arrived to pay his respects... I wonder if you're prepared," Han Li said, smiling.

His expression suddenly turned serious, and he rapidly changed his hand seals, accompanied by a rushed chanting sound.

A moment later, he let out a loud roar: "Bring it to me!"

A dull, muffled sound erupted from the depths of the array.

The five statues shook violently, with a string of new talismans appearing on their surfaces. The array's operation suddenly stagnated, as if it were about to stop.

However, the thick, sticky blood light from the blood pool below immediately began to surge upwards, madly pouring into the blood cocoon that Qi Jian had transformed into. It then passed through layer after layer of purification before entering E Chu's body.

E Chu's face revealed an unusual expression, and he seemed momentarily bewildered. Just then, the pure blood light that had entered his body astonishingly passed through his body once more, shooting towards Han Li and merging into his body in an instant.

"Gasp..."

Han Li let out a soft cry, and his entire body was enveloped in a blood glow. It was as if numerous fine blood threads had wrapped around him, forming a massive blood cocoon.

His body had once again become the endpoint of the array's blood light circulation.

As the powerful force surged into his body, Han Li's face contorted in agony, with intense, stabbing pains spreading through his meridians, making his teeth feel like they were about to shatter.

He had thought that the blood meat power, which had been filtered and purified by the previous individuals, would not be overly violent. However, the truth was that even his own body, which had opened over two hundred acupoints, was still somewhat too weak to endure.

Fortunately, Han Li was quite adept at enduring pain and could withstand it.

The blood cocoon on his body began to reveal over a thousand white light points, some of which were real and others illusory.

"How is this possible? How can you control the Cry of Blood Array? What kind of person are you?" E Chu's face was filled with incredulous shock as he asked.

Han Li completely ignored him, his eyes widening as he let out a triumphant, long howl.

He immediately closed his eyes and began to circulate the Tian Xia town prisoner skill, crazily integrating the blood meat power surging into his body to attack the acupoints that had yet to be opened.

"Boom" "Boom" "Boom"

In just a short span of ten-odd breaths, he successfully opened three acupoints in his chest, a speed that even surpassed E Chu's by threefold.

"What's going on...?" Liuxiang Fu's expression turned increasingly solemn as she muttered to herself.

Zhu Zi Yuan and the others were even more baffled, filled with shock and doubt.

"Brother... how is this possible? Could this human be related to the Grand Ruins?" Zhu Zi Qing whispered.

Shi Chuan Kong's expression was also complicated, and he couldn't fathom how Han Li had managed to rival E Chu in the blood array.

"No matter who you are, if you want to compete with me, let's see if you have the skills," E Chu said, his face darkening as he calmed down.

He suddenly pinched a hand seal and pointed at his own brow. A strange, crimson symbol appeared on his forehead, and the blood light surrounding his body immediately intensified, beginning to cut off the blood meat power flowing out of his body.

Han Li sensed that the blood meat power flowing into his body had suddenly decreased, and he turned to look at E Chu, smiling: "To find the root cause, that's the correct way. You're just misusing it, and you think you can rival me?"
