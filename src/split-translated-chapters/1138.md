"Never mind, with that old lunatic Shi Kongmo around, you losing control is nothing to worry about. However, the Pantian Bottle is a treasured item that the Supreme One requires, and currently, the Heavenly Court is busy preparing for the Bodhi Banquet, so there aren't many people available to send. Moreover, the Jinyuan Fairy Realm is within the jurisdiction of the Jiuyuan Observatory, so sending someone else to investigate wouldn't be suitable. Therefore, the task of investigating the Pantian Bottle still falls to your Heavenly Prison. Don't fail again, do you understand?" The white figure fell silent for a moment before continuing, their tone softening, and the pressure in the hall dissipating.

"Yes, I understand. I will immediately dispatch all the monitoring fairy messengers to the Jinyuan Fairy Realm to investigate Han Li's situation. This time, I will definitely retrieve the Pantian Bottle." Qimozi's face lit up with joy, and he continued to pursue Han Li, hoping to seize the opportunity to snatch the "Great Five Elements Fantasy World Secret". He happily agreed.

"There's no need to be so loud and showy, just keep it low-key. You've destroyed your physical body, and later, I'll send someone to deliver a Tianhuo Sacred Lotus to help you rebuild your dao body." The white figure added.

"Thank you for the great kindness, sir!" Qimozi's face lit up again, and he bowed deeply.

"Dismissed." The white figure waved their hand, speaking indifferently.

Qimozi bowed again, preparing to leave.

Just then, a red cloud flew in from afar, without announcing its arrival, and directly entered the great hall. It flashed and transformed into a red-haired woman.

The woman appeared to be around twenty years old, with skin as white as jade, eyebrows and eyes as beautiful as a painting, and a captivating aura. She was dressed in a long, red dress that tightly wrapped around her slender figure, making one's heart yearn for her.

However, despite her beauty, the red-haired woman's expression was filled with an unbridled arrogance, as if she was a blooming, fiery rose that wouldn't allow anyone to approach her.

"Ah, isn't this Qimozi, the prison master? I heard you suffered a defeat and had your dao body destroyed. I thought it was just a rumor, but it seems it's true." The red-haired woman glanced at Qimozi with a mocking gaze, her voice clear and melodious, yet filled with ridicule.

Qimozi's eyes flashed with anger, but he suppressed it.

"Greetings, White Cloud." The red-haired woman didn't say anything else, turned to the white figure on the high platform, and bowed casually, without the same level of respect as Qimozi.

"Ah, it's Chi Meng, no need to be so formal. How was your trip to the Green Forest Fairy Realm?" The white figure smiled warmly at the red-haired woman.

"Everything went smoothly, sir. I completed the tasks you assigned, and procured three thousand Green Heart Fairy Fruits, six thousand Earth Mother Coiled Peaches, and ten thousand Red Spiral Jade Fruits. They've all been delivered to the Hundred Treasures Department." The red-haired woman's lips curled up, and she spoke.

"That's good, these items will be used for the upcoming Bodhi Banquet. We can't afford any mistakes." The white figure nodded.

"Sir, please don't worry, I personally inspected all the fairy fruits, and they're all of high quality." The red-haired woman bowed.

"Chi Meng, you're diligent, and I trust you. This trip to the Green Forest Fairy Realm was tiring, so take a rest." The white figure nodded, speaking again.

"It was just a trip, sir. I don't feel tired at all. I overheard you and Qimozi discussing the Pantian Bottle earlier. Isn't it the same treasure that was stolen from the Jiuyuan Observatory?" The red-haired woman's eyes sparkled with interest.

Qimozi and Chi Meng didn't get along, and he was about to leave when he heard this, his expression changing.

"That's right, it's the same item. The Supreme One has ordered its retrieval, and you're interested in this matter?" The white figure asked.

"Of course, I'm interested, sir. I received a message from my grandmother, asking me to inquire about this matter." Chi Meng smiled lightly.

"Ah, Chi Rong, the Daoist friend? Has she come out of seclusion?" The white figure was surprised.

Qimozi's body trembled, seemingly intimidated by the name.

"Grandmother came out of seclusion a few years ago and asked me to greet White Cloud, sir." Chi Meng glanced at Qimozi with disdain.

"Ah, Chi Rong, please, you're too kind. I've been managing the Heavenly Court's affairs for many years, but I'm not good at it. There are many areas where I've been remiss. If Chi Rong were to take over, it would be a great relief for me, and I could finally take a break." The white figure chuckled.

"White Cloud, sir, you're joking. You've managed the Heavenly Court for many years, and the great fairy realms have reduced their conflicts, and the world is prospering. If another Daoist were to take over, they wouldn't be able to do as well as you. My grandmother once said that among the many Daoists in the Heavenly Court, White Cloud's abilities may not be the strongest, but his governance skills are unmatched." Chi Meng smiled.

"Ah, Chi Rong, you're flattering me." White Cloud laughed.

"Since Chi Meng is interested in the Pantian Bottle, Qimozi, you can tell her about the situation." White Cloud instructed.

"Yes, sir." Qimozi hesitated for a moment before agreeing and explaining the situation with Han Li.

"Ah, I see. So, this Han Li is an interesting person. He's only been in the immortal realm for a few tens of thousands of years, and he's already reached such a high level. His cultivation speed is truly remarkable." Chi Meng's lips curled up, revealing a hint of interest.

"Chi Meng, you don't know, the Pantian Bottle is a treasure of the heavens and earth. With it, one can seize the heavens and earth's creation, so it's not surprising that Han Li's cultivation speed is so fast." White Cloud spoke slowly.

"Ah, I see. White Cloud, sir, Qimozi's dao body has been destroyed, and it will take time to recover. Moreover, he's already failed to capture Han Li, and the other people in the Heavenly Prison wouldn't be able to do any better. Why not let me handle the task of capturing Han Li and retrieving the Pantian Bottle? I'll definitely bring them back to you, sir." Chi Meng suggested.

"Chi Meng, the task of retrieving the Pantian Bottle has already been assigned to me, sir. Last time, I was careless, but this time, I'll bring the Extinguishing Golden Wheel, and I'll definitely complete the task successfully." Qimozi interjected, his voice urgent.

"Qimozi, you don't even have a dao body, how can you complete the task? Rebuilding your dao body and solidifying your cultivation will take time, and by then, Han Li will have escaped. You can't possibly wait until you're fully prepared before going after him." Chi Meng ridiculed.
Qi Mozi's eyebrow twitched, and she was about to speak when

"Qi Mozi, Chi Meng said something reasonable, you haven't formed your Dao body yet, so just stay in the Heavenly Court to rest for now." Bai Yun Daozu suddenly raised his hand, stopping Qi Mozi from continuing.

"Yes." Qi Mozi stood there, looking somewhat unwilling under Bai Yun Daozu's gaze.

"Chi Meng, since you volunteered, the task of capturing Han Li is now yours, but Qi Mozi has already failed once, you absolutely cannot fail again." Bai Yun Daozu looked at Chi Meng and said seriously.

"Don't worry, White Cloud Elder, I'm not like some people, you can just wait for my good news." Chi Meng smiled and with a flicker of her body, transformed into a red cloud and flew away, disappearing from sight.

Qi Mozi didn't stay for long, quickly taking her leave and departing, leaving only Bai Yun Daozu in the grand hall.

"Chi Meng, your hand is getting longer and longer, hehe..." Bai Yun Daozu stood up, chuckling coldly before turning and walking towards the back of the hall.

...

At this moment, in another part of the Heavenly Court, a palace made entirely of semi-transparent pink crystal stood.

A green-robed woman sat within, none other than Miao Fa Xianzun.

Her face was somewhat somber as she gazed at a dark red jade tablet in front of her, upon which was a faint image of a yellow earth toad.

However, the jade tablet had already cracked and shattered into several pieces.

Two green-robed attendants stood beside her, their faces filled with fear.

"How are the life tokens of Lan Yuanzi and Lan Yan?" Miao Fa Xianzun slowly asked.

"Lan Yuanzi's life token has also cracked, but not completely shattered, as for Lan Yan's life token, there's no abnormality, but we've been unable to contact her, it's likely that she's been captured." One of the green-robed attendants hastily replied.

Miao Fa Xianzun's eyes narrowed upon hearing this, and she didn't speak for a moment.

"Saint Envoy, the Observatory Master has also heard about this, and just sent a message, expressing great anger at our failure to retrieve the Heaven's Vessel." One of the green-robed attendants hesitated before speaking in a low voice.

"I know, you can go now." Miao Fa Xianzun's eyebrows furrowed, and she waved her hand.

The two green-robed attendants bowed and quickly retreated.

"Han Li... it seems I underestimated you, in that case, I'll take action myself, and see just how capable you are." Miao Fa Xianzun stood up, speaking slowly.

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure flickered, and she vanished into thin air.

...

In the northwest border of the Xiao Jin Yuan Xian domain, the land was flat, and the soil was fertile, with a higher population density than the Jin Yuan mountain range, and many sects were present. The first sect of the Xiao Jin Yuan Xian domain, the Tong Tian Sword Sect, was located here.

Further northwest, the endless sea stretched out, with rich spiritual energy, but it was also extremely turbulent, causing massive storms to frequently occur, earning it the name "Stormy Sea". The Stormy Sea was abundant in resources, attracting many people to seek treasure, and its popularity was unmatched.

On the coast, a massive city stood, named Jin Yuan City.

Jin Yuan City covered an enormous area, and its interior was extremely prosperous, being the number one city in the Xiao Jin Yuan Xian domain.

The city's prosperity was due to the Stormy Sea attracting many treasure seekers, but the main reason was the presence of an inter-domain transmission array within the city, connecting the Xiao Jin Yuan Xian domain to the Da Jin Yuan Xian domain, with countless people traveling between the two domains, creating the city's prosperity.

Outside Jin Yuan City, a massive square stood, covering an area of tens of miles, filled with people coming and going, bustling with activity.

Every moment, a beam of light would fly in from the distance, landing on the square, or people would depart from here, flying towards the distance.

A beam of dark green light flew in from the distance, stopping on the square, and a dark green flying boat appeared, with two figures standing on it, Han Li and Lan Yan, who had finally arrived after ten years.

"Not bad, the number one city in the Xiao Jin Yuan Xian domain is indeed impressive." Han Li gazed at the seemingly endless Jin Yuan City, nodding in praise.

"This Jin Yuan City... is still passable, but when Han Li arrives at the Da Jin Yuan Xian domain and goes to the Ji Yuan City, he'll know what a truly great city is." Lan Yan smiled and said.

"Oh, is that so? Then I'm looking forward to it even more." Han Li said indifferently, putting away the dark green flying boat, and flying towards Jin Yuan City.
