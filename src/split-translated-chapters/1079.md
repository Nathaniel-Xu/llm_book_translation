Jiao San instinctively took a step back, only to feel his shoulder being grabbed, and his body was suddenly lifted off the ground and sent flying backward.

The golden ferret that had just bounced back suddenly expanded its body at an alarming rate, and its entire body radiated a brilliant golden light. With a loud "boom," it exploded into a massive golden vortex that swept outward, emitting a deafening roar and containing numerous golden blades that seemed to be slicing through the air.

What was even more astonishing was that these golden blades contained a concentrated golden attribute law, which instantly shredded the surrounding air into fragments.

Han Li tossed Jiao San aside and flashed forward, his body radiating a brilliant starlight as he employed the Five Elements Phantasmal Sect's cultivation technique and the Heavenly Executioner's technique simultaneously. His fist was imbued with a powerful aura, and he struck forward with a mighty blow.

A golden light enveloped his fist, and a semi-transparent golden fist shadow shot out, heavily striking the golden vortex.

A deafening crash echoed through the air!

The golden vortex exploded, releasing countless golden blades that flew outward in all directions.

The air was still reeling from the aftershocks, and the residual aura had yet to dissipate when the young man flew down, charging towards Han Li.

Han Li couldn't help but inwardly sigh.

It seemed that this was indeed a Gold Devouring Immortal, and just like Jin Tong, he was eager to engage in a fierce battle at the slightest provocation.

Han Li faced the Gold Devouring Immortal with utmost caution, his True Speech Treasure Wheel reversing as his body suddenly became blurry and retreated a short distance.

"Time Law?" the young man muttered, his face expressionless, yet a hint of displeasure flickered in his eyes.

As he spoke, a golden ripple spread across his body, and his entire being became illusory, with a series of faint shadows appearing around him.

Han Li felt a sudden blur, and the young man reappeared beside him, his palm extended, fingers curled into claws, grasping for Han Li's throat.

This attack was incredibly swift, and even Han Li found it difficult to dodge.

Just as the young man's fingers were about to touch Han Li's throat, a feminine voice shouted from the side, and a sword light shot from the left, targeting the young man's head.

The young man merely sneered, making no attempt to evade, and continued to grasp for Han Li.

A sharp "zing" sound echoed through the air!

The sword light was incredibly sharp, but when it struck the young man, it merely flashed once before shattering and dissipating, failing to even damage his golden robe.

Just as the young man's fingertips were about to touch Han Li's throat, a golden light burst forth from behind Han Li.

A golden treasure wheel materialized, spinning wildly in the air, emitting dazzling golden light that illuminated the surroundings.

The young man felt time itself being frozen, and his body became suspended in mid-air.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he beckoned with his hand.

A series of "whooshing" sounds echoed through the air as thirty-six blue-green swords, the Qingtian Huayun Swords, materialized beside him, each leaving behind a trail of faint sword marks as they shot towards the young man.

A burst of golden light flashed, and a series of golden lightning bolts erupted from the swords, resembling thirty-six lightning serpents shooting towards the young man from all directions.

The air was filled with a cacophony of clashing sounds as the golden lightning bolts converged, enveloping the young man in a brilliant golden aura.

"Rumble, rumble, rumble..."

The golden aura pulsed with energy, and the air around it seemed to burn with an intense heat.

However, after a prolonged period, the lightning bolts dissipated, and the young man reappeared, his golden robe slightly charred, but otherwise unharmed.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he pinched his fingers, causing the thirty-six swords to merge into a single flying sword.

The sword's surface erupted with a brilliant display of symbols, and a massive golden lightning bolt, as thick as a water jug, descended from the sky, striking the young man with incredible force.

"Rumble, rumble, rumble..."

The sound of the impact shook the heavens, and the young man was engulfed by the golden lightning bolt, his body sinking downward.

The desert seemed to give birth to a lake of golden lightning, its surface churning with incredible energy.

Jiao San and the others, who had retreated to a safe distance, watched this spectacle with changing expressions.
It's really infuriating... people are just so different, it's enough to drive one to death..." Xiong Shan's expression was the most complex, and he couldn't help but sigh.

A moment later, the lightning dissipated, the thunder ceased, and the golden lightning pool disappeared.

Everyone saw that the Qing Zhu Fengyun Sword was stuck in the young man's forehead, but it had only pierced his hair, without harming his flesh.

The strength of a Daluo-level Xian's body was simply unimaginable.

"Heh heh, do you have any other tricks up your sleeve? If not, I'll have to take action..." The young man, who was being restrained by the True Word Treasure Wheel, suddenly spoke up.

As he spoke, his body glowed with golden light, and layers of golden ripples emanated from him, transmitting his own unique law fluctuations, which clashed with the golden light of the True Word Treasure Wheel, actually pushing it back a bit.

Han Li saw this and his eyes flashed with surprise.

Earlier, through the refinement of the "Beehive", he had already condensed a large amount of time law threads, and the time law power within him had far surpassed what it was before. He had thought that although he might not be able to subdue the same time law power as Qimozi, at least he could prevent ordinary Daluo cultivators from moving.

But now, this level of law power was unable to completely restrain this Daluo-level Xian.

The young man's face suddenly lost its smile, and two nearly transparent wings appeared behind him.

 Accompanied by a faint humming sound, his wings began to flutter rapidly, with strands of semi-transparent golden light flashing on their surface, rapidly impacting the golden light of the True Word Treasure Wheel.

As the golden light grew stronger, the law fluctuations emanating from him became more apparent, and the space where the True Word Treasure Wheel was being pushed back grew larger.

In this space, the young man was able to move freely.

He first raised his hand to brush off the scorch marks on his golden robes, then rubbed the spot on his forehead where the sword had pierced, and looked at Han Li with a calm expression, raising one hand and lazily clenching his fist.

However, just this simple action caused a terrifying aura to suddenly erupt from him.

His body was surrounded by a blast of golden light, and behind him, a massive, illusory golden cicada-like creature seemed to appear, releasing law fluctuations that instantly pushed back the golden light.

"Not good, be careful!" Jiao San's heart skipped a beat, and he was about to rush forward to help when Han Li raised his hand to stop him.

Jiao San looked at Han Li in confusion, and saw that he had suddenly withdrawn the True Word Treasure Wheel into his body.

"Han brother, what are you doing?" Huo San's brow furrowed in confusion.

Not just him, but even the young man looked puzzled, a strange expression on his face.

"This Xian friend, how should I address you?" Han Li suddenly asked.

"Han brother, why are you trying to make friends with him now? What's the point?" Huo San asked, his voice laced with amusement.

Jiao San simply shook his head, indicating that he didn't understand either.

The young man heard this and his brow furrowed slightly, but he didn't respond.

Han Li saw this and didn't get angry, continuing to speak: "I observe that you, like the previous layers of the tower, are also being imprisoned by the Taixu Xianzun. So, why must you be enemies with us?"

"Hahaha, hahaha..."

The young man heard this and laughed loudly, as if he had heard a joke.

"If you don't make things difficult for us, I, Han, can promise to find a way to lift the seal and take you out of this prison. What do you think?"

"Ha! You think you can defeat me? You think you can get past the seventh layer? You think you can get out of this tower? I've been trapped here for millions of years, and I've already killed all the other beasts and creatures that were imprisoned here. I've turned their bones into gold dust, and created this golden desert. But I'm not going to let you have this entertainment, I'm not going to let you leave this tower."

Han Li's expression remained calm as he spoke: "If I can convince you, I naturally have a way to deal with the seventh layer. Now, it's just a matter of whether you're willing to cooperate or not."

The young man saw Han Li's confident expression and his eyes flashed with a hint of hesitation.

If he could leave, who wouldn't want to?

But the person in front of him, did he really have the ability to take him out of the tower?

"Alright, I'll agree to your terms... but you have to prove to me that you won't die at the hands of that old lunatic, and that you have the ability to save me from this tower. Why don't you just stand there and take a punch from me?" The young man's eyes gleamed with a hint of challenge.

Jiao San and the others heard this and their brows furrowed in concern, but before they could speak, Han Li calmly said:

"I agree."

"I agree."
