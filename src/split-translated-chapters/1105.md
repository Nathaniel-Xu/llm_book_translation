Han Li's eyes, which had transformed into a giant demon's, suddenly twitched, and he let out a loud roar.

His six fists, which emitted a dark glow, simultaneously burst forth with dazzling starlight, and then condensed into a starlight pattern on his fists before shooting out.

A loud "whooshing" sound filled the air!

Six solid, fist-like shadows shot out, emitting a dark glow and starlight that intertwined and flashed, releasing an explosive power that surpassed the previous black fist shadows, shooting towards the yellow cloud in the air.

At the same time, the two golden blades, which had been transformed from the Time Law Crystal Threads, and the giant electric sword, which had been transformed from the Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword, simultaneously shot out, slashing towards the yellow cloud.

A series of earth-shaking, thunderous sounds echoed through the air!

The six fist shadows struck the yellow cloud first, exploding and opening up into six giant light balls that collided with the yellow cloud, followed by the two golden blades and the giant electric sword, which struck the yellow cloud with great force.

The yellow cloud, which was incredibly resilient, was still violently tumbling and was torn apart with a loud "ripping" sound, revealing the yellow door inside.

Han Li's eyes lit up with excitement as he saw this scene, and he was about to urge the golden blades and the giant electric sword to strike the yellow door.

But at that moment, the yellow door began to shake violently, and a layer of yellow ripples burst forth from it.

The two golden blades and the giant electric sword were struck back, flying back with a loud "boom".

Han Li's body shook, and he retreated two steps before regaining his balance.

At that moment, the yellow door's light burst forth, and it slowly opened a narrow gap.

A loud "boom" echoed through the air as countless yellow rays poured out of the gap, like a river bursting its banks or a sky full of stars falling.

Through the gap, one could see that the inside of the door was a vast, earthy yellow space with endless, rolling waves of yellow light that seemed to be condensed into a liquid state, surging outwards.

Each yellow ray was a pure, unadulterated manifestation of the Earth Law, almost condensing into a liquid state, and they poured out of the gap, forming a massive yellow whirlpool.

The sword-shaped patterns on the yellow door flashed rapidly, and the yellow rays that poured out immediately split apart, transforming into a multitude of earthy yellow stone swords that filled the air, emitting a terrifying, ear-piercing sound.

Each stone sword had the Earth Law patterns etched onto it, emitting a heavy, oppressive aura that made the already heavy space feel even more suffocating.

Han Li's face turned pale as he watched this scene, and he quickly formed a hand seal.

His giant demon body, which had been over a hundred meters tall, suddenly shrunk to a tenth of its original size, becoming around ten meters tall.

The Time Spirit Domain rapidly shrunk, becoming around a hundred meters in diameter, but its power increased several times over.

The two golden blades, which had flown back into the spirit domain, shattered and reformed into a multitude of golden crystal threads that swirled within the domain, increasing its power.

The stone swords that poured down from the sky entered the golden spirit domain, and their speed suddenly decreased.

Han Li took advantage of this brief moment to grab at the air with his six arms.

The giant electric sword, which had flown back, flashed with lightning and transformed into six smaller golden lightning swords, each falling into one of Han Li's hands.

As he moved his arms, they became blurry, and the six lightning swords transformed into a blurry sword shadow that intertwined with the stone swords, forming a sword net that clashed with the stone swords.

The sound of the collision was like thunder, and the stone swords that poured down from the sky were shattered by the golden sword net.

However, Han Li's body also shook violently, and his six arms, which held the swords, felt a dull pain, causing his face to change color.

Each stone sword contained a powerful Earth Law that was almost palpable, and they were incredibly heavy, making Han Li feel like he was being struck by a mountain every time he blocked one.

The sound of the swords clashing grew louder and louder, and more stone swords flew down, increasing the pressure on Han Li.

"Damn it! What kind of sword array is this?!" Han Li cursed in his heart, using all his strength to activate the "Heavenly Execution, Jail Prison" technique, the Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword, and the Time Spirit Domain.

The golden sword net grew denser, stubbornly resisting the stone swords that poured down from the sky.

...

At the same time, over a thousand miles away from the Stone Sword Plaza, two figures flew through the air, their movements swift and agile.

The two figures were Jiao San and Huo San.

"That tortoise-backed demon was incredibly resilient, and I had to use the Later Heaven Seal to suppress it, but it still managed to escape. Its strength is not to be underestimated," Jiao San said, her brow furrowed in concern.

As she spoke, she couldn't help but glance at the dark yellow, square-shaped seal in her hand, which had a ferocious, beast-like image etched onto its surface, and the words "Heaven and Earth" inscribed below it.

The seal itself didn't seem to have any particularly remarkable features, but it emitted a powerful, earthy aura that seemed to pulse with energy, and every now and then, a layer of yellow light would burst forth from its surface.

"You're not a practitioner of the Earth Law, so it's not easy for you to use this seal. Trying to kill that demon, which is known for its physical strength, is even more difficult. But judging from its appearance, it shouldn't be feeling too well," Huo San said with a smile.
Jiao San nodded, about to put away the yellow large seal, when he suddenly frowned, his eyes falling on the stone sword square in front of him, which was getting closer and closer.

At this moment, the square was shrouded in sword energy, and it was impossible to see anything clearly.

"This is..." Huo San also frowned, puzzled.

"This sword array looks extraordinary, it seems to have started operating, could it be that someone has already passed through the array?" Jiao San said, also somewhat surprised.

The two of them had just landed on the edge of the stone sword square, when two more figures appeared in the distance, and Lan Yuanzi and his sister Lan Yan appeared.

Seeing Jiao San and Huo San standing outside the array, Lan Yuanzi's eyebrows twitched slightly.

Lan Yan glanced at the stone sword square, which was shrouded in sword energy, and the magnificent great hall behind it, and his eyebrows also furrowed.

Jiao San and Huo San exchanged glances with them, but no one spoke.

Just then, three more figures appeared, and Lei Yuze, Su Cai, and Wen Zhong arrived.

As soon as Lei Yuze landed, his eyes fell on the sword array that had already started operating.

He took a step forward, walking back and forth on the edge of the square, his eyes shining with excitement.

"The Heaven-Piercing Sword Array... Wen Shidi, do you see? This is the real, complete Heaven-Piercing Sword Array..." Lei Yuze exclaimed, his eyes full of joy.

"Our sect's lost sword array, and it's actually here?" Wen Zhong's eyes widened in surprise.

"I've studied the Heaven-Piercing Sword Array for years, but I've never been able to recreate it completely. I didn't expect that it actually existed here, it seems that the legend of our sect is true, and Taisheng Xianzun really did bring the array diagram here." Lei Yuze said, still unable to contain his excitement.

"Lei Daoyou, what's wrong with you?" Su Cai asked, feeling that Lei Yuze's expression was strange.

Lei Yuze came back to his senses, composed himself, and said with a hint of embarrassment:

"I was just surprised to see the Heaven-Piercing Sword Array, which our sect has lost. I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."

"You're saying that this sword array is the famous Heaven-Piercing Sword Array?" Su Cai asked, also surprised.

Jiao San and the others heard this, and their expressions changed.

The origin of the Heaven-Piercing Sword Array's name was interesting. It wasn't because it came from the Heaven-Piercing Sword Sect, but rather the other way around. The Heaven-Piercing Sword Sect got its name because of this array.

It could be said that the Heaven-Piercing Sword Array was the foundation of the Heaven-Piercing Sword Sect.

Therefore, it was clear that this sword array was extremely important to the Heaven-Piercing Sword Sect.

As the sect's main sword array, its power was naturally extraordinary, and it was said that it could kill enemies with ease, even if they were of a higher level.

"Lei Daoyou, looking at this array's layout, it's clear that someone has already entered the array. I think it's urgent, you should quickly break through the array. If some monster gets in first, it wouldn't be good." Jiao San warned.

Lei Yuze's eyebrows furrowed, and he hesitated for a moment, just as he was about to speak, his face suddenly changed, and he turned to look behind him.

At the same time, Jiao San and the others also changed their expressions, looking in the same direction.

A dark cloud was gathering in the sky, and seven or eight figures were flying towards them, shrouded in black mist.

Most of these figures were extremely ferocious and strange, and were the leaders of the monsters that had escaped from the various altars.

Apart from the Copper Lion Monster, the White Bone Monster, and the Blood Hand Monster, there were two new faces.

One of them was ten feet tall, with a black body, dragon horns on his head, and dragon scales on his body. On his back, he had a huge dark green turtle shell, with intricate symbols etched onto it.

However, on the edge of the turtle shell, there was a three-foot-long crack, with sharp edges, looking like a new wound.

As soon as this monster landed, his eyes fell on Jiao San, with a venomous gaze.

It was clear that the crack on his turtle shell was caused by Jiao San's earlier attack with the earth seal.

The other monster didn't stand out in terms of appearance, but his face was almost identical to that of a human, except for his eyes, which were a deep green, and his nose, which was high and curved like an eagle's beak. His eyebrows were also slanted, giving him a sinister look.

This eagle-nosed monster's eyes fell on Lan Yuanzi and his sister, with a calm expression, but his eyes revealed a hidden killing intent.

When he saw the monster's gaze, Lan Yan didn't back down, and instead sneered, pulling out a green wooden staff from his sleeve, with branches that looked like willow leaves, emitting a strong wood-attribute law wave.

The eagle-nosed monster's eyes narrowed, and his face twitched, clearly wary of the staff.

Jiao San's eyes scanned the five monsters, and finally fell on the other two, who didn't have any monster aura, and were clearly the leaders of the group.

The two of them were none other than Qi Mozhi and Xiong Shan.
