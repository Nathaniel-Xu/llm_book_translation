Seven streams of supreme law flowed from all directions, sweeping towards Gu Yu or Jin, who sat in a wheelchair, his face a little more serious but not panicked.

Just as the seven streams of law were about to overwhelm him, his body emitted a large amount of golden light again.

In the midst of this golden light, Gu Yu or Jin's body was slightly blurred, and he dodged the attacks of the seven people once again, reappearing thousands of miles away.

But as soon as he stabilized his body, the sky above him darkened, and a dark red giant palm, large enough to cover thousands of miles of empty space, emerged and swooped down.

The palm had not yet fallen, but the space below it was already covered in a dark red color.

Below the palm, a huge, six-sided wheel of reincarnation appeared, spinning rapidly and emitting a powerful, invisible force that pressed down on the space below.

In an instant, the space around Gu Yu or Jin became distorted, forming thousands of large and small whirlpools that enveloped him.

Each whirlpool emitted a brilliant light, and within it, a figure flickered and disappeared, releasing an immense, indescribable aura.

However, Gu Yu or Jin did not dodge or avoid, and instead, he created a small, golden space around himself, preventing the whirlpools from approaching him.

The dark red giant palm above him belonged to the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation, whose body had become thinner and more gaunt, his clothes fluttering in the wind.

His face and hands were covered in dark red, sinister-looking markings, and his expression was serious.

"Everyone, I have temporarily trapped Gu Yu or Jin," he said slowly. "Don't be stingy with your laws, the outcome will be decided in this one move!"

As soon as he finished speaking, six figures of different colors appeared from six directions, rushing towards Gu Yu or Jin with six streams of law that were far stronger than before.

People watching from 100,000 miles away were shocked and amazed by the scene, their minds numb.

This was a battle between the strongest in the world, a struggle that had transcended the ordinary and entered the realm of the laws.

At this moment, the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation and the Demon Lord's laws seemed to be able to counter Gu Yu or Jin's, and with the addition of the other Dao Ancestors, it seemed that Gu Yu or Jin was doomed.

"Even if Gu Yu or Jin is strong, he is still just one person," someone said. "The Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation and the Demon Lord's laws can already counter his, and with the other Dao Ancestors, he will not be able to escape today."

"Is the world going to change?"

Gu Yu or Jin ignored the dark red whirlpools and the six figures rushing towards him, and instead, he looked up and muttered to himself, "Finally, the time has come..."

At the same time, the golden palace in the depths of the Heavenly Court, where Gu Yu or Jin had been in seclusion, began to shake violently and suddenly burst open.

Countless colorful balls flew out, disappearing into the void.

The gray sky suddenly lit up with a multitude of colors, each one different, like a thousand rainbows hanging in the air, intertwining and overlapping.

These colors seemed to be arranged in a chaotic pattern, but in reality, they had a hidden order, like a giant chessboard covering the sky.

The colors stretched out into the distance, extending to the horizon, and each one emitted a unique law that intersected and overlapped with the others.

The six figures rushing towards Gu Yu or Jin suddenly froze, and three of them, Yin Cheng, Hei Jin Gang, and the man in the cloak, had their bodies emit three colors of light that shot up towards the sky.

Everything happened in an instant, and in the blink of an eye, it was all over.

A massive, crushing pressure descended from the sky, covering everything.

This seemed to be the power of the Heavenly Dao, and any existence, even the Dao Ancestors, seemed insignificant in comparison.

The space around them became heavy, and everyone's bodies became heavy and immobile.

The laws within their bodies began to fluctuate wildly, responding to the colors in the sky.

The Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation's body also began to shake uncontrollably, his law fluctuating wildly, and he was unable to move.

The dark red giant palm that had been controlling the six wheels of reincarnation suddenly burst open, releasing a massive amount of dark red light that surrounded Gu Yu or Jin.

The thousands of whirlpools that had been surrounding him also dissipated, and the space around him returned to normal.
The Demonic Lord, Li Yuanjiu, Chi Rong, and others, as well as the distant Cangwu True Lord and other Dao Ancestors, were all suddenly unable to move, just like the Lord of the Cycle of Rebirth.

Not only the Lord of the Cycle of Rebirth, but also Chen Ruyan, Yin Ming Daozong, and Bai Yun Daozong, all Dao Ancestors of the Heavenly Court, were also immobilized.

Everyone present struggled with all their might, but the surrounding seal was too powerful, and no matter how hard they tried, they were like ants trying to shake a tree, with no effect.

"This day, I have finally waited for, I have waited for too long..." Guo Huinian said with a sigh, as if he had finally relaxed.

"You have collected all the Law's power, completed the 3000 Dao God Array?" The Lord of the Cycle of Rebirth asked in a deep voice.

"It seems that the Lord only understands the surface of the 3000 Dao God Array, to activate this array, it is not necessary to collect all the Laws, in fact, as long as more than half of the Laws are collected, and the 36 Laws that are the core of the array are collected, it can be activated." Guo Huinian looked at the Lord of the Cycle of Rebirth and said.

"That's why I led the demonic domain and the barbarian domain into the heavenly court, including everything here, it's all your plan, to lure everyone in and capture them all?" The Lord of the Cycle of Rebirth's eyes flashed with realization.

"This is indeed my plan, but the main purpose is not for you, but for them three." Guo Huinian said, looking at Yin Qing, Xie Bi, and the others.

"They? Could it be..." The Lord of the Cycle of Rebirth's eyes widened in shock.

"Even if it's the 36 Laws, it's extremely difficult to collect them all, especially the few Laws that were born in the gray realm. I have been planning for many years, constantly sending people to infiltrate the gray realm, but I have only collected two Laws, and the remaining three have all become Dao Ancestors. I had no choice but to wait for the opportunity to invade the heavenly court, set up a trap, and lure them out. If they didn't come, my array would be impossible to activate." Guo Huinian shook his head and sighed.

"Good, good, good! You are indeed a master of strategy, all our actions are within your calculations, I admire you, I admire you." The Lord of the Cycle of Rebirth's face changed, and he laughed bitterly.

"You are the only one in this world who has the qualifications to make me explain myself, but unfortunately, you won't see the true Heavenly Dao I am about to create." Guo Huinian smiled faintly, raised his hand, and struck out.

"Bang" "Bang" "Bang" "Bang" "Bang"

The Lord of the Cycle of Rebirth, the Demonic Lord, Yin Qing, Hei Jin Gang, and the hooded man, five people's chests flashed with golden light, and a golden arm emerged from each of them, piercing their bodies.

A golden mist rose from the arms, enveloping the five people's bodies.

The five people's bodies rapidly shrunk, and in an instant, they turned into skeletons, exploding with a loud "bang".

The Lord of the Cycle of Rebirth and the Demonic Lord's bodies directly turned into ashes, but Yin Qing and the others turned into three balls of light.

"Lord!"

"Master!"

The demonic domain's Dao Ancestors and the barbarian domain's Bai Ze and others' faces changed, and their eyes filled with despair.

Guo Huinian's face was expressionless, and he snapped his fingers.

The three balls of light from Yin Qing and the others flew into the air, merging into a giant chessboard.

The air flashed with light, and a gray, two black, and three light balls appeared.

"Boom!"

The air was filled with a loud explosion, and countless symbols shot out, covering the entire sky.

The pressure from the sky suddenly increased, and the commotion of the Laws' power within everyone's bodies intensified.

A mournful cry echoed, and the cultivators below trembled, as a thread of light emerged from their bodies, flying towards the sky.

Those threads of light were not just the Laws' power, but also the cultivators' spiritual energy, being absorbed by the 3000 Dao God Array.

Not only the demonic domain and the barbarian domain, but also the gray realm, the heavenly court's cultivators' Laws' power and spiritual energy were all being absorbed, including Bai Yun Daozong and the others.

 Threads of Laws' power emerged from their bodies, flying towards the sky.

Among the crowd, only Guo Huinian was unaffected.

"Your Majesty! What are you doing? You promised to bring us three together to surpass the Heavenly Dao, why are you absorbing our Laws' power?" Bai Yun Daozong and the others' faces changed, and they looked at Guo Huinian in shock.

"Once the 3000 Dao God Array is activated, it will be the beginning of the end of this world, everything belonging to this world will become the past, and I will no longer be able to control it. For the true Heavenly Dao, you three will have to sacrifice yourselves." Guo Huinian said calmly.

Bai Yun Daozong and the others' faces turned pale.

Guo Huinian ignored them, and with a movement of his body, he flew upwards.

"A thousand years of darkness, a single lamp illuminates, you all still look too shallow, unable to transcend the cycle of the Heavenly Dao. If that's the case, then let me recreate the Heavenly Dao, recreate a new world where the strong are not bound by the Heavenly Dao!"

As he spoke, he raised his hand, and a spiral symbol appeared on his forehead, shining with a fiery red light.

Guo Huinian's body rose higher, like a golden sun rising, and he reached the ninth heaven.

With a single hand, he drew a symbol on his forehead, and a spiral symbol appeared, shining with a fiery red light.
