After a few breaths, the group arrived at the front of the valley and stopped.

Below the valley, there were also many fireflies nesting, even more than on the ground, making it difficult to approach.

"I'm grateful that you all chose to stay, but I can only help you this far. The road ahead, you'll have to rely on yourselves," Su Zhan Cai said, retrieving the yellow small banner.

The others, having chosen to stay, naturally had their own methods and didn't rely on the Tian Shui Sect's intentions, nodding in agreement.

"I wish you all good luck."

Su Zhan Cai, as the leader of the Tian Shui Sect's three, began to chant a spell, and their bodies flashed with blue light, transforming into three water-blue light shadows that flew out of the ground and shot towards the valley.

Qing Suo Valley Master flipped his hand and stuck a green talisman on his body, then chanted a spell, and the talisman immediately merged into his body.

Numerous green talismans appeared around him, and his body became semi-transparent, then flew out, closely following the Tian Shui Sect's three.

The burly man's body flashed with yellow light, and a thick layer of earth-yellow stone armor covered his entire body.

As the armor appeared, the man seemed to have truly transformed into a stone statue, without any signs of life.

He didn't fly out of the ground, instead continuing to hide underground, using a divine ability similar to earth evasion, advancing towards the valley.

The remaining seven or eight scattered Golden Immortals seemed to be a familiar small group, and they stood in a circle, with a young man with golden hair waving his hand.

A golden light flew out of his hand, transforming into a golden wooden tablet.

The tablet was over ten feet in size, with a golden beast's head pattern engraved on it, emitting a bright golden light, and within the light, a time law fluctuation rippled.

The seven or eight scattered Golden Immortals placed their hands on the golden tablet, and the tablet's golden light immediately intensified, enveloping the scattered Golden Immortals.

However, the golden tablet quickly rotated, and the giant tablet, along with the scattered Golden Immortals, suddenly disappeared into the void, then transformed into a golden shadow, flying towards the valley's depths.

"This is... the Bao Yang Divine Wood!" Han Li exclaimed, his eyes flashing with surprise.

The Bao Yang Divine Wood was a type of divine wood that contained time law power, and its quantity was extremely rare, unexpected to be encountered here.

Han Li didn't continue to linger, and a golden light flashed on his body, transforming into a faint golden shadow, following the scattered Golden Immortals.

As the group flew out of the ground, although they each used their divine abilities to conceal their aura, the valley's fireflies were too numerous, and it was impossible to avoid them entirely.

The fireflies immediately grabbed onto the group's transformed lights, shadows, and other objects, and simultaneously let out a chorus of chirping sounds.

With a loud "boom", the other fireflies flew out, raining down on the group like raindrops.

These fireflies were truly formidable, and no matter what secret techniques Han Li and the others used, or what forms they transformed into, they were all tightly grabbed by the fireflies, quickly forming a dark red insect ball around each person, rolling and biting, and spewing out flames of time.

Han Li's transformed golden shadow was also grabbed by the numerous insects, and the flames of time rained down on him, his body's protective light circle rapidly weakening.

He immediately raised his hands, and a golden lightning light burst forth from his palms, shooting out golden lightning arcs that formed a thick golden lightning net around him.

A powerful lightning law fluctuation rippled within the net, and the surrounding void trembled.

However, under the fireflies' flames of time, the powerful lightning law fluctuations had no effect, and the golden lightning net rapidly dissipated.

Han Li's face sank, and he raised his hands again.

Two thick golden lightning bolts shot out of his palms, merging into the golden lightning net, which immediately brightened, restoring its original thickness.

Han Li continued to release golden lightning from his palms, maintaining the net, and simultaneously released a time law fluctuation mixed within.

With the time law fluctuation's assistance, the golden lightning net's dissipation speed slowed, barely resisting the flames of time's erosion.

Han Li let out a sigh of relief, not trying to shake off the fireflies, but instead, directly carrying the surrounding insects, he flew towards the valley's depths.

The others did the same, carrying the large insect balls, flying towards the valley's depths, and soon arrived at the front of the black cave.

In a short distance, the insect balls around them had accumulated to over ten feet in size, and under their influence, their speed was greatly reduced.

And within the insect balls, numerous flames of time shot out from all directions, more intense than before, almost forming a sea of flames, engulfing the group and burning fiercely.

Han Li and the others used all their strength to defend against the flames of time, and their internal immortal energy surged out, soon exhausting over half of their energy, but they had already reached the cave's entrance.

Han Li let out a low shout, and his hands flashed with golden lightning, suddenly producing four golden lightning dragons that flashed with dazzling lightning light.

Each dragon was not too large, but emitted a powerful lightning law fluctuation, far surpassing the golden lightning net, and wherever they passed, the void shattered.

Besides the lightning law fluctuation, he also mixed in time law power, just like before.

The four dragons shot out, striking the insect balls around them.

The dragons' "boom" shook the air, and the insect balls...
The scorching golden lightning burst forth, and the surrounding insect balls were torn apart in an instant.

Han Li's figure moved like lightning, and with a "whoosh," he shot out from the scattered insect swarm and entered the black cave.

The walls of the cave also had countless small holes, and although many fireflies flew out of them, they continued to pounce on him.

However, the number of fireflies in the cave was much fewer than outside, and Han Li easily fended them off with a wave of his hand, his body once again covered in a layer of golden lightning net.

Han Li had previously used the "Myriad Silence Technique" and the Time Law to isolate his aura, so the fireflies that attacked him were the fewest, and he was the first to enter the black cave.

However, he did not proceed alone, and instead stopped to look back outside.

A burst of extremely cold air exploded from outside the cave, and the insect balls surrounding the three people from the Tian Shui Sect were frozen into blue ice crystals, which then shattered and fell to the ground.

The blue ice crystals emitted an astonishing cold air and law fluctuations, clearly a special kind of cold ice divine ability, and the fireflies' flames on their bodies were also frozen in place.

However, the fireflies did not die, and the flames on their bodies fluctuated, causing the blue ice crystals to slowly melt.

But the blue ice crystal divine ability was not small, and it would not be completely melted for a while.

The three people from the Tian Shui Sect took advantage of the opportunity to fly out and enter the cave, but they did not immediately proceed deeper, and instead stopped.

"Stone friend, how did you...?" Su Zhongzi saw Han Li already inside the cave, and her face showed surprise.

Jin Liu and another elegant young man also looked surprised.

The fireflies that were originally in the cave sensed Su Zhongzi's aura and flew towards her.

The three of them did not have time to care about Han Li, and they quickly used their abilities to defend themselves.

At the same time, about a hundred meters in front of the cave, another insect ball suddenly expanded and burst open, and a rapidly rotating green dragon vortex column appeared, sweeping away the surrounding fireflies and preventing them from approaching.

The green vortex column seemed to come alive, and it inserted itself into the black cave.

"Whoosh!"

Fu Gu Zhu flew out of the vortex column, and in an instant, he also entered the cave, followed by another insect ball that burst open, revealing a blinding golden light that shot into the cave.

Seven or eight scattered Golden Immortals appeared, their faces pale and their aura weak.

These Golden Immortals had just entered the cave when the entrance was suddenly frozen shut with a thick layer of blue ice crystals.

Su Zhongzi withdrew her hand, and a blue ice sphere the size of a fist hovered above her head, emitting a fierce cold air and law fluctuations.

The fireflies outside saw that everyone had entered the cave, and they suddenly became enraged, emitting high-pitched screams and spewing out flames that attacked the blue ice crystals.

More and more fireflies flew in, forming a dark red rainbow that crashed into the blue ice crystals.

The blue ice crystals shook violently, melting rapidly, and cracks appeared on their surface, as if they were about to collapse.

Su Zhongzi's face changed, and she bit her lip, using her divine ability to send the blue ice sphere flying into the blue ice crystals.

The blue ice crystals immediately emitted a brilliant blue light, and the cracks on their surface began to heal, emitting a cold air that was ten times stronger, and stabilizing the situation.

However, the flames' erosion of the blue ice crystals continued, and they melted rapidly.

Su Zhongzi's eyebrows furrowed, but she had no solution.

At this moment, a figure appeared, and Han Li's shadow loomed before the blue ice crystals, his hand pressed against them.

A dazzling golden light burst forth from his palm, merging with the blue ice crystals.

The blue ice crystals' surface immediately emitted a golden glow, and the rate at which they melted slowed down.

"Time Law power!" Su Zhongzi exclaimed, looking at Han Li in surprise.

The others also looked at Han Li with incredulous gazes.

Han Li's expression remained calm, but he secretly sighed.

He didn't want to reveal his true strength, but the situation was critical, and he couldn't afford to hesitate, or he would also be in trouble.

As for how he possessed the Time Law power, and how he was the first to enter the cave, he naturally wouldn't explain, and let them continue to guess.
