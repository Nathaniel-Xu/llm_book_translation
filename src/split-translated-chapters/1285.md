Here is the translated text:

"This withered tree is a yang wing wood, its exterior appears black as if it had been burned by fire, but in reality, it cultivates a divine flame within, and it is self-sustaining." Guī Wū said.

"Oh, how do we break the soul-locking box?" Han Li asked.

"This item was originally used to prevent my soul from dispersing, to collect and refine my residual soul, but later I spent a great deal of effort to modify it, and turned it into a tool for hiding my soul. Now it is connected to my divine soul, and if it is opened carelessly, I fear that my residual soul will not be able to withstand the stimulation of the yin wind, and will dissipate into nothingness." Guī Wū said with a bitter smile.

"This is easy to handle, Qī Huán, please retrieve the scattered soul sand." Han Li said with a smile.

Qī Huán heard this and with a wave of her hand, the golden sand that was wrapped around the roots of the withered tree flew back, and after a few moments of swirling in her palm, it was absorbed into her body.

"I've been saying I would compensate you, but I never had the chance, today is just the right opportunity." Han Li said with a smile.

Guī Wū was confused, and didn't know who Han Li was talking to.

As a result, a silver light flashed on Han Li's shoulder, and a small silver flame figure jumped out, with a happy smile on its face, it rubbed its hands together, and with a jump, it landed on the black withered tree, and hugged it like an octopus.

"This is..."

Guī Wū sensed the aura of the refined flame bird, and suddenly felt uneasy.

"Don't worry, this is a refined flame, a yang object, the yang wing wood will be greatly nourished by it." Han Li said with a smile.

"Please ask the little one to be careful, and not to harm my corpse..." Guī Wū said, before his body suddenly shrank back into the soul-locking box, and he fell silent.

Han Li saw this and smiled, and then instructed the refined flame bird to be careful, and allowed it to transform into a blazing silver flame, which engulfed the yang wing wood.

The process of engulfing the yang wing wood took over half an hour, and Han Li and the others took the opportunity to cultivate and rest.

Finally, the refined flame bird's flame subsided, and it transformed back into the small silver flame figure, which jumped onto Han Li's shoulder, and without saying a word, it lay down and merged into Han Li's body.

The white sandy beach was empty, except for a black corpse and a black box that had fallen to the ground.

Han Li made a gesture to Qī Huán, and she immediately waved her hand, and the scattered soul sand that she had previously retrieved, flew out again, and enveloped the corpse and the soul-locking box.

"Guī Wū, to be cautious, I apologize." Han Li said with a smile.

"It is fortunate to have an ally like you, who is so cautious." Guī Wū's voice came from the soul-locking box, his tone was calm, and without any resentment.

"Then please guide us." Han Li said, as he casually picked up the corpse and the soul-locking box.

"Of course, of course." Guī Wū replied.

...

Seven days later.

The sky was filled with dark clouds, which pressed down on the heavens, and the air was filled with a foul and decaying smell.

Han Li and his two companions walked through a mountain range, with peaks and rocks rising up, and scattered corpses could be seen everywhere, and when the wind blew, it would stir up a green phosphorescent glow.

As they walked along a high cliff, they saw a deep and bottomless chasm, with mist swirling inside, and a stench of rot and decay.

"Uncle, do you really believe that guy's words? Qī Huán said she didn't detect any soul fluctuations, why are we going to so much trouble to walk this mountain path, can't we just fly over from the cliff?" Jīn Tóng complained.

"The land of the underworld is not something that can be judged by ordinary logic, just because Qī Huán didn't detect anything, doesn't mean it's not there. Besides, Guī Wū had no reason to deceive us." Han Li replied.

"That's right, the path that Guī Wū pointed out has been correct so far, and has allowed us to avoid almost all the ghost cities in the underworld, and has saved us a lot of trouble." Qī Huán said.

As they walked, they saw that the winding path continued for over a thousand feet, before being completely obscured by the thick mist, and nothing could be seen.

"Guī Wū, you said that the ghost python that lives on this cliff, has the strength of a Mahārāja, and can dominate the entire region, why does it still stay here, and not leave?" Han Li asked.

"I don't know the reason, the ghost python's past is also very strange, it's said that it had the potential to become a dragon, but it was struck by seven heavenly tribulations, and was killed, and after death, it still harbored resentment, and continued to cultivate in the underworld, and its strength actually surpassed its strength in life, and it has been living on this cliff, and anyone who flies over, regardless of what they are, will be attacked and killed, but those who walk on the mountain path, will not be attacked, as long as they don't provoke it." Guī Wū's voice came from the cloth bag on Han Li's waist.

"This cliff is always shrouded in dark clouds, and anyone who enters will stir up the clouds, and the scene is similar to the heavenly tribulations, perhaps the ghost python is attacking because of this." Han Li thought for a moment, and said.
As soon as his voice fell, a flash of light appeared in the high clouds, as if someone was passing through.

As the clouds rolled, although there was no thunder, the situation was similar to the descent of heavenly thunder.

"Not good, don't get close to the edge of the cliff, stick to the mountain and hurry..." Guī Wū's voice sounded again.

Han Li and the other two heard this and quickly accelerated, sticking to the mountain as they sped forward.

Just then, a series of muffled thunder-like sounds came from the depths of the cliff, and Han Li felt the entire mountain peak shaking violently.

Next, the dense fog that had been lingering in the depths of the cliff suddenly began to churn, and a massive figure burst forth, rushing towards the dark clouds.

Han Li saw a black "wall" rising from the depths of the cliff, colliding with the clouds and causing the air to become chaotic. On top of the wall, he saw a series of kiln-shaped scales, each several dozen meters in size, frantically rubbing against the cliff and sending up sparks.

When the figure finally disappeared into the clouds, Han Li saw its full appearance: a massive black-scaled snake, over ten thousand meters long, with a single horn on its head and two eyes that shone like lanterns, casting two green beams of light.

"This guy's cultivation has increased again, it's already comparable to the late stage of the Dà Luó realm," Guī Wū exclaimed.

"What, a ghostly creature can cultivate to such an extent?" Jīn Tóng asked in disbelief.

"The Wú Huáng realm has its own secrets, and the Yōu Míng realm is no exception. This creature's age is probably even older than mine. Let's go, before it attacks us, let's hurry and leave," Guī Wū urged.

Han Li and the others didn't stop, and instead accelerated their escape.

After finally crossing the cliff and reaching the other side of the mountain, Han Li couldn't help but turn back and look. He saw a massive black head, as large as a mountain peak, rising from the clouds, its two green eyes fixed on them.

But for some reason, the ghostly snake didn't attack them, and instead let them leave the Lòu Hún Cliff.

"Guī Wū, tell me honestly, what's the relationship between you and this ghostly snake? Why didn't it attack us?" Han Li asked, still feeling uneasy.

"This... I'm not really sure. Although it's in my domain, I've always kept my distance and never interacted with it," Guī Wū replied.

"Alright, if we encounter something like this again, let's take a detour," Han Li said.

"Ah, I said that earlier, but we're not taking a detour to avoid the city, are we?" Guī Wū sighed.

...

A month had passed since then.

In the western edge of the Yán Lóu domain, the mountains had disappeared, replaced by a vast expanse of the Ghost Domain Marsh, covering an area of over a million square miles. The marsh was filled with shallow waters and fog, emitting a putrid smell.

On the eastern edge of the marsh, a long, winding shoreline stretched out, with a small peninsula jutting out into the marsh. On the tip of the peninsula stood a tall, young man, gazing upwards.

The man was Han Li.

Above the marsh, a thick layer of colorful clouds floated, about a thousand meters high, looking breathtakingly beautiful.

"Uncle, what are you looking at? Are you still thinking about that ghostly bride?" Jīn Tóng asked, standing behind Han Li and teasing him.

"Jīn Tóng..." Han Li scowled, rebuking him.

"What's wrong, Uncle? You're not exactly handsome, but the ghostly bride didn't seem to mind. She's a ghostly creature, but she's not ugly, and she's got a crush on you. You're not grateful, and you even killed her with a single sword strike. That's a bit too cruel, don't you think?" Jīn Tóng continued, not afraid of Han Li's scowl.

Tì Hún, standing nearby, didn't respond, but covered her mouth and chuckled.

In reality, the ghostly bride was extremely difficult to deal with, using a mystical technique that created illusions, and even Han Li's spiritual eyes and Tì Hún's soul sense couldn't penetrate it. They were trapped for three days, until Guī Wū pointed out the ghostly bride's true form, and Han Li killed her with a single sword strike. Only Jīn Tóng found the whole experience amusing.

Over the past month, they had encountered many strange and bizarre things, leaving Han Li feeling somewhat astonished at the mysteries of the Yōu Míng realm.
