Jin Yun had finally exhausted his strength, and his body quickly dispersed, disappearing completely, leaving the sky clear once again.

The dark gold mountain peak in mid-air suddenly shrank rapidly, and with a boundless aura, it fell towards the ground.

Just as it was about to land, the nearby void began to fluctuate, and a burst of white light appeared, followed by countless white threads that seemed to materialize out of thin air, entwining the dark gold mountain peak.

The mountain peak's descent was halted, and it was completely immobilized by the white threads.

At the same time, the void fluctuated again, and a massive white claw materialized, reaching down towards the ground.

The space around the claw began to collapse, forming a massive black hole that seemed to be a giant mouth, ready to swallow the dark gold mountain peak whole.

Suddenly, the dark gold mountain peak began to shake violently, and its surface glowed with a brilliant golden light. A series of sharp, sword-like beams of light shot out from the mountain peak, cutting through the white threads and the white claw.

The sword beams passed through the void, causing it to tremble, but the white threads were incredibly resilient and could not be cut. The white claw, too, was unaffected, and it seemed to be absorbing the sword beams into its black hole.

Just as the dark gold mountain peak was about to be engulfed by the white claw, a sudden change occurred.

A brilliant golden flame shot out from the lower mountain, rapidly growing into a massive golden dragon that emitted a thunderous roar. In an instant, it flew towards the dark gold mountain peak.

The golden dragon's massive body coiled around the mountain peak, enveloping the white threads. The threads flashed with white light, but soon they were covered by the golden flames, and they began to break apart and burn.

The next moment, the golden dragon's head lifted, and it transformed into a golden shadow that slammed into the white claw.

With a loud "crack," the white claw shattered, and the golden dragon's flames engulfed the surrounding void, forming a sea of golden fire.

The flames seemed to be melting the void, and a figure stumbled out of the flames, flying towards the distance. It was the white-haired youth.

His clothes were torn, and half of his body was burned, but he didn't seem to be seriously injured. His white hair was also badly burned, but he looked more disheveled than anything.

At the same time, a figure emerged from the lower mountain, wearing a wide robe and large sleeves. It was Han Li.

He raised his hand, and the Metal-Elemental Mountain flew back to him, shrinking rapidly as it entered his sleeve.

Han Li had previously entered the Ming Han Palace and obtained the Golden Elixir, which had the power to resist the Elixir Tribulation. He had also collected the fragments of the palace's roof, which had been imbued with the power of the Metal-Elemental Mountain.

The white-haired youth was enraged, and his body glowed with white light. His forehead displayed a series of white patterns that seemed to form a "king" character.

His burned skin began to heal rapidly, and his hands transformed into sharp, snow-white claws. His back also grew a pair of wide, white wings, and his entire body transformed into a half-human, half-beast shape.

A massive aura burst forth from the white-haired youth, causing the air to distort and creating a massive whirlwind that affected the surrounding area.

Han Li was caught off guard by the whirlwind and stumbled backward, unable to stand firm.

Just as the white-haired youth was about to attack Han Li, a golden light flashed, and a golden lamp appeared, blocking the attack.

Han Li had also turned around, and with a swift motion, he released a wave of golden flames that engulfed the white-haired youth.

The white-haired youth had previously experienced the power of the ages, and he didn't dare to let the flames get close. He released a burst of white light, barely managing to stop the flames.

He was shocked and enraged, realizing that his opponent was not as weak as he seemed, thanks to the power of the golden lamp.

"You don't know who I am? You dare to hurt me? I'll make you pay with your life!" the white-haired youth shouted, his eyes blazing with fury.
The white-haired youth was shocked that his opponent could keep up with his attack speed.

It was known that the white-haired youth had the Bloodline of the Ancient, which excelled in speed, and there were few tribes in the entire Savage Domain that could match him in this aspect.

Moreover, the white-haired youth's cultivation had reached the Great Luo Realm, and he was usually able to kill his enemies with a single strike, even against opponents of the same realm. His speed was always a major advantage, but now he was being matched by a human cultivator.

The white-haired youth's body moved, and he was about to retreat, creating some distance between himself and the golden flames.

A wave of golden ripples spread out from the golden flames, instantly enveloping the surrounding area of a thousand meters, and the white-haired youth was caught in the midst of it.

The white-haired youth's body hesitated, and he was enveloped by a powerful temporal law, rendering him unable to move. His heart was shocked, and he was about to use all his strength to shake off the golden ripples.

Suddenly, a golden dragon shot out from the flames, striking the white-haired youth with great force, and then transformed into a golden sun, engulfing his body. The sun then exploded with a loud bang.

A powerful blast of law energy tore apart the surrounding void, and the white-haired youth's body was torn into several pieces.

"Ahh!" The white-haired youth's body was torn apart, but he did not fall. He let out a furious roar, and a brilliant white light shot out from his body, taking the form of a white ship-type artifact.

The ship's hull was inscribed with countless Savage Domain texts, and it had a picture of a multitude of beasts gathered in worship. A massive law energy burst forth from the ship, rivaling the power of the White Flame Bird's white fire bead. The ship enveloped the white-haired youth's body and shot forward.

With a loud "ripping" sound, the golden ripples of the True Word Treasure Wheel were torn apart, and the white ship transformed into a white phantom, disappearing into the distance.

"I'll remember you, cultivator of the Immortal Realm!" The white-haired youth's angry voice echoed through the distance.

Han Li watched the scene unfold, his face calm, but he did not attempt to chase after the white-haired youth.

The white ship's speed was too fast, and Han Li knew he could not catch up.

Han Li had defeated a Great Luo cultivator with ease, but he did not show any signs of pride or arrogance. Instead, he summoned the Years of Life Lamp and gently stroked it.

The white-haired youth was a Great Luo cultivator, but his realm was not stable, and he had dared to engage in close combat with Han Li, which was a recipe for defeat.

Just then, a dark cloud appeared in the distance, filled with various demonic beasts, which let out strange cries as they charged towards Han Li.

But the dark cloud had barely approached when the demonic beasts saw the white-haired youth being severely injured and fleeing, and their cries of excitement instantly ceased.

Han Li turned to look at the dark cloud, and the demonic beasts' faces changed. The dark cloud churned violently, and then suddenly turned and chased after the white-haired youth.

Han Li raised an eyebrow, but he did not pursue the demonic beasts.

Although he had defeated the white-haired youth with the help of the Years of Life Lamp, he had expended a great deal of energy, and his body's spiritual energy was now only half full. He did not want to get involved in any more trouble, and it was better to prioritize his own safety.

He took out a recovery-type pill and swallowed it, and then his body flashed as he transformed into a streak of light, chasing after the Silver Horned Rhinoceros and Cloud Patterned Tiger tribes' caravans.

The White Flame Bird was with the caravan, and Han Li did not need to worry about finding the way.

About half a month later, Han Li caught up with the caravan and returned to his residence without a sound.

He asked the White Flame Bird about the caravan's journey, and learned that they had not encountered any major dangers during this time. He nodded, and then entered the Flowering Branch Space once again.

Han Li took out the Wheel of Reincarnation mask and put it on, attempting to contact Ape Three.

A moment later, a dark red light flashed in the distance, and Ape Three's figure appeared.

"Brother Dragon Five, you're contacting me so urgently. Have you obtained the results?" Ape Three's eyes were cold, but there was a hint of hope in them.

Han Li did not speak, and instead took out a jade box and opened it. Inside the box were five golden pills the size of dragon's eyes.

A wave of golden light burst forth from the pills, and each one had three golden lines etched onto its surface, emitting a profound and mysterious law energy.

"Dao Pills?" Ape Three's eyes lit up, and he exclaimed.

Han Li smiled faintly, and the air seemed to vibrate with the power of the pills.

To refine these five Dao Pills, Han Li had used all his alchemy techniques and auxiliary divine abilities, and had finally succeeded in completing the task.
