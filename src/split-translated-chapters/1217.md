Han Li swept his gaze across, only to see that the iron tower giant had a rugged face, thick eyebrows, and a robust physique, exuding an aura of immense power. He was clearly a middle-stage Da Luo cultivator.

Although the other party's words seemed to convey a sense of familiarity, Han Li didn't recognize him. However, after a few moments of contemplation, Han Li grasped the situation and pretended to be familiar with him, greeting him with a smile: "Zhou Daoist, it's been a long time since we last met..."

As they approached each other, they exchanged a brief glance before engaging in a polite conversation.

The old man with the long white beard, who had been watching from the side, slightly narrowed his eyes and breathed a sigh of relief. Fortunately, he hadn't caused any trouble for this person, and it seemed that he was indeed an acquaintance of his sect's master.

Zhou Xianyang and Han Li walked together, chatting and laughing, until they reached the inner courtyard of the mansion.

"Zhu Lao, please prepare a banquet for today. I want to use the 'Qing Lan Jade Dew' that's been stored for ten thousand years to welcome our old friend," Zhou Xianyang said with a smile, addressing the old man.

"Understood," the old man replied, nodding.

After the old man left, Zhou Xianyang led Han Li into the house, and with a wave of his hand, a silver light door appeared.

Without saying a word, they stepped through the door and entered a secret room.

"The Zhu Lao you saw earlier is a spy planted by the Jin Yuan Xian Palace. I had to put on a show of being old friends to avoid arousing suspicion," Zhou Xianyang said, bowing his fist.

"It seems that being a mole isn't easy," Han Li chuckled.

"Ha! Fortunately, Zhu Lao is a bit cautious, but not clever enough. These years have been relatively peaceful. Now that something big is happening, I'm already prepared," Zhou Xianyang said in a low voice.

"Earlier, Jiao San Daoist didn't tell me much about the situation. He just said that once I arrived, I should follow your arrangements," Han Li said, bowing his fist.

"You're being polite, Han Daoist. Jiao San Daoist told me that I should follow your lead and provide you with all the necessary assistance," Zhou Xianyang said with a smile.

"I'm not being polite. I don't know much about this task, so I'll have to trouble you to explain the details," Han Li said, his eyes narrowing slightly.

"The Tian Ting's Bodhi banquet is a rare event that happens only once every five million years. It's an opportunity for the entire Xian realm to gather and share the Bodhi fruit. However, in the past, only those who received an invitation were qualified to attend. This time, it's different, as they're only providing a quota without restricting the participants," Zhou Xianyang explained.

"Ah, it wasn't like that before... What's the reason behind this arrangement?" Han Li asked.

"I'm not sure, but for the Wheel of Reincarnation, it's not a bad thing. This time, the Jin Yuan Xian Domain has a quota of one hundred spots, with nine of them going to the Ji Yuan Guan and Bai Zao Shan, and the remaining twelve going to the other sects. We need to compete for one of those spots," Zhou Xianyang said, shaking his head.

"Who are the other sects participating, and what's their strength?" Han Li asked.

"The Ri Yue Alliance has already taken control of most of the medium and small sects in the Jin Yuan Xian Domain. They're responsible for allocating their own quota. As for the remaining twelve spots, they're being contested by the other medium-sized sects that aren't part of the Ri Yue Alliance. Although the competition is reduced, there are still ninety-six sects participating," Zhou Xianyang said.

"From ninety-six sects, only twelve spots are available. If things go smoothly, it'll take three rounds of competition to win. And since the Bodhi banquet is so prestigious, I reckon each sect will send their strongest cultivators to participate," Han Li said, his brow furrowing.

"That's correct. However, we can be relieved that the sect masters and elders usually don't participate in the competition. But we can't rule out the possibility that some sect masters might participate personally, despite their status," Zhou Xianyang said, nodding.

"Since you're saying that, I suppose you think someone might actually do that?" Han Li asked, smiling.

"Yes, I'm thinking of our sect's arch-nemesis, the master of the Gu Yang Peak, Si Kong Jian. He's a cunning and ruthless person who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. He even killed one of our sect's talented disciples to avenge his own son. Since then, he's been hiding in the Gu Yang Peak, and we've been unable to catch him," Zhou Xianyang said, his voice filled with hatred.

"What's his cultivation level and strength?" Han Li asked.

"Si Kong Jian was at the early stage of the Da Luo realm, but he's been in seclusion for years. I'm not sure if he's successfully broken through to the middle stage. However, even in his early stage, his strength was half a level higher than his peers. We can't underestimate him. Ideally, we'd prefer not to encounter him at all," Zhou Xianyang said, his expression serious.

"Since it's a random draw, we can't avoid him. I'd like you to prepare a detailed report on him. If we do encounter him, I'll be prepared. Are there any other people we should be aware of?" Han Li asked.

"There's Luo Yuanshan from the Qing Hui Lin, Zhao Bolao from the Wu Ji Shan, and Zi Luoxianzi from the Tian You Hu... These people have considerable strength and might represent their sects. I'll prepare a report on them for you as well," Zhou Xianyang said, listing several names.

"That's great," Han Li said, smiling.
Zhou Xianyang expressed some concern, "This time, Fellow Han's participation in the selection requires borrowing my junior brother's identity, Chang Qi. He has been wandering outside for years, and not many people in the sect have seen his face, so it's not a problem to deceive others. However, my junior brother is a Xuan repair cultivator, and he hasn't practiced many of our sect's techniques. He only relies on his physical Xuan repair skills to reach the Taiyi later stage. Fellow Han, if you participate in the selection with his identity, many of the immortal family's techniques might not be usable."

Han Li smiled, "Xuan repair? Ah, that's exactly what I need." He thought to himself, "I understand why Jiao San wanted me to come here."

Zhou Xianyang's eyebrows rose in surprise, "Could it be that Fellow Han is also a Xuan repair cultivator?"

Han Li's heart stirred slightly, and he secretly activated the Tian Sha Zhen Yu Gong. His body suddenly emitted a powerful aura, and over 900 Xuan apertures lit up, illuminating the entire secret room.

Zhou Xianyang's expression changed, and he muttered, "I didn't expect Fellow Han's Xuan repair skills to have reached such a level. My junior brother can't even compare to you."

He didn't know that Han Li had only revealed a portion of his Xuan apertures, not wanting to scare him.

Han Li smiled, "I'm afraid I've disappointed you, Sect Master Zhou."

Zhou Xianyang's expression relaxed, and he said, "In that case, there's no need to worry. Chang Qi, come out."

Han Li looked towards the inner hall and saw a slender, weak-looking young man emerge from the shadows. He was dressed in a green robe and looked like a refined scholar, not at all like a Xuan repair cultivator.

The young man bowed, "Greetings, Senior Brother, Fellow Han."

Han Li returned the bow, "Fellow Daoist's Xuan repair skills are quite impressive, almost reaching the level of returning to the truth and storing energy in the bones."

The young man, Chang Qi, looked at Han Li with shining eyes, "Fellow Han can see through my foundation. I'm afraid I still have much to learn."

Han Li smiled, "Fellow Chang is too modest."

Zhou Xianyang asked, "Fellow Han, there's still over a month before the Bodhi Feast selection. In this month, you need to familiarize yourself with my junior brother's techniques as much as possible. Although you can't perfect it, at least try to make it convincing. Also, do you know how to use the Luan Huan Hall's mask?"

Han Li nodded, "Jiao San has already taught me."

Zhou Xianyang said, "Then let's begin. Fellow Han, you can start now."

Han Li and Chang Qi exchanged a glance, and the latter nodded slightly.

Han Li apologized, "I'm sorry..."

He then activated a hand seal, and his face began to blur. The black mask on his face appeared, and the symbols on it lit up, emitting a thick, black fog that enveloped his body.

The fog condensed into a line, like a living creature, and slid down to Chang Qi's feet.

Chang Qi stood still, his face tense, as the black fog surrounded him.

Han Li and Chang Qi stood facing each other, with the fog creating a bridge between them. Their faces were indistinct, but it was clear that Chang Qi's aura was being drawn into the fog, towards Han Li.

Zhou Xianyang watched from the side, his eyes shining with expectation.

After about half a quarter of an hour, the fog surrounding Chang Qi began to dissipate, and the black line on the ground retreated, returning to Han Li's body.

Han Li's body began to shrink, becoming the same height as Chang Qi.

The fog then reversed its flow, returning to the black mask, which absorbed it all. The mask emitted a dark glow, and when it faded, a new face appeared on Han Li's body, identical to Chang Qi's.

Zhou Xianyang's eyes widened, and he inspected the two "Chang Qi"s, but he couldn't tell them apart. The real Chang Qi, having lost some of his spiritual energy, looked more like an imposter than Han Li.
