At this moment, the two demons trapped in the knife array saw the situation outside, although they didn't know what was happening, they knew that reinforcements had arrived, and their spirits were immediately lifted, and they began to counterattack.

The tall demon's hands flashed with silver light, and a silver-white pipa appeared, with ten fingers plucking the strings.

In a series of "hissing" sounds, more than a dozen long, black spatial fissures appeared around him, like a dozen black pythons, swiftly cutting towards the damaged area of the knife array.

A loud "ripping" sound echoed, and the knife array was torn apart once again, leaving only a thin layer.

"What is this?" Han Li's eyes widened in shock.

The black-robed woman also immediately took action, waving her hands.

Two purple spheres shot out from her sleeves, rapidly growing larger, and in an instant, they transformed into two purple puppets, with purple lightning wrapped around them.

The aura emitted by the puppets was no weaker than the black-robed woman's, and the purple lightning contained an explosive power that was beyond ordinary lightning techniques.

The black-robed woman's hands opened, and ten black threads shot out, entering the bodies of the two puppets, with a strange power emanating from them.

The purple lightning on the surface of the puppets suddenly intensified, and their aura surged, transforming into two massive purple lightning balls, which then exploded.

Two purple suns appeared, fiercely impacting the knife array, and the surrounding space was directly torn apart.

The knife array was unable to withstand the attack, and a large hole was torn open.

"Let's go!"

The tall demon pulled the person beside him, and they transformed into a silver light, shooting into the sky and instantly flying out of the hole in the knife array.

Han Li's face revealed a smile, and he floated towards them.

"Friend, who are you?" The two demons flew out of the encirclement, and their hearts relaxed, but when they saw Han Li approach, they immediately became vigilant again.

Han Li, in order to prevent being recognized as a human cultivator by the ghosts of the underworld, used the wheel of reincarnation mask to transform into a long-robed figure, looking mysterious and ghostly.

Jin Tong and Qi Hun flew back, and the goat-headed ghosts also angrily charged towards the group, with a determined look on their faces.

"This is not a place for conversation, let's leave first." Han Li raised his hand and waved.

Five massive golden lightning bolts shot out from his hand, and the space around them violently shook, as if it was about to be torn apart by the lightning.

Han Li was slightly surprised, as his power had increased greatly, and the might of the divine lightning was now even more astonishing.

The five lightning bolts fell near the group, and as they intersected, they formed a new lightning array.

But at this moment, the black-robed woman's five fingers opened, and five black threads shot out, entering the lightning array.

The lightning array, which was about to take shape, suddenly stopped, as if it was being controlled.

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise.

"Where are you taking us?" the black-robed woman asked, her voice stern.

The tall demon beside her did not stop her companion's actions.

The lightning array seemed to have a transmission effect, and although the group had helped them escape, they couldn't just let them take them away.

As for the goat-headed ghosts flying towards them, the tall demon didn't put them in his heart, as they had been trapped by accident, and now that they had escaped, they could leave at any time.

Han Li's surprise only lasted for a moment, and then his expression returned to normal. His five fingers moved, and the golden lightning bolts shot out, growing thicker and more massive.

The black-robed woman's fingers shot out, and the black threads shattered, as the five lightning bolts rapidly intersected, forming a lightning array.

The goat-headed ghosts flew towards the group, and a series of black misty blades cut down, tearing apart everything.

A dazzling golden lightning bolt suddenly burst forth, illuminating the surrounding space, and the figures of the group inside the array flickered, before disappearing without a trace, leaving the blades to cut through empty air.

The goat-headed ghosts angrily charged towards the location of the golden lightning array, continuing to slash and hack.

"Enough, stop!" A loud voice echoed, and a tall figure flew out from the goat-headed ghosts.

This was a tall and imposing commercial sheep ghost, taller than ordinary commercial sheep ghosts, with two curved horns on its head, and a long beard on its chin, looking very majestic, and seeming to be a leader.

The angry ghosts stopped, looking at the figure.

"Leader, those two outsiders escaped, should we pursue them?" Another tall commercial sheep ghost stepped forward, asking.

"Can you catch up? And those outsiders are very strong, we only managed to trap them with our battle array. What's the point of sending a few people to chase after them? Are you looking to send them to their deaths?" The commercial sheep ghost leader sneered, saying.

The commercial sheep ghost who had been scolded looked embarrassed, and replied, "Yes, yes, we won't pursue them."

"Let's go back, and inform the horse king tribe about the invasion of the outsiders." The commercial sheep ghost leader said, after a moment of silence.

The ghost behind him replied, "Yes, yes," and the ghosts in the valley turned into black shadows, flying towards the distance.

...

Hundreds of millions of miles away, in a black forest, a golden lightning bolt suddenly appeared in the sky, rapidly growing larger, and transforming into a lightning array.
The light in the center of the lightning array flickered, and the figures of Han Li and the others suddenly appeared.

However, the golden lightning array did not dissipate, but instead shone brightly again, continuing to transmit them.

After several consecutive transmissions, the group stopped in a dark red desert, and the lightning array finally dissipated.

"Who are you?" two demonic cultivators immediately retreated, their voices low and menacing.

"It's me," Han Li looked at the two of them, and with a flick of his wrist, he activated the Wheel of Rebirth mask, revealing his true appearance.

"Brother Han, it's you!"

The tall demonic cultivator was overjoyed, and with a swipe of his hand, he removed his hood, revealing a familiar face - it was Shi Chuan Kong.

His physique was much larger than before, and his body had become more robust, emitting a powerful aura. It was clear that he had made significant progress in his physical cultivation.

"Brother Shi, I didn't expect that after parting ways in the demon realm, we would meet again in this desolate place."

Han Li nodded slightly at Shi Chuan Kong, then turned to look at the black-robed woman, a hint of tender emotion flashing in his eyes. He spoke softly:

"Ling, I didn't expect to see you again."

"Brother Han, how did you end up here?" the black-robed woman stared at Han Li, her face pale, her chest rising and falling slightly. She slowly removed her hood, revealing a stunningly beautiful face.

It was none other than Zi Ling.

However, at this moment, she seemed to have just gone through a fierce battle, her face pale, her chest heaving slightly. In the dim light of the desolate land, she looked even more beautiful and alluring.

This scene caught Han Li's attention, and his heart skipped a beat. Many memories and complex emotions welled up in his mind, but he forcibly suppressed them.

Jin Tong and Qi Hu also changed their appearances, and seeing that Han Li was no longer hiding, they too revealed their true forms.

Zi Ling saw Jin Tong and Qi Hu, and her eyebrows furrowed slightly, as if she wanted to ask something, but didn't say anything.

"They are Jin Tong and Qi Hu, my former spirit beasts, who have now transformed into human form," Han Li explained.

Zi Ling heard this and her expression changed, a smile spreading across her face. Her eyes sparkled with curiosity.

Han Li had told her about Jin Tong and Qi Hu before, and they had even met in the mortal realm. They had gone through many experiences together, but at that time, Jin Tong and Qi Hu had not yet awakened their spiritual intelligence.

Who would have thought that after so many years, the two spirit beasts had undergone such a great transformation?

Jin Tong simply nodded at Zi Ling, without speaking, while Qi Hu spoke in a friendly tone:

"Zi Ling, I heard from my master that we met in the demon realm, but I was severely injured and unconscious in the Flower Branch Space, and didn't have the chance to meet you. Please don't blame me."

"It's not a problem, and thank you for helping me and Brother Shi escape earlier," Zi Ling bowed to them, expressing her gratitude.

"You're not outsiders, so there's no need to be so polite," Qi Hu smiled.

Zi Ling's face flushed, and her heart felt a surge of sweetness. She felt a strong affection for Qi Hu.

"Hmph, Brother Han, you're surrounded by beautiful women, it's truly enviable," Shi Chuan Kong patted Han Li's shoulder, teasing him.

"Stop talking nonsense, Jin Tong and Qi Hu are just my companions. By the way, you two haven't told me why you're here," Han Li asked, turning the conversation.

Shi Chuan Kong's expression turned hesitant, and he didn't speak for a moment.

"If it's a secret, then let's just forget I asked," Han Li said, raising his hand.

Actually, after seeing Shi Chuan Kong and Zi Ling, Han Li couldn't help but think of Xi Dao Ren and what had happened in the demon realm. But in this situation, it didn't seem like the right time to ask.

"Thank you, Brother Han, for understanding," Shi Chuan Kong said, relieved.

Zi Ling glanced at Shi Chuan Kong, wanting to say something, but ultimately didn't speak.

Shi Chuan Kong looked at Han Li and the others, wanting to ask about their purpose, but since he couldn't be open, he didn't dare ask.

To avoid an awkward silence, he looked around and asked:

"What is this place?"

"Judging from the terrain, it should be a place called the Prison Fire Desert. The climate is relatively hot, and most ghostly creatures don't want to approach. There aren't any strong tribes living here, so it's relatively safe. You two seem to have just gone through a fierce battle, do you need to rest?" Han Li asked.

"I'm a bit tired, but I want to rest for a bit," Zi Ling said, before Shi Chuan Kong could speak. She had been struggling to hold on earlier, and now that she saw Han Li and the others, she felt a sense of relief wash over her.

"Then let's rest for a bit," Shi Chuan Kong nodded, and with a wave of his sleeve, hundreds of dark lights flew out, landing on the ground nearby. They formed a black light screen, covering an area of several hundred meters.

Zi Ling and Shi Chuan Kong sat down, cross-legged, and took out their magic stones to recover their magic energy.

Jin Tong also sat down, closing his eyes to meditate.

Han Li and Qi Hu stood guard, one on each side, protecting Zi Ling and the others.

As they rested, the atmosphere was quiet, with only the occasional sound of the wind rustling through the desert sands.
