Jiao San gazed at the Hall of Reincarnation's master, knowing that he was her father, and her heart was filled with a mix of emotions.

After all these years, she had finally found the answers to all her questions. She understood why the master had been so devoted to teaching her, why she had been able to receive the Hall's resources and assistance, and why she had been able to cultivate without any obstacles.

It turned out that she wasn't an orphan without a father or mother. She had a family, a place to call home, and her father's love had always been with her.

As she thought about this, Jiao San's eyes reddened, and tears wet her cheeks.

Han Li saw this and was slightly moved.

The master's own daughter was by his side, yet they couldn't acknowledge each other. Ten years might not be a long time, but over a thousand years, it was a pain that couldn't be put into words.

"As for you and Ruxue, it's the same. I didn't dare to contact you too much, fearing that Gu or Chen would find out and harm you," the master said to Han Li.

Han Li, who had already believed the master's words, couldn't help but ask, "Why did you reveal everything now? Why did you force Ruxue's memories into Wan'er's mind?"

The master's eyes flashed with a fierce light. "Times have changed. I no longer need to hide. I believe that after this, you'll see my strength, and after clearing out the hidden dangers in the Hall, I'll take revenge on Gu or Chen. You're not one to act without a reason, so you'll probably make up your mind to work with me after seeing the Hall's methods."

Han Li's eyes flashed with anger. "You want to join forces to defeat a common enemy? You shouldn't have involved Wan'er!"

The master's expression changed, and he angrily said, "She's my wife, the mother of Jiu Zhen. When I destroy Gu or Chen and the Heavenly Court, I want her to see it, to know that my sacrifices weren't in vain, that I didn't betray her."

"She's Nangong Wan, not Gan Ruxue. She's the only Nangong Wan," Han Li said, his eyes blazing with anger.

The master coldly retorted, "What right do you have to argue with me? In all these years, my heart has only thought of Gan Ruxue, never forgetting her for a moment. You, on the other hand, have Zi Ling by your side. What is Nangong Wan to you?"

Han Li's face twisted in a bitter smile, and he was speechless.

The master's expression softened slightly. "She's only gained Ruxue's memories, but her own memories are still intact. Once she sees me defeat Gu or Chen, I can remove her memories of Ruxue."

Han Li said, "With the memories of two lifetimes, what kind of pain will she endure? The choice to become Gan Ruxue or return to being Nangong Wan shouldn't be made by you or me, but by her herself."

The master nodded. "The calculations of the Tianyi Sect are no trivial matter. You and I, having lived two lives, have disrupted the heavenly mechanism. You can temporarily evade detection, but once you reach the Da Luo Ding Peak, you won't be able to hide. If Gu or Chen finds you, you'll be doomed. You must decide whether to live a life of hiding or to join me in reversing the heavens."

Han Li was silent for a long time before speaking. "With my current strength, it's hard to participate in your struggle against the Time Ancestor. I might not even reach the Da Luo Peak before I fall."

Jiao San saw this and opened her mouth to persuade Han Li, but the master stopped her.

"You and I have different experiences, but our hardships are similar. Even our personalities are similar. When my younger sister got married, I returned to the village, but I didn't reveal myself. At that time, I thought I had severed all ties with my past life and was a cultivator focused on the path."

Han Li listened to the master's words, and his eyes became distant. He had also returned to the village, seeing his younger sister get married, and had the same determination to cultivate.

The master's face became blurry, and Han Li realized that they were supposed to be the same person, but due to the time laws and the butterfly effect, they had become two different people. Yet, something in the depths of their hearts still guided them to cultivate the time laws.

Han Li didn't know how to view their relationship.

"I know it's hard for you to accept my existence, but I've lived through your life. I know what your future holds, and with my existence, your future might have more variables. You know the ending of Mi Luo; I advised him to join the Hall, but he refused, thinking he could hide and be safe... In other words, helping me is helping yourself."

Han Li's heart was tumultuous, and he was silent for a long time before speaking. "I need some time to think things through."

The master nodded. "I won't say more. Let's wait for Ruxue to wake up and see what she chooses. If she wants to follow you, I won't force her to stay. But can you protect her now?"

Han Li shook his head. "No need to wait. Wan'er has already been involved due to your actions. Even if I keep her by my side, I fear I won't be able to protect her. She might be safer with you."

The master hesitated for a moment before nodding. "Very well."

Han Li looked at Nangong Wan, who was still frowning, and saw a hint of reluctance in her eyes. He turned and walked towards the exit.

The master spoke up. "You came here to use the Six Paths Reincarnation Disk. Why not use it before you leave?"

Han Li stopped and turned back. "Nine Zhen, take your mother and leave first."

Jiao San looked at the master and Han Li with a complex expression. "Yes, Father."

She picked up Nangong Wan and walked towards the inner hall, leaving Han Li and the master behind.
The master of the Wheel of Rebirth's eyes flashed with a hint of joy, but it was quickly hidden, and with a wave of his hand, the dark red spiritual domain was retracted.

"Bring them in," he said.

Han Li didn't say much, and immediately sent a message to Qiuhun and Ziling.

When Ziling and the others appeared in the grand hall, the "Han Li" who had transcended time and the Wheel of Rebirth had already put on his hat and concealed his aura, once again becoming the enigmatic master of the Wheel of Rebirth.

"Let's go," the master of the Wheel of Rebirth said indifferently, turning around and walking towards the back hall.

Han Li nodded to the others, not explaining what had happened in the hall, and gestured for them to follow.

Ziling saw that Han Li's face was somewhat serious, and her heart was filled with concern. She walked closer to him, following behind him. Qiuhun also sensed that something was off, but didn't ask any questions.

Jintong called out "Uncle", but when Han Li didn't respond, he looked puzzled and followed along.

Shichen looked deeply at the master of the Wheel of Rebirth's back, feeling like he had seen him before, but couldn't quite remember where.

Everyone followed the master of the Wheel of Rebirth through the dark passageway behind the hall, descending to the open underground space.

When they arrived at the stone platform in the center, they saw the massive Wheel of Rebirth suspended in mid-air, and the dark red water pool below.

"The Six Paths Wheel of Rebirth is a treasure that involves the laws of the Wheel of Rebirth. Using it not only consumes the laws of the Wheel of Rebirth, but also relates to the user's fate. Not everyone can benefit from it. If you become immersed in it and your past karma is unclear, you may even be burdened by the Wheel of Rebirth, and your cultivation may not increase, but instead regress. You must consider carefully whether or not to use it," the master of the Wheel of Rebirth said.

Ziling and the others heard his words and furrowed their brows, their faces showing hesitation. Jintong, however, looked delighted.

"Past events are all in the past, I don't want to be burdened by them. I won't use the Six Paths Wheel of Rebirth," Qiuhun suddenly spoke up.

Jintong and the others looked at him in surprise.

The master of the Wheel of Rebirth looked at Qiuhun, a hint of approval flashing in his eyes.

"Thank you, master," Ziling said after a moment of hesitation, her expression returning to normal.

The master of the Wheel of Rebirth didn't object, and simply pointed to the water pool below the Wheel of Rebirth, saying indifferently, "Go in."

Ziling walked to the edge of the water pool, took a deep breath, lifted her skirt, and slowly stepped in.

The water was unexpectedly warm, and soon reached her chest.

Ziling felt a dizziness in front of her, her consciousness becoming hazy, and she soon fell asleep, her body floating on the surface of the water.

The master of the Wheel of Rebirth clasped his hands together, and a chanting sound came from his mouth. He pointed at the Six Paths Wheel of Rebirth, and a layer of boundless Wheel of Rebirth energy spread out.

The Six Paths Wheel of Rebirth began to rotate, emitting a red light pillar that enveloped Ziling.

Ziling's body slowly sank into the water pool.

... About the time it took to burn an incense stick, the water pool suddenly erupted with a string of dense bubbles, and Ziling, who had been sleeping, suddenly woke up, bursting out of the water and landing beside the Six Paths Wheel of Rebirth.

Her body was soaked in water, and she stood there, her eyes unfocused, her pupils slightly constricted, as if staring at the ground, but her mind was clearly not there.

Han Li appeared beside her, placing a hand on her shoulder.

"Ziling," he called out softly.

Ziling's body trembled slightly, and she slowly raised her head to look at Han Li, as if seeing him for the first time. She stared at his face for a moment, and then her pupils gradually regained their luster.

"Han Li..."

She called out softly, and then suddenly opened her arms and hugged Han Li, burying her face in his chest.

Han Li looked down at the person in his arms, his heart filled with complex emotions, but he still gently wrapped his arms around her, stroking her shoulders to comfort her.

However, Ziling's clothes were soaked, and as she tightly hugged Han Li, she soon felt a strange sensation. Her ears felt warm, and she pulled back from Han Li's embrace.

A burst of light flashed on her body, and the water vapor on her clothes evaporated instantly.
