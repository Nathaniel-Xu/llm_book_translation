Inside the Shura Blood Gate, at first glance, it was a world of blood red, with waves of extremely dense and powerful blood energy emanating from within.

Han Li looked towards the back of the Blood Gate, and saw that it was filled with a liquid-like blood light, with an unimaginable density of blood energy that was more than ten times that of the blood pool in the Accumulated Scales Realm.

The people on the square felt the situation inside the Blood Gate and revealed expressions of surprise and yearning.

"The opening of the Shura Blood Gate is a rare opportunity, and everyone on the square can enter. Let's go." Bai Ze said, taking the lead and stepping into the gate.

The people on the square heard this and immediately erupted into cheers, following closely behind.

The eight tribes of the direct bloodline of the Eight Kings, including Ying Ma, Qing Yuan, Tian Hu, and others, closely followed Bai Ze.

Tian Hu's Liu Yue'er glanced at Han Li, who was standing still, and slightly furrowed her brow.

"Don't worry, Miss Liu, the king has already agreed to let Han Li enter, and he will go in together with us." A figure approached Liu Yue'er and whispered.

Liu Yue'er smiled slightly and turned to follow the others into the Blood Gate.

Fox Three turned to look at Han Li and also entered the Shura Blood Gate.

After all the people from the eight tribes had entered the Blood Gate, the other tribes on the square began to move in order of their seniority, with strict divisions.

Han Li had no intention of provoking these barbarian tribes, and only after everyone had entered did he take a step forward and enter the Shura Blood Gate.

Because Bai Ze had already agreed to let Han Li enter, the people from the various tribes, although dissatisfied, did not dare to say anything.

Some people looked at Han Li with a mixture of wariness and hostility, but Han Li ignored them.

Inside the Shura Blood Gate was a vast space, with the ground resembling a vast expanse of red, writhing blood meat, and blood-colored mist floating everywhere, but without any bloody smell, instead giving off a fresh and clean feeling, as if one had returned to the origin of the universe.

With each breath, one's spirit was invigorated, and their body felt lighter and more agile, as if they had taken a great tonic.

Above the blood-colored space, a layer of blood-colored mist condensed into a blood cloud, emitting waves of extremely dense blood energy, similar to the sulfuric blood cloud in the Accumulated Scales Realm.

Han Li had not expected the inside to be like this, and was both surprised and curious, looking around.

The young people from the various barbarian tribes also revealed expressions of surprise, but the older generation, such as Liu Qing, remained calm and composed, as if they had already known about this place.

Bai Ze did not stop, and took the lead, striding forward, with the others following closely behind.

The group of people moved forward, and soon arrived at the depths of the blood-colored space.

This place was extremely empty, with a flat ground, resembling a blood-colored square.

On the square, eight massive blood-colored stone pillars stood upright, with the top of each pillar disappearing into the blood cloud above, and each pillar was engraved with a majestic and powerful beast, which were the eight True Spirit Kings.

These carvings were extremely lifelike, and emitted a powerful aura, as if they could come to life at any moment.

On each pillar, near the top, was embedded a dark red, ancient-style fire bowl.

However, except for Bai Ze, You Tian, and Luo Hou, the fire bowls on the other pillars had already been extinguished.

The people from the various tribes saw this and gathered around the eight pillars, bowing to the eight True Spirit Kings.

The people from the four tribes of Qing Yuan, Zhuo Wu, Ban Shan, and Tian Hu revealed expressions of sorrow and grief, and knelt down in front of the pillars of Zhuo Wu, Ban Shan, and Tian Hu, wailing and crying.

Xiao Bai also came to the pillar of Mo Yan, and looked at it with a stunned expression, with a hint of tears in his eyes.

As for Han Li, as an outsider, he stood out from the crowd, and quietly walked to a slightly distant location.

He looked at the dense blood energy around him, and secretly activated the Heavenly Slaughter Imprisonment Technique to absorb it, and soon felt a surge of hot energy flowing through his body.

In a short while, he felt that his body's unopened acupoints were stirring, and his body felt invigorated, as if he had taken a great tonic.

However, he did not dare to fully activate his technique, and could only quietly absorb the blood energy around him.

As he absorbed the blood energy, Han Li looked at the eight blood-colored pillars in front of him, his eyes flashing with curiosity.

The eight True Spirit Kings in front of him were probably equally powerful, and Bai Ze's cultivation was unfathomable, and had probably reached the Dao Ancestor Realm.

In that case, the other True Spirit Kings were probably also Dao Ancestor-level existences.

The strength of the barbarian tribes was indeed not to be underestimated, but Han Li wondered if there were any other Dao Ancestors besides these eight.

"Everyone, although the fall of the True Spirit Kings is heartbreaking, we can only accept this reality. The Shura Blood Gate's opening time is limited, so let's collect our emotions and summon the blood energy of the True Spirit Kings." Bai Ze said, after a moment of silence.

The people from the eight tribes of the direct bloodline of the Eight Kings heard this and quickly composed themselves, standing up and gathering around the pillars of their respective tribes.

The other tribes also gathered around, forming a formation.

The Ying Ma tribe, because Bai Ze was still present, did not need to summon the blood energy, and stood aside.

However, the Mo Yan tribe only had Xiao Bai, and he stood alone in front of the pillar, looking somewhat lonely.

The people from the various tribes began to activate their techniques, and a powerful blood energy began to emanate from the pillars, filling the air with an intense aura.
Han Li looked at Xiao Bai, his brow slightly furrowed.

"Han Daoist friend," Li Qi Ma flew over to Han Li's side.

Han Li nodded at Li Qi Ma, saying nothing.

"Han Daoist friend, don't worry, the next step is to summon the true spirit king's bloodline power, and it's not dangerous," Li Qi Ma said with a smile, seeing Han Li's concern.

"Xiao Bai is alone, and compared to the other tribes, he's a bit too isolated," Han Li still looked a bit uneasy.

"Rest assured, summoning the true spirit king's bloodline power isn't about the number of people, Xiao Bai may be alone, but he's the son of the Ink Eye Baizhu, and his bloodline power is extremely rich, making it easier to cast spells," Li Qi Ma said with a smile, seeming to know many things.

"Oh, there's such a saying?" Han Li's eyebrows twitched.

"You'll see," Li Qi Ma said again with a smile.

As soon as Li Qi Ma finished speaking, the people of the various tribes began to cast their spells, using their fingers to draw on their wrists, and a stream of blood shot out from their wrists.

The blood didn't fall to the ground, but instead floated in mid-air, transforming into a blood-colored pattern, quickly intersecting with each other, forming a complex blood-colored magic array that enveloped the stone pillars of the various tribes.

The stone pillars also showed a blood-colored pattern, resonating with the blood-colored magic array.

Xiao Bai, although alone, also used his blood to create a blood-colored magic array, and his array was much brighter than the others.

White Zhe, seeing this scene, suddenly split into seven identical bodies, appearing beside the seven stone pillars.

Zhu Yan, Chuo Yu, Shan Yue, Jiu Wei, and Mo Yan, the five White Zhe, pointed at the fire bowls beside the stone pillars, and a flash of firelight appeared.

The fire bowls inside the stone pillars simultaneously ignited a thread of golden flames.

The people of the five tribes saw this and immediately used all their strength to stimulate the blood-colored magic array above their heads.

A dazzling blood-colored glow burst out from the magic array, and the golden flames on the stone pillars also grew stronger, reflecting the light of the magic array.

At this moment, the five White Zhe simultaneously recited incantations, stimulating the golden flames to jump and dance.

Suddenly, a circle of blood and gold light expanded, merging into the surrounding void.

The Lei Peng and Hun Chou tribes didn't need White Zhe to ignite the wild flames, and they also stimulated their blood-colored magic arrays to operate.

The White Zhe beside them also cast spells, stimulating the golden flames in the fire bowls to flash and jump.

The void was filled with a rapid expansion of blood and gold light, spreading across the various domains, and even the great interfaces, emitting a powerful summoning energy.

"Summoning the bloodline requires some time, and it won't be completed in a short while, so let's wait slowly," Li Qi Ma said, then chatted with Han Li.

"Han...," Han Li chatted with Li Qi Ma, secretly cultivating and absorbing the dense blood energy in the surroundings, while also paying attention to the situation with the stone pillars.

As the two of them chatted, time flew by, and before long, half a day had passed.

The blood-colored stone pillar beside Xiao Bai suddenly flashed, and a white light seeped out from the void, slowly revolving around the golden flames at the top of the pillar.

"Is that the true spirit king's bloodline?" Han Li's eyes lit up.

The white light contained extremely rich true spirit king's bloodline power, similar to Xiao Bai's bloodline, but much more noble.

"Yes, it seems that Xiao Bai's bloodline is indeed the purest, and it was the first to summon the Ink Eye Baizhu's bloodline power," Li Qi Ma nodded slowly.

More and more white lights seeped out from the void, condensing into a single entity, transforming into a snow-white auspicious beast's virtual image, similar to Xiao Bai's Baizhu form, but much more majestic, with a pair of black eyes that seemed to look down on all things.

Especially the snow-white auspicious beast's forehead, which split open a narrow vertical eye, emitting a strange black light.

Xiao Bai looked at the snow-white auspicious beast, and his eyes also showed a pair of strange black lights, flickering constantly.

White Zhe saw this scene and also showed a hint of joy on his face.

Xiao Bai's summoning of the Ink Eye Baizhu's true spirit king's bloodline seemed to have opened a path, and the other four tribes also quickly achieved results.

The Tian Huo tribe's stone pillar's void showed a grayish-white light, and a cluster of grayish-white lights flew out from the void, each emitting a powerful bloodline energy.

These grayish-white lights quickly gathered together, transforming into a nine-tailed fox's virtual image.

The Tian Huo tribe's people saw this scene and showed great joy on their faces.

Among the Tian Huo tribe's people, Liu Le'er's body showed a layer of luminescence, and her skin showed a grayish-white pattern, resonating with the nine-tailed fox's virtual image.

Liu Qing saw Liu Le'er's situation and showed a joyful expression.

Soon, the Qing Yuan, Zhuo Wu, and Ban Shan tribes' stone pillars also showed a flash of light, and the true spirit king's bloodline power gathered in the void, manifesting the true spirit king's virtual image, causing great joy among the three tribes.

However, the Hun Chou and Lei Peng tribes' stone pillars showed no reaction.
