In the face of the blood-red blades that filled the sky, Han Li not only didn't retreat, but instead, the green light on his body surged, accelerating his forward charge, directly crashing into the blades.

However, the chaotic blades didn't cut him to pieces as everyone had imagined. Han Li relied on his physical body to directly shatter all the blades, taking a step forward to trample the silver-horned giant rhino below.

The giant rhino's heart was initially shocked, somewhat surprised by the strength of this human's physique. However, upon sensing that his aura wasn't particularly strong, it didn't feel threatened, and instead, raised its axe to meet Han Li again.

Han Li stepped on the giant axe's blade, and the star power within him suddenly erupted, causing the ground to emit a loud rumble.

With a crisp sound, the giant axe's blade split open, shattering into countless spider web-like cracks.

The silver-horned giant rhino, which was holding the axe, felt a numbness spread throughout its body, causing its legs to bend, and it knelt down under the pressure.

Han Li took advantage of the momentum, his body flashing as he dodged the cloud-patterned tiger's sneak attack, brushing past it, and grasping the back of its neck. With a gentle squeeze, a surge of power entered its body, rendering it unable to resist.

He held the cloud-patterned tiger, which had gone limp, and stepped down again, his foot landing on the silver-horned giant rhino's shoulder, forcing it to kneel down once more.

This entire scene seemed to unfold slowly, but in reality, it happened in the blink of an eye, during Han Li's brief ascent and descent. Even the majority of the two tribes' people didn't have time to see what was happening, only to find that their leaders had been subdued.

The two tribes' people, who had rushed towards the mountain ridge, returned, surrounding Han Li, and shouted for him to release their leaders.

Han Li ignored them, holding the cloud-patterned tiger with one hand, and asking:

"What tribes are you from? Why are you fighting here?"

The cloud-patterned tiger, which was powerless, looked up at Han Li with a gaze filled with hatred and anger, but didn't respond.

"I think you should know what the soul-searching technique is. Don't force me to use it, the feeling is unbearable." Han Li's face turned cold, his voice icy.

Upon hearing this, the cloud-patterned tiger's body trembled slightly, but still didn't speak.

"Not seeing the coffin, not shedding tears..."

Han Li sneered, raising a finger to poke the tiger's forehead, and a crystal thread emerged, writhing like a snake, extending towards the tiger's brow.

"We are the Cloud-Patterned Tiger Tribe, and they are the Silver-Horned Rhino Tribe. We're fighting because of an ancient feud between our tribes." It wasn't the cloud-patterned tiger that spoke, but the silver-horned giant rhino, which was being pressed down by Han Li.

Han Li's expression changed slightly upon hearing this, and he thought to himself that there seemed to be more to the story.

"You're speaking up for your sworn enemy, it's clear you don't want me to use the soul-searching technique on him. This can only mean one thing: you're trying to hide something from me..." Han Li looked at the silver-horned giant rhino, his voice cold.

The rhino's heart was filled with fear and regret, and it could only silently curse its own misfortune.

Humans are indeed cunning and deceitful!

Han Li didn't hesitate, pointing his finger at the cloud-patterned tiger's brow.

A crystal light emerged from his fingertip, and a crystal thread shot into the tiger's head.

"Roar..."

The silver-horned giant rhino let out a loud roar, and the two tribes' people, who had been fighting, suddenly stopped, and like a tidal wave, they charged towards Han Li, disregarding their leaders' safety.

Han Li's mind stirred, and a green light burst forth from his body, as thirty-six green bamboo swords shot out, transforming into thirty-six golden lightning pillars, encircling him within a radius of several hundred feet.

The golden lightning pillars emitted a dazzling light, and massive golden lightning balls burst forth, jumping between the swords, creating a deafening crackling sound.

These barbaric creatures were already afraid of heavenly lightning and earthly fire, and Han Li's golden lightning wall blocked their path, causing them to hesitate and not dare to advance.

Han Li took advantage of this opportunity to quickly search the cloud-patterned tiger's soul.

A moment later, his eyes flashed, and he slowly withdrew his finger, his expression becoming somewhat strange.

From the cloud-patterned tiger's memories, Han Li learned the true reason behind the two tribes' conflict.

The silver-horned giant rhino hadn't lied; the two tribes indeed had an ancient feud, having fought for millions of years in this barbaric region.
However, the direct cause of their current outbreak of conflict was not this.

Thirty years ago, the True Spirit King, who had always been revered as the common master of the Barbarian tribes, suddenly issued a decree to hold a Blood Sacrifice Conference in the Barbarian Sacred Temple of the Eight Desolations, summoning all the tribes that still possessed the ancient Eight Kings' bloodline to gather at the Eight Desolations Mountain.

These ancient Eight Kings were the eight True Spirit Kings who ruled the Barbarian Domain in ancient times. However, due to some unknown event in the history of the Barbarian Domain, the original eight True Spirit Kings had already declined, leaving only one True Spirit King.

The descendants of the other True Spirit Kings also had different fates. Some were still powerful and ruled over a domain, while others, although no longer in power, had widespread descendants and influence. As for those who were less fortunate, their bloodline might have been severed, making it difficult to track them down.

This Blood Sacrifice Conference was originally the most grand gathering in the history of the Barbarian Domain, but due to the Eight Kings' bloodline not being complete, it had not been held for tens of millions of years.

As soon as the news of the True Spirit King's decision to reconvene the conference spread, it was like a stone thrown into a pond, causing a massive stir throughout the Barbarian Domain. Every tribe in the domain considered it an honor to participate in the conference.

The Silver Horned Rhinoceros and Cloud Patterned Tiger tribes were no exception. However, they had no connection to the bloodline of the Barbarian Eight Kings, and even the strongest tribes in the domain, not to mention the powerful Barbarian Hundred Clans, were not qualified to participate in the conference.

Of course, these two remote tribes had not expected to participate in the conference in the first place. After all, the tribes that still possessed the bloodline of the eight True Spirit Kings were mostly part of the Barbarian Hundred Clans.

However, due to an unexpected event, the Silver Horned Rhinoceros tribe discovered a young beast outside their territory, which contained the bloodline of one of the Barbarian Eight Kings.

The young beast seemed to have suffered severe injuries and was still in a deep sleep, being protected by the Silver Horned Rhinoceros tribe.

Just as the Silver Horned Rhinoceros tribe was preparing to secretly transport the young beast to the Eight Desolations Mountain, the news was leaked, and their arch-nemesis, the Cloud Patterned Tiger tribe, found out.

The Cloud Patterned Tiger tribe was unwilling to let the Silver Horned Rhinoceros tribe gain an advantage, as this would mean their own tribe would face extinction. Therefore, they took the opportunity to attack the Silver Horned Rhinoceros tribe and seize the young beast.

Han Li's palm loosened, and the Cloud Patterned Tiger leopard he had captured fell to the ground, unconscious.

"Where is the young beast you rescued?" Han Li asked, looking down at the Silver Horned Rhinoceros giant who was being pressed down by him.

The giant rhinoceros remained silent, but a strange light flashed in his eyes.

Han Li was startled and quickly pressed his palm on the giant's head, saying, "You're trying to self-destruct your soul, aren't you? You're really ruthless towards yourself."

"You'll never get any information from me," the Silver Horned Rhinoceros giant retorted, his mouth filled with blood.

Han Li's palm shone with a crystalline light, protecting his spiritual sea and soul from the giant's self-destruction.

"Your tribe has tens of thousands of people, and you think self-destructing your soul will be of any use? If I want to find the young beast, no one can stop me. I'm not willing to kill you, but you're forcing me to take drastic measures," Han Li said, his brow furrowed.

When Han Li said this, the Silver Horned Rhinoceros giant calmed down slightly, but then he said, "You humans are full of tricks, and I won't believe you. You might as well kill me."

"Believe it or not, I have no ill intentions towards the young beast. I just want to ask you some questions, and if you answer truthfully, I'll let you go," Han Li said.

Seeing that Han Li had not killed the Cloud Patterned Tiger leopard and had stopped him from self-destructing, the Silver Horned Rhinoceros giant began to believe him.

"Is this true?" he asked, still uncertain.

"Your tribe's location in the Barbarian Domain is where?" Han Li asked.

The Silver Horned Rhinoceros giant hesitated, seemingly not expecting Han Li to ask this question.

"We belong to the Earth Dragon tribe's subordinate territory, located in the southwestern edge of our territory," he replied after a brief pause.

Han Li was taken aback by this answer, as was the Silver Horned Rhinoceros giant.

"How is the Barbarian Domain divided? What is the relationship between your region and the great immortal domains?" Han Li asked, his brow furrowed.

"Our Barbarian Domain is boundless, and the division of our territory is based on the territories of the various great tribes. For example, the Nine-Tailed Heavenly Fox tribe's territory, the Great Peacock tribe's territory, and so on. The Earth Dragon tribe's territory is located between the Golden Source Immortal Domain and the Lingtai Immortal Domain," the Silver Horned Rhinoceros giant replied.

"The Golden Source Immortal Domain, which borders the Lingtai Immortal Domain, isn't that the same domain where the Nine Yuan Observatory is located?" Han Li muttered to himself.

He hadn't expected that his physical body had traveled to a location near the Golden Source Immortal Domain.

As he thought about this, Han Li's mind began to wander, and he had an idea.

However, he quickly suppressed this idea, remembering his previous encounter with the ice and fire woman, who had pursued him relentlessly. He realized that his current strength was still far from that of a true mid-stage Deity Transformation cultivator, and that venturing into the Golden Source Immortal Domain to gather information about the Golden Boy would be suicidal.
