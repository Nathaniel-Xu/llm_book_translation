Yue Mian transformed into a massive blue bird, spreading its wings to carry Han Li, Jin Tong, and Xiao Bai high into the air. In the blink of an eye, they pierced through the layers of cloud, but didn't stop, continuing to ascend.

The surrounding space's spiritual energy rapidly thinned, and the sky gradually became clearer.

"Hold on," Yue Mian's voice came, as two claws extended.

Innumerable blue talismans shot out, transforming into streams of blue energy that surrounded them.

The blue bird's speed increased a hundredfold, and everything around them became a blur.

Han Li's body shook, almost being flung out, and he hastily activated his cultivation technique to stick to the blue bird.

The surroundings rapidly changed, and after a moment, the blue bird seemed to break through a boundary, entering a unique space.

The surroundings were a deep blue, pure and clean, without a single cloud or speck of dust, yet exuding an ancient, desolate atmosphere.

However, there was no spiritual energy in this place, nor any other energy, only endless emptiness.

Han Li gazed upon this scene, feeling a sense of wonder.

He had never flown so high before, and he realized that this was the sight that awaited him after piercing through the clouds.

"What is this place...I've never been here before," Jin Tong muttered, looking around.

"This is the Qing Ming Domain," Xiao Bai's voice suddenly came from beside him.

"Qing Ming Domain?" Han Li was taken aback.

"I saw it in my father's memories," Xiao Bai continued. "In the high skies of the True Immortal Realm, there are three major regions. This is the Qing Ming Domain, the closest to the ground. Beyond the Qing Ming Domain lies the Tian Feng Domain, and beyond that is the Tian Wai Domain, also known as the Tian Wai Virtual Void."

"Qing Ming Domain, Tian Feng Domain, Tian Wai Domain..." Han Li murmured.

"These three regions are extremely high and filled with danger," Xiao Bai said. "For example, the Qing Ming Domain lacks even a hint of spiritual energy, and staying here for too long will harm a cultivator's body. Ordinary cultivators rarely come here, so there's little record of it in the classics."

Han Li nodded, understanding.

Actually, with his cultivation, coming to the Qing Ming Domain wasn't difficult, but he had been busy cultivating and evading the Heavenly Court's pursuit, so he hadn't had the chance to explore the outer space.

Jin Tong's brow furrowed, seemingly uncomfortable with the environment.

"Jin Tong, are you okay?" Han Li asked.

"I'm fine," Jin Tong replied. "As a Xiong Jin Xian, I devour all things to live, and this place lacks even a hint of spiritual energy, making me feel uneasy."

"Then you should rest in the Flower Petal Space," Han Li said.

Seeing Jin Tong nod, Han Li waved his hand and pulled him into the Flower Petal Space.

The blue bird continued to fly towards the high skies, its speed unchanged.

The Qing Ming Domain was enormous, and even with the blue bird's speed, it took a small half-hour to reach the end.

Ahead, the void began to shake, and a gray-black storm erupted, with wave after wave of wind sweeping past, emitting a deafening howl.

"Could this be the Tian Feng Domain?" Han Li's eyes narrowed, murmuring.

"Most likely," Xiao Bai said. "The Tian Feng Domain is filled with the Nine Heavens' Gale, extremely dangerous, but compared to the Tian Wai Virtual Void, it's nothing."

He hadn't finished speaking when the blue bird charged into the Nine Heavens' Gale without hesitation.

The surrounding gray-black storm surged, emitting a deafening roar, and even Han Li felt his ears ache, as if they were being pierced. He hastily activated his time law to protect his eardrums.

Xiao Bai's body also radiated a layer of white light, shielding himself.

The gray-black storm raged, and the blue bird flew steadily, its speed unchanged, as it pierced through the Nine Heavens' Gale.

Han Li initially felt some concern, but seeing the blue bird's stability, he relaxed, observing the surroundings.

These gray-black storms were unlike any wind he had seen before, filled with boundless power, as if they could tear apart anything.

Within the gray-black storms, he occasionally saw fine black lines, which would tear through the void, creating fissures.

However, those black lines were easily repelled by the blue bird's body.

Xiao Bai's eyes suddenly lit up, and he raised his hand.

A white light shot out from his body, and a white cloth bag appeared, which was the life-bound artifact his father had given him.

The bag expanded tenfold, its opening radiating a white glow, emitting a massive suction force.
Within a thousand-mile radius, the nine-heavenly wind gale flew in like a whale sucking in water, instantly entering the white cloth bag.

Those fine black lines also followed the surrounding nine-heavenly wind gale, entering the white cloth bag.

The white cloth bag absorbed the nine-heavenly wind gale, but did not stop, continuing to fly towards other places, as if it was a devouring beast, leaving nothing but empty space in its wake.

"What do you want to do with these nine-heavenly wind gales?" Han Li asked.

"I'm not looking for ordinary nine-heavenly wind gales, but those fine black lines, which are the Black Clay Wind, a product of the nine-heavenly wind gale's power condensed over millions of years. I remembered a secret technique from my father's memories, which can be used to refine a Wind-Breaking Pearl using those Black Clay Winds. Its power is immense, even a Da Luo cultivator cannot withstand it. It's rare to come to this Tian Feng domain, so I'm taking this opportunity to collect some and try refining it." Xiao Bai smiled and said, then used his fingers to control the white cloth bag, continuously collecting the Black Clay Winds.

Han Li nodded slightly, his eyes fixed on the white cloth bag, a strange glint in his eyes.

When Xiao Bai first took out the white cloth bag, Han Li had subconsciously released a strand of his divine sense to investigate, but it was instantly swallowed by the white cloth bag and extinguished.

This bag was unassuming, but it seemed to contain some extraordinary power. This was just the result of Xiao Bai's casual control, and Han Li wondered what kind of power it would unleash if truly activated.

As the blue giant bird flapped its wings and flew swiftly, it soon reached the end of the Tian Feng domain.

It stretched out its claws and grasped the air, creating a massive spatial rift. The giant bird flew into it, and Han Li's vision blurred.

When his vision cleared, he found himself in a black space filled with countless meteorites of varying sizes. Some were as small as houses, while others were enormous, their edges invisible to the naked eye. They were all moving in irregular patterns, colliding with each other and producing deafening crashes.

Some of the meteorites emitted dull, five-colored lights, while others shone with various colors, illuminating the black space.

A blue ice crystal storm suddenly swept in from the distance, stretching 100,000 miles, like a gigantic blue dragon. It emitted a terrifying cold aura.

The smaller meteorites were instantly frozen and shattered by the storm, which then swept them away. The larger meteorites were also covered in a thick layer of blue ice.

As the blue storm passed, a massive purple cloud appeared, enveloping the space. The cloud flashed with purple lightning, shattering the frozen meteorites.

The cloud dissipated, and a massive black whirlpool suddenly appeared in the void, spinning rapidly.

Everything near the whirlpool was drawn in, consumed by its power.

However, the whirlpool vanished as quickly as it appeared, leaving no trace.

"Outer Void!" Han Li exclaimed, standing up.

This black space gave him a sense of boundless infinity. His Nine Yin Demon Eyes could see through everything, but here, they couldn't see very far. His divine sense was also limited, unable to spread as easily as it did on the ground.

Han Li could vaguely sense that there was a power in this space that was billions of times stronger than the rotation of the sun and moon, slowly operating.

"The Outer Void is fraught with danger, but it also contains infinite treasures. With your cultivation, you've barely qualified to come here. You can come here to train and gain experience, which will greatly benefit your cultivation." The blue giant bird spoke, continuing to fly forward.

This time, it didn't fly upwards, but instead flew forward.

"Indeed, there are many treasures here." Xiao Bai's body flashed with white light as he transformed into a Qilin shape, his nose twitching excitedly.

He took out the white cloth bag again, opened his mouth, and spat out a ball of white light, which entered the bag.

The white cloth bag expanded, becoming hundreds of miles in size. Its surface became semi-transparent, forming a web-like net.

The bag emitted a devouring energy, drawing in nearby meteorites, which shattered and revealed colorful, precious minerals.

In a short time, the bag had stored hundreds of valuable materials.

Han Li watched in awe, his curiosity about the white cloth bag growing.

"Friend Han, your cultivation has reached a high level, but you don't know much about the Dao Ancestors. Their abilities far surpass your imagination. If we fly below, we might be detected by other Dao Ancestors, so it's safer to come to this Outer Void." The blue giant bird said.

"I understand." Han Li nodded, his eyes flashing with insight.

The blue giant bird flew forward, its wings beating rapidly. The surroundings blurred, and everything seemed to be retreating.

The giant bird flew straight ahead, its body undulating with cyan ripples.

These ripples seemed ordinary, but they contained immense power. The meteorites, regardless of size, would instantly evaporate upon contact with the giant bird, unable to slow it down.

The ice storms, lightning clouds, and black holes were all effortlessly dispelled, leaving no trace.

Han Li was shocked by the blue giant bird's divine abilities once again.

He had seen the abilities of Da Luo cultivators before, but this experience was different. The giant bird's power was like a chasm, a vast gap between their cultivation levels.
