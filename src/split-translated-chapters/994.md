Shi Kongyu faced the black crab Daoist's war knife in the air without fear. He raised his arm and punched upwards, his fist bursting with purple lightning.

Boom!

The clash of fist and blade caused the space to shake violently, tearing open seven or eight spatial cracks.

Shi Kongyu and the black crab Daoist were both pushed back by the impact. 

But soon, the three of them fought fiercely again.

Han Li, who was hiding in the distance, was initially shocked by the scene, but his expression quickly returned to calm, with a pensive look on his face.

The situation here was exactly as the crab Daoist had told him not long ago. It seemed that the crab Daoist had not lied to him. The intensity of this battle far exceeded what he had described.

Han Li looked up at the illusory circular wheel in the sky. Many of the time runes on it had already been extinguished.

He withdrew his gaze and wondered if he should leave now.

In fact, there was no point in him continuing to stay. He could not do anything for the crab Daoist from back then with his weak body. And for him, who already knew that the future crab Daoist would achieve the Dao Ancestor realm, everything happening now might not necessarily be a bad thing.

Just as he was considering whether to go somewhere else, a loud collision sounded and the fierce battle suddenly stopped.

Shi Kongyu's figure shot backwards, stopping near the entrance of the underground cave.

Han Li was shocked and quickly hid in the shadows behind the door, running the Wanqiao Empty Silence Technique at full strength to suppress his aura.

Shi Kongyu did not attack again. He just stood there, a smile even appearing on his face.

Since the enemy did not attack, the two Slash Corpse Puppets did not make a move either. 

However, seeing the expression on Shi Kongyu's face, the two puppets frowned like ordinary people, their expressions lifelike and no different from real humans.

"Friend Shi Kongyu, we are evenly matched. No matter how long we fight, there will be no outcome. I'll say it again, you should leave." The white crab Daoist slowly opened his mouth.

"You're right, I've long known that we are evenly matched and it's almost impossible to defeat you," Shi Kongyu said with a slight smile.

Behind the entrance, Han Li heard Shi Kongyu's words and was slightly stunned.

If what Shi Kongyu said was true, why did he fight so hard against the two Slash Corpse Puppets for so long? It was clear he had other intentions!

The two Slash Corpse Puppets also realized this problem now. Their expressions sank and they immediately transformed into black and white light, pouncing towards Shi Kongyu.

"Haha..." Shi Kongyu laughed loudly, completely ignoring the actions of the two Slash Corpse Puppets. He suddenly punched his chest.

With a splattering sound, a fist-sized gray bone flew out from his body. A black symbol resembling a dried octopus was engraved on it.

The moment the gray bone left Shi Kongyu's body, gray flames immediately appeared on its surface, burning fiercely.

Within the gray flames, countless black symbols faintly emerged, condensing into a human face pattern. Its features were ferocious, filled with deep grief and resentment. It let out rapid and crazed strange noises that shocked those who saw it.

Immediately, a cold and eerie law fluctuation spread out from the gray flames and dispersed in all directions.

Jilei empty realm rejected all other elemental energies and law powers were no exception.

As soon as this cold law appeared, it began to weaken, but it did not immediately disappear. It continued to disperse, quickly filling the entire underground space.

Han Li was behind Shi Kongyu, closest to him, and was the first affected by this law power.

He felt his mind go dizzy as an invisible force directly penetrated deep into his soul, stirring it.

Han Li's originally pure soul suddenly dimmed, as if covered with a layer of dust. His soul force churned, the small person in his soul letting out irritated roars.

He saw various bizarre illusions, signs that inner demons were arising.

At the same time, Han Li felt nauseous, his body experiencing a desire to vomit that he had not felt in countless years, wanting to throw up his internal organs.

"What is this law?!"

Han Li was greatly shocked and hurriedly severed his connection to his physical body while running his soul cultivation technique at full power to stabilize his soul's fluctuations.

The two Slash Corpse Puppets were also enveloped by the cold law power, their faces immediately showing pain.

"Curse law!" The two puppets' expressions changed drastically. They immediately stopped and pounced towards the crab Daoist with all their strength.

At the same time, black light surged around them as two intense law fluctuations erupted, enveloping the crab Daoist and his blood-colored barrier.

Although the two puppets moved fast, they were still a step too late. A cold law force invaded the blood-colored barrier before they could deploy their law defenses, entering the crab Daoist's body.

Pfft!

Inside the blood-colored barrier, the crab Daoist, who was originally making an all-out attempt to break through to the Dao Ancestor realm, was attacked by the curse law. He spat out a mouthful of blood.

The light around him became chaotic, and the human-shaped light mass above his head fluctuated violently, showing signs of collapse.
