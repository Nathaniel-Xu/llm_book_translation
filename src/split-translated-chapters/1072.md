Han Li's eyes flashed as he spoke in a calm tone, "According to your meaning, Brother Jin, you want to disregard my safety and force me to submit?"

Jin Liu's expression turned cold as he replied, "Leave the outside matters to be settled outside, this Years Tower can't be delayed. Besides, with us present, do you still think someone would dare to make a move against you?"

Han Li's tone was equally unpleasant as he responded, "If that's the case, then let's part ways. You take your Yangguan Road, and I'll take my solitary path. If you want to use force, then come and try, I'll accompany you."

Lei Yuze, seeing Han Li's displeasure, quickly intervened, "Brother Shi, please don't be angry. According to your account, this is indeed a difficult task. How about this: if you're willing to make some concessions, release Blue's senior brother, and after breaking the seal, you can choose the treasures inside second?"

Wen Zhong and the others also chimed in, trying to persuade Han Li, clearly intimidated by his display of strength earlier.

Han Li paused for a moment before responding, "Since everyone agrees, then fine. I can release your senior brother, but I don't want the treasures inside. Instead, I want to exchange for something else."

Lei Yuze's eyes lit up as he asked, "What do you want to exchange for, Brother Shi?"

"You want me to release your senior brother," Han Li turned to Blue, "then bring me a fire-aging cicada's nest in exchange."

Jin Liu's face stiffened upon hearing this.

"A fire-aging cicada's nest... what's that?" Blue asked, perplexed.

"You don't have it, but that doesn't mean someone else doesn't," Han Li smiled faintly, his eyes glinting with amusement.

Jin Liu's anger boiled over, and he shouted, "Shi Mou, what do you mean?!"

Han Li shrugged, "Just proposing a condition. You all said you'd make sacrifices for the greater good, and I've already made concessions. As for you, Brother Jin, with your noble awareness, surely you won't be stingy about a mere material?"

Jin Liu was taken aback by Han Li's retort, and he glared at him, speechless.

Blue, seeing Han Li's willingness to compromise, quickly approached Jin Liu and asked, "Brother Jin, do you really have the fire-aging cicada's nest? Could you please spare it for me? I'll use xian yuan stones or other precious materials to exchange for it."

Lei Yuze also stepped forward, "Brother Jin, please help us out for the sake of breaking the seal."

Jin Liu's expression turned icy, but he soon seemed to have an idea, and his face relaxed.

"I can give you the fire-aging cicada's nest," Jin Liu said with a faint smile, "but instead of using xian yuan stones or other materials, I'll let Blue choose the treasures first after breaking the seal. That's all I want."

The fire-aging cicada's nest was precious, but the treasures behind the seal were even more valuable to him.

"Alright," Lei Yuze agreed, exchanging a glance with the others.

Han Li, seeing the matter settled, waved his hand, and a silver light flashed, revealing Blue's senior brother, who was still unconscious.

"Senior brother!" Blue rushed over, embracing him.

She and her senior brother were cultivating a fusion of divine techniques, and although they hadn't yet succeeded, they had already developed a special connection, allowing them to sense each other's life and death.

Blue was overjoyed to see her senior brother, but she quickly regained control of her emotions, waving her hand to release a blue light that examined her senior brother's condition.

Han Li ignored Blue and her senior brother, approaching Jin Liu instead.

Jin Liu snorted, waving his hand, and a dark red light flashed, revealing the fire-aging cicada's nest, which pulsed with powerful time law fluctuations.

Except for Su Shuang and Jin Liu, the others were seeing the fire-aging cicada's nest for the first time, and they were all amazed by its immense time law power.

Jin Liu deliberately slowed down his movements, allowing the others to get a good look at the nest.

"Thank you," Han Li said, his eyes glinting with amusement, as he took the nest.

Now that he had all three nests, he could refine them into time law crystals, greatly increasing his time law power. He would be able to use the powerful divine technique that had repelled Qiemozi earlier.

As he thought about the technique's power, Han Li's heart grew hot, and a strong desire arose: to refine the nests immediately and use the technique.

He glanced around, his eyes falling on a side door near the main hall. He was about to step forward when Blue's voice interrupted him.

"Hey, why is my senior brother still unconscious? What did you do to him?"

Han Li's expression remained calm as he replied, "I didn't do anything to him. He's just exhausted."

Blue's eyes narrowed, but before she could press the issue, Han Li flicked his wrist, and a golden light shot out, disappearing into Blue's senior brother's body.

The senior brother's eyes flickered open, and he slowly sat up.

"Senior brother, are you okay?" Blue asked, relief etched on her face.

Han Li's eyes gleamed with amusement as he watched Blue and her senior brother reunite.
Lan Yanzu looked at Lan Yan with a weak expression and said, "Sister, what's going on..."

After Han Li finished his actions, he ignored the Lan siblings and walked towards the side door.

"Stone friend, where are you going?" Su Zhonglian asked hastily as she stood beside him.

"I have some things to take care of, I'll be leaving for a bit. You all can divide the treasures in the formation, don't worry about me." Han Li said calmly and quickly walked to the side door, pushing it open and entering.

The side door led to a small, empty hall with no decorations.

Han Li scanned the area with his divine sense and nodded, then waved his hands.

Multiple colored lights shot out from his sleeves, landing in different parts of the hall.

The others in the main hall saw Han Li leave and changed their expressions, but soon realized he had only gone to the side hall and not left for real. They all let out a sigh of relief.

Han Li's current strength and cultivation had become indispensable in the current situation. If he were to leave, the others wouldn't have the confidence to deal with Li Qiema.

On the edge of the crowd, Xiong Shan and the black-robed couple stood silently, their cultivations being too low to be noticed by the others.

"Is this the place?" the black-robed woman whispered to the black-robed youth beside her.

"It's definitely here," the youth replied, his eyes closed in concentration. He opened them, and a hint of excitement flashed in his eyes.

"Don't get too excited, I heard what you're planning to do isn't easy. Are you sure you can do it?" the black-robed woman asked.

"I wouldn't have come here if I didn't have confidence," the youth replied, his voice laced with dissatisfaction.

The black-robed woman chuckled and said, "That's good, because if you die here, I'll be in trouble."

The youth snorted and didn't respond, closing his eyes again.

The black-robed woman didn't continue the conversation, instead gazing at the side hall with a hint of curiosity.

Xiong Shan stood beside her, also looking at the side hall with an unreadable expression.

Meanwhile, Lan Yan took out a medicinal pill and gave it to Lan Yanzu, who swallowed it and quickly regained his complexion.

"Blue friend, now that your brother is fine, let's start breaking the formation," Lei Yuze said to Lan Yan.

Lan Yan nodded.

...

In the side hall, Han Li looked around and then made a hand seal, his voice low and commanding.

"Begin!"

As he spoke, multiple layers of light screens appeared, covering the entire hall.

After setting up the screens, Han Li opened the entrance to the Flower Branch Space and stepped inside.

The pavilion in the Flower Branch Space was surrounded by a dense, dark aura, forming a massive black ball that rolled and churned.

A terrifying ghostly energy emanated from the ball, causing the plants within a hundred feet to wither and die. Fortunately, the medicinal garden was far enough away to be unaffected.

Han Li knew that Ti Hu was refining the Wu Cang Ghost King and couldn't control the ghostly energy within him.

He raised his hand, and dozens of golden lights shot out from his sleeve, landing around the pavilion and forming a golden light screen.

A temporal law force fluctuated within the screen, instantly suppressing the ghostly energy.

Han Li nodded in satisfaction, pleased with the effect of the formation flag he had created.

He then raised his hand again, and a silver light shot out from his sleeve, transforming into a silver bird that flew around the pavilion.

"Guard the entrance of the Flower Branch Space, if anyone tries to invade, kill them without mercy," Han Li instructed.

The silver bird chirped and flew towards the entrance of the Flower Branch Space.

Han Li finally relaxed, finding a spot to sit down and taking out the three insect nests.

He took a deep breath, activated the "Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique", and his body shone with brilliant golden light. His hands intersected, forming a seal.
