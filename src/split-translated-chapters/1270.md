Grandfather, every year at this time, you always lecture me, my ears are about to grow calluses. Tigerzi heard this, but was somewhat annoyed and complained.

"Hehe, you little brat is impatient, do you know, back then..."

"I know, I know, back then, our Wumeng Island was almost destroyed by external enemies, and in a critical moment, thanks to the timely manifestation of our ancestral god, who personally took action to destroy the enemy..." Without waiting for the old man to repeat the story for the 98th time, Tigerzi quickly interrupted him, shaking his head and saying.

"It's good that you know, but unfortunately, it's been many years since we've seen our ancestral god manifest again..." The old man sighed and said.

"Grandfather, look, look..." Seeing his grandfather's sorrowful expression, the little grandson was about to comfort him, but suddenly shouted.

Immediately, the crowd also erupted into a commotion, almost everyone stopped in their tracks and looked towards the massive ancestral god statue in the center of the island.

The old man heard the noise and quickly turned his head to look, and saw that the giant statue, bathed in the morning light, was now radiating a dazzling blue glow, looking like a giant blue gemstone.

Layer upon layer of dense water-attribute law fluctuations emanated from it, transforming into a blue glow that spread throughout the island, making everyone feel extremely comfortable.

"It's... it's our ancestral god..."

"Our ancestral god has manifested..."

"Our ancestral god is protecting us!"

The square immediately erupted into chaos, with everyone kneeling and praying.

At this time, on the statue, a figure suddenly appeared, floating in mid-air, and flew away towards the outside, quickly disappearing from everyone's view.

This caused all the Wumeng Island residents to panic, standing up from the ground and shouting in surprise.

At this time, the remaining island leaders, who had just arrived from outside, crossed paths with the figure, and were left suspended in mid-air, looking at each other in confusion.

When they saw a man in a blue robe, slightly plump and refined, flying through the air, they finally relaxed and rushed to greet him.

"Luofeng, the leader of the Luofeng clan, was that our ancestral god who just left the island?" A man in a gray robe asked.

The refined man was indeed Luofeng, the leader of the Wumeng Island clan, and his expression was also somewhat serious, but he only nodded and looked in the direction of the ancestral god's departure, without speaking.

"What's going on? Is it another external enemy attack?" A woman in a purple robe asked anxiously.

"Everyone, please go to the meeting hall and wait, I'll come and meet with you after I've settled the clan." Luofeng stabilized his mind and said.

In fact, he also didn't know why the ancestral god, who had been in seclusion for so long, had suddenly left the island.

The dozens of island leaders from outside didn't dare ask any more questions, and flew down to the island.

Luofeng hesitated for a moment before flying back to the square.

"Clan leader..."

"Clan leader, our ancestral god..."

The crowd saw him and quickly surrounded him, asking questions.

"You don't need to be alarmed, our ancestral god has manifested due to the will of heaven and earth. You've been fortunate enough to see him, and you should be grateful and pray for his protection." Luofeng scanned the crowd and said slowly.

The Wumeng Island residents heard this and were overjoyed, praying again.

"Ancestral god, why did you suddenly leave..."

Luofeng saw this and sighed inwardly, turning to head towards the meeting hall.

 Inside were the leaders of the surrounding islands, who were not as easily deceived as the island residents.

...

A thousand miles away from the island, a blue figure flew across the sea, landing on a small black island, about a hundred meters in diameter. The figure was tall and had an ordinary appearance, almost identical to Han Li, but it was actually his Earthly Soul Avatar.

On the island, a man in a blue robe and a girl in a yellow dress were standing with their backs to him.

"You've finally returned..." The Earthly Soul Avatar said.

The man turned around, smiling, but before he could speak, the girl interrupted him.

"Uncle, is this the Earthly Soul Avatar you were talking about? It really looks just like you, equally unremarkable and unattractive..."

The girl walked up to the avatar, circling around him, examining him from head to toe.

The man and the girl were Han Li and Jintong.

"It's almost at the level of a late-stage Golden Immortal, better than I expected." Han Li finally spoke.

The girl looked at him with a mischievous grin, "I think it's pretty good, but it's not as handsome as you, uncle."

Han Li smiled wryly, "It's not about being handsome, it's about being powerful."
"After losing contact with you, there was no time crystal to accelerate the condensation of heavy water, but there was also no need to supply heavy water to you. With the constant support of the power of faith, the speed of cultivation was not too slow. Now, I can already condense three layers of heavy water," said the Earth Spirit's incarnation.

Han Li was silent for a moment, then turned his wrist, and a whistling sound erupted from behind him.

A half-person-high black hollow treasure wheel appeared, with water dao patterns condensed on its surface, emitting auras of water laws.

"Now, this heavy water true wheel is no longer useful to me, and its law properties are compatible with yours, so I'll leave it to you," said Han Li, waving his hand, and the black treasure wheel shrank to the size of a palm, flying towards the Earth Spirit's incarnation.

The latter received it with a nod, and as they were originally one, there was no need for thanks.

"Luofeng is quite capable, and has managed Umo Island well over the years. You might not think much of it, but it's worth taking a look," said the Earth Spirit's incarnation, its expression calm.

Han Li hesitated for a moment, then said, "Alright."

The three of them then flew back towards Umo Island.

As they approached the island, Han Li didn't follow the Earth Spirit's incarnation onto the island, but instead bid farewell to Jintong, letting her return to the Huazhi Cave Heaven, while he himself used the Wanyue Kongji technique to conceal his aura, sneaking onto the island.

When they arrived at the island's central square, they found that the islanders were still gathered, praying.

The Earth Spirit's incarnation had to fly back to the statue, revealing its divine presence once again, to reassure the faithful that their ancestral god had not abandoned them, and they gradually dispersed.

At that moment, in the Council Chamber, Luofeng sat in the main seat, holding a teacup, sipping slowly, with a calm and gentle demeanor. The tribal leaders on either side of him were still discussing the recent departure of the ancestral god.

"Luofeng, in previous years, when we came to pay our respects, the ancestral god would never appear. What happened this time, and why did the god leave the island?" a tribal leader asked cautiously.

In fact, not only Umo Island, but also the ancestral gods of other islands, rarely left their own domains, as they could receive the power of faith from their followers at any time, and were in their own unique realm.

Moreover, the current sea region was almost entirely under Umo Island's control, with few conflicts, and no need for the ancestral god to intervene personally.

So, the sudden departure of the ancestral god was a cause for concern and speculation.

"Everyone, please calm down, the ancestral god has returned to the island after a brief inspection," Luofeng said, putting down his teacup, and waving his hand.

Just then, he had received a transmission from the Earth Spirit's incarnation, and his heart was at ease.

The others heard his words, still harboring doubts, but soon felt a powerful energy enveloping the entire Council Chamber, and they finally believed.

The Council Chamber quickly returned to its usual harmonious and relaxed atmosphere.

After the meeting, the tribal leaders also paid their respects to the ancestral god's statue, and then returned to their respective islands.

Luofeng hurried to the island's forbidden area, the "Ancestral God's Temple."

The Ancestral God's Temple was built in the center of the island, below the massive ancestral god statue, where the Earth Spirit's incarnation usually meditated.

When Luofeng arrived at the temple, the doors were already open, and he announced his presence before entering.

As soon as he entered, he saw the Earth Spirit's incarnation sitting cross-legged on a meditation cushion, eyes closed.

"Pay your respects to the ancestral god," Luofeng said, bowing.

"How was the council meeting?" the Earth Spirit's incarnation asked, slowly opening its eyes.

"They're still trying to probe and gather information, except for the few islands that surrendered to us early on," Luofeng replied.

"It's nothing, with your current True Immortal realm cultivation, you can deter them," the Earth Spirit's incarnation said.

"Umo Island's prosperity is all thanks to the ancestral god's protection, and I will always remember this," Luofeng said, bowing.

Just then, a voice suddenly came from Luofeng's side, and Han Li's figure appeared out of thin air.

Luofeng was startled, and quickly turned to look, and when he saw Han Li's appearance, his expression changed again, and he said, "Is it... is it Lord Liu?"

Han Li was slightly taken aback, and then remembered that he had used the alias "Liu Shi" before, and said, "Yes."

"Welcome, Lord Liu..." Luofeng said, bowing again.

"No need for formalities, I have come to ask for your help," Han Li said, waving his sleeve, and a surge of energy lifted Luofeng up.

The Earth Spirit's incarnation and Luofeng were both slightly surprised.

"Please speak, Lord Liu, and we will do our best to assist you," Luofeng said.

"I want to close up in the Black Wind Sea for a while, and I need your help to find a secluded island with no human habitation," Han Li said.
