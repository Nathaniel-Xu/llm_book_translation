About a quarter of an hour later.

In the Jiumen Guan, a remote mountain forest, a figure with a hidden aura, Han Li, sat cross-legged on a towering ancient tree over a hundred meters tall, its dense leaves blocking out the sunlight, making his figure invisible.

His hand held the jade pendant, pressed against his brow.

A moment later, the jade pendant's glow dimmed, and Han Li put it away, closing his eyes to think for a moment before opening them again.

The jade pendant contained a map of the Jiumen Guan's region, marking the possible location of Jintong's imprisonment, a forbidden area within the Jiumen Guan that even core disciples and elders couldn't enter at will.

Han Li pondered for a moment before taking out another jade slip to examine it, nodding to himself and muttering:

"The map provided by the Lunhui Hall is indeed similar to the one given by Lanyan, it seems they haven't made any changes. However, I didn't expect Jintong to be imprisoned in such a place, this is quite troublesome..."

As he pondered, a distant "boom" echoed through the air, accompanied by faint cries of battle.

"It seems the Lunhui Hall's actions are not small, the Jiumen Guan, a behemoth with a foundation of billions of years, has fallen into such chaos, it's hard to imagine." Han Li stood at the top of the tree, gazing into the distance, sighing.

After a moment, he jumped down, not flying high into the air, but instead landing softly on the forest floor, flying low towards a nearby mountain peak.

At this time, within the Jiumen Guan, a large group of black-clad, masked figures stormed in, turning the formerly serene place into a battlefield.

Han Li flew through the Jiumen Guan's depths, passing by important locations, all of which had large numbers of Lunhui Hall disciples, with cultivations not low, including high-level experts and even Da Luo realm existence.

The Jiumen Guan naturally dispatched a large number of elders and disciples to engage the invaders, while the sect's various defensive mechanisms were activated.

However, the Lunhui Hall's sudden attack caught the Jiumen Guan off guard, taking advantage of the chaos in the Dajin Yuan Xian domain, and the fact that many high-ranking cultivators were outside, gathered at the Nine Yuan City.

This move was indeed unexpected, who could have thought that the Jiumen Guan, with its illustrious reputation and the presence of the Daozu, would be attacked?

Han Li's mind was filled with doubts: the Lunhui Hall must have invested heavily in this operation, but what was their true goal?

At this time, the Jiumen Guan's disciples, though initially caught off guard, quickly regrouped under the leadership of their elders, using the defensive mechanisms to block the enemy's advance, resulting in a stalemate.

Han Li had no intention of participating in the conflict, transforming into an unremarkable Jiumen Guan disciple, flying quickly towards the sect's depths.

His current identity was unremarkable, and the sect's interior was in chaos, with no one paying attention to him.

Moreover, with his cultivation, unless it was a Da Luo existence, no one could affect him.

Soon, Han Li arrived at the Jiumen Guan's depths, where the Lunhui Hall's people had not yet reached.

He slowed down his speed, using his hands to activate the stealth divine ability of the black mask.

Han Li's body flashed with black light, and he became a vague, shadowy figure, not emitting a single thread of aura, even with his strong divine sense, he couldn't detect anything unusual.

He saw this and felt a sense of joy, continuing to fly forward.

Although the Lunhui Hall's people had not appeared here, the Jiumen Guan had not relaxed its vigilance, activating all defensive and surveillance mechanisms, setting up a network of traps, to prevent the Lunhui Hall's people from secretly infiltrating.

Fortunately, his divine sense was strong, and the Jiumen Guan's mechanisms were unable to detect him.

Half a day later, he landed near a mountain peak, hiding in a concealed location, looking ahead.

He saw two golden peaks rising into the clouds, standing upright like two pillars supporting the sky.

Between the two peaks, a path stretched out.

On either side of the peaks, a boundless golden mist spread out, connecting the sky and the earth, with no visible end, like a natural barrier.

According to the map provided by Lanyan, this place was called the "Jinyu Guan", the entrance to the inner Jiumen Guan.

The Jiumen Guan's outer and inner areas were distinct, Han Li had previously passed through the outer area, and the inner area was the sect's true core region, only accessible to high-ranking members and a select few.

According to the Lunhui Hall's intelligence, Jintong was currently imprisoned in a forbidden area within the inner Jiumen Guan.

The golden mist that filled the air was a super-grade defensive mechanism, said to have been set up by the Jiumen Guan's Daozu, enveloping the entire inner Jiumen Guan, with only a few entrances like the Jinyu Guan.

Han Li examined the Jinyu Guan, his brow furrowing.

The path was currently closed, with a thick layer of golden light covering the entrance.
Behind the light curtain, a multitude of cultivators clad in golden armor stood densely packed.

"How did the entrance close? Could it be because of the Wheel of Reincarnation's invasion?" Han Li muttered to himself, gritting his teeth.

He pondered for a moment before his divine sense entered the Flower Branch Space, communicating with Lan Yan and informing her of the situation outside. He also asked about the Golden Jade Barrier.

"Brother Han, now that the Wheel of Reincarnation has invaded the Nine Yuan Sect, the closure of the Golden Jade Barrier is quite normal. The truly important areas of the Nine Yuan Sect are all within the Inner Sect, and it will not be allowed to be lost." Lan Yan's voice echoed in Han Li's mind.

"Do you have a way to pass through this place?" Han Li asked, his heart sinking.

 Inside the Flower Branch Space, Lan Yan's face revealed a hesitant expression.

She had told Han Li many things about the Nine Yuan Sect in order to save Lan Yuanzi, but those were not important matters.

However, the Golden Jade Barrier was different, involving the Nine Yuan Sect's core secrets. If the Nine Yuan Sect knew she had told an outsider about this, they would not forgive her.

"Sister Lan, the Nine Yuan Sect is currently in a state of chaos, and no one will notice what's happening here. Moreover, you have never revealed your face, so no one will suspect you." Han Li noticed Lan Yan's hesitation and calmly said.

Lan Yan's face changed, but she quickly calmed down, smiling as she said, "Although you're right, the Nine Yuan Sect has many talented individuals, including those skilled in the art of divination and fortune-telling. I can tell you everything I know about the Nine Yuan Sect, but I have two conditions."

"What conditions?" Han Li asked, his brow furrowed.

"One is to please ask Brother Ti Hu to save my brother." Lan Yan glanced at Ti Hu beside her.

At this moment, Ti Hu, Xiao Bai, and Lan Yan stood together in the Flower Branch Space. Qu Lin, however, was still in the attic, cultivating, with Ti Hu having set up layers of restrictions around him.

Regarding Qu Lin, Ti Hu remained vigilant.

"Alright." Ti Hu's face changed, and after a brief discussion with Han Li, he nodded.

"Thank you, Brother Ti Hu." Lan Yan's eyes revealed a hint of excitement as she bowed to Ti Hu.

"What's the second condition?" Han Li asked.

"I have betrayed the Nine Yuan Sect's many secrets, and I can no longer stay in the sect. Therefore, I and my brother want to join Brother Han, and I ask that you accept us." Lan Yan's head bowed, saying something that left Han Li taken aback.

"Join me?" Han Li was greatly surprised.

Ti Hu and Xiao Bai also revealed surprised expressions.

"Not bad, I've interacted with Brother Han twice, and I have some understanding of his strength and character. With Brother Han's power, you can easily protect me and my brother. I can only inform you of the Nine Yuan Sect's secrets without worries if I have Brother Han's protection." Lan Yan calmly said.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he didn't speak.

Lan Yan saw this and remained silent, her beautiful eyes fixed on Han Li without blinking.

"Since Sister Lan has said so, it's not impossible for me to accept you. However, I must make some things clear: I must plant a restrictive divine technique on you to ensure safety. Of course, if I feel you're trustworthy in the future, I will remove the restrictive technique. As for your future cultivation, I won't interfere or provide any assistance; you'll have to rely on yourselves." Han Li didn't consider it for long before saying.

Lan Yan agreed without hesitation, "Alright."

Han Li's eyes widened slightly in surprise, but he didn't say anything else. He used his divine sense to communicate with Ti Hu, who took action.

Ti Hu muttered to himself, and a black glow flew out from his hand. The black glow quickly changed, transforming into a black ring with countless tiny black symbols jumping within. It looked extremely mysterious.

"Go!" Ti Hu formed a hand seal, and the black ring turned into a black light, disappearing into Ti Hu's mind.

Lan Yan's body trembled, and her face turned pale, but she quickly recovered, her expression calm and without any dissatisfaction.

"Sister Lan has a strong mind and a discerning eye. Your decision to join Master is undoubtedly wise." Ti Hu's eyes flashed with a hint of praise as he lightly smiled.

"Not bad." Xiao Bai also smiled beside him.

Lan Yan heard their words, and her beautiful eyes sparkled.

"Alright, let's not discuss other matters. Please inform me about the Golden Jade Barrier, Sister Lan." Han Li calmly said.

"Yes, the Golden Jade Barrier is an important checkpoint for entering the Inner Sect. According to the rules, only with the permission of the Sect Master, the two Vice Sect Masters, and the four Great Holy Envoys can one enter. However, with the Wheel of Reincarnation's invasion, the situation might be different. If there's a suitable reason, the Golden Armored Guards inside might open the barrier." Lan Yan composed herself and quickly said.
