Han Li led Zi Ling through the desolate void of the outer sky for several days before finally stopping at a meteorite cluster.

This area of meteorites was different from the others, as all the meteorites within it were completely still, and there was no sign of energy storms in the vicinity.

In the center of the meteorite cluster, a massive black sphere floated, its diameter spanning tens of thousands of miles, emitting various different types of primal energy fluctuations, including even fluctuations of the laws.

"This is it, I didn't expect to find it so easily," Han Li said, letting out a breath.

"What is this huge black sphere? And why is it so quiet here?" Zi Ling asked, her face full of surprise.

"Zi Ling, you must have seen those black vortices that can devour everything, right?" Han Li asked.

"I've seen them, are they related to this black sphere?" Zi Ling's eyes widened slightly.

"Those black vortices are the result of the power of space being affected by various factors, causing distortions to form. Some people call them 'void holes'. Void holes can devour all things, whether it's meteorites or various types of primal energy, but they also have their limits. When they reach their limit, they will disappear and transform into a black sphere like this," Han Li explained.

These things were all things he had investigated specifically after his previous visit to the outer void.

"I see," Zi Ling said, enlightened.

"Each black sphere is a treasure trove of energy, containing an enormous amount of energy, and is a natural, high-grade ore vein. Unfortunately, these black spheres are too large to be stored in a spatial artifact, and it's also blocked by the Heavenly Wind Domain, making it impossible to transport them down," Han Li said, shaking his head in regret.

Zi Ling looked at the black sphere in front of her and nodded slightly, clearly also feeling a sense of regret.

If they could transport this black sphere to the lower realm, just the resources contained within it would be enough to establish a sect.

"Let's not get sidetracked, this area with the black sphere is very quiet because it has been devoured by a large amount of primal energy, and it will remain in this state for a long time. Moreover, the black sphere contains a dense and boundless amount of heavenly primal energy, making it an ideal place for cultivation. Let's go into seclusion here," Han Li said with a smile, before continuing.

Zi Ling naturally wouldn't object, and Han Li immediately began to dig a cave into the black sphere, transforming it into a cave dwelling.

He set up restrictions in various places within the cave, then opened the Flower Petal Space, bringing Zi Ling inside.

Han Li activated his spiritual domain and stimulated the Timeless Heavenly Seal Array, causing the flow of time within the Flower Petal Space to change, accelerating by 30,000 times.

"This is your time difference space, it's truly incredible," Zi Ling said, having already heard about it from Han Li and others, but still feeling amazed.

Han Li smiled slightly, not explaining anything, and instead instructed Zi Ling on some things before entering the attic to go into seclusion.

Zi Ling, who had fallen behind in the Six Paths of Reincarnation, was eager to improve her strength and also began to cultivate in seclusion.

Inside the attic, Han Li sat cross-legged, taking out the white jade slip given to him by the master of the Wheel of Reincarnation, which contained the final two layers of the Divine Refining Technique.

He remained silent for a moment, before finally inserting his spiritual sense into the jade slip and beginning to comprehend its contents.

Han Li currently needed power, and even if it meant sacrificing all his future reincarnations, he was willing to do so.

With his experience in cultivating the first five layers of the Divine Refining Technique, he quickly comprehended the final two layers, then slowly began to cultivate.

At Han Li's level, it was common to multitask.

He cultivated the Divine Refining Technique while taking out various materials, spewing out a mouthful of golden flames to envelop them, and began to refine them.

Half a month later, Han Li activated his seal, and the golden flames dispersed, revealing two dark golden puppets, which emitted a faint aura of time laws.

He smiled slightly, then took out two small white bottles, placing them beside him, and a wave of energy similar to the power of the soul emanated from them.

As he activated his seal, a layer of crystal light appeared on his forehead, flashing rapidly.

"Ah!"

Han Li activated his seal for a long time, before suddenly opening his eyes and letting out a low growl.

Two piercing crystal lights shot out of his eyes, like cold electricity in the darkness.

The crystal light on his forehead surged, and two green lights flew out, transforming into two small green figures, which were his soul projections.

Han Li activated his seal, and the two green figures flew out, each entering one of the golden puppets.

He immediately began to activate his seals, and a flurry of golden talismans flew out, pouring into the two golden puppets.

The two golden puppets slowly opened their eyes, and a faint glimmer of life appeared in their empty eyes.

Han Li saw this and nodded slightly, before activating his seal again.

The two small white bottles beside him flew out, releasing two streams of pale golden spiritual liquid, which merged into the puppets' foreheads, causing their eyes to brighten slightly.

Han Li continued to activate his seals, and countless talismans flew out, pouring into the golden puppets.

The golden puppets' bodies gradually emitted a faint golden light, which enveloped them.

Han Li's hands continued to activate his seals, and the golden puppets' bodies slowly began to transform.
Time passed slowly, and over a year had passed in the blink of an eye.

Han Li spread his hands, stopping his spellcasting.

The golden light on the puppet's body quickly dissipated, revealing the puppet's true form.

The two golden puppets had clear and lively eyes, looking almost identical to ordinary people.

Han Li let out a sigh of relief, a faint smile on his face.

His spellcasting over the past few days was a technique for refining a terrestrial embodiment, a small art of the True Speech Sect. The True Speech Sect, as a super-large sect that studied time laws, had naturally researched the art of terrestrial embodiment.

These two puppets were his refined terrestrial embodiments, containing the laws of time within them. In terms of subtlety, they far surpassed the water-attribute terrestrial embodiment he had refined in the Black Wind Sea.

Han Li's refinement of the terrestrial embodiment was not for the purpose of specializing in the art of terrestrial embodiment, nor did he plan to release these two puppets into a populated area to gather faith power. Instead, he was preparing for the Corpse Severing technique.

The Corpse Severing technique of the Tian Huo clan was exceptionally subtle, and he had already used it once, gaining a deeper understanding. For the next two times, he planned to continue using this technique.

Using the terrestrial embodiment for Corpse Severing required a long period of fusion, and the embodiment needed to be sufficiently compatible with the body. However, with the time difference space, time was not a problem.

As Han Li thought, he raised his hand and sent out a burst of golden light, sending the two terrestrial embodiments to the loft below to cultivate on their own. He closed his eyes and sat in meditation.

Refining two terrestrial embodiments in succession, enduring the pain of soul splitting, even with his extremely powerful soul, left him somewhat fatigued.

Han Li sat for half a year before opening his eyes, his gaze sharp and piercing. His soul's damage had completely recovered.

He let out a soft sigh, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light.

At this point, the preparations for Corpse Severing were complete, and the next step was to formally begin the technique.

Han Li's body was suddenly enveloped in a burst of golden light.

His spiritual domain also brightened by several times, with liquid-like golden light flowing slowly.

A surge of heaven and earth spiritual energy transmitted through the air, merging into his spiritual domain. In an instant, the spiritual energy within the Flower Branch Space became several times more dense.

Outside, Zi Ling sensed this situation and revealed a surprised and delighted expression.

She turned her head and gazed deeply at the loft, before quickly withdrawing her gaze and continuing her meditation.

Time passed, and twenty million years went by in the blink of an eye.

Zi Ling's body glowed with black light, each strand of black light resembling a black silken thread, intertwining and enveloping her body, forming a cocoon-like existence.

Her aura was surging, and she had once again reached the peak of the Tai Yi realm.

Zi Ling's previous cultivation had plummeted, but her foundation remained, and the heaven and earth spiritual energy within the Flower Branch Space was extremely dense. After twenty million years of bitter cultivation, she had finally regained her original realm.

Moreover, her current cultivation foundation was stable, and she would not fall again.

Zi Ling opened her eyes, her hands forming a seal, and the black light around her swiftly retreated, merging back into her body.

She revealed a contemplative expression, flipping her hand to retrieve a purple jade bottle with a black talisman attached.

Through the bottle, waves of pure and refined primordial energy still transmitted out, which was the essence of the Mystic True.

Zi Ling hesitated, wondering if she should attempt to break through to the Mahayana realm at this moment.

Just then, the golden spiritual domain suddenly flashed violently and disappeared, and the time difference space also vanished.

The loft's door burst open, and Han Li's figure flew out, his eyebrows locked in a frown, his expression somewhat gloomy.

Zi Ling saw Han Li's appearance and immediately flashed a look of concern, putting away the jade bottle and rising to greet him.

"Your cultivation has made great progress, and it wasn't in vain that you opened the time difference space," Han Li said, his expression brightening as he sensed the surge in Zi Ling's aura.

"Was your cultivation not going smoothly?" Zi Ling asked softly.

"I didn't expect severing the benevolent corpse to be so difficult," Han Li sighed.

"I heard Crab Forefather mention the matter of severing the corpse, but unfortunately, my cultivation wasn't enough, and he didn't elaborate. However, I heard from Qi Hun that you had already severed the malevolent corpse, and it didn't seem to be too difficult. Why is severing the benevolent corpse so hard?" Zi Ling asked curiously.

"Severing the corpse can be divided into two parts. The first step is to sense the existence of the three corpses within the body, and the second step is to enlighten the mind and see the nature, to comprehend the three corpses' obsession and sever them. I severed the malevolent corpse without too much effort because, firstly, in the Nine Yuan Pavilion, Ghost Spirit Child used the Corpse Severing Immortal Symbol to guide the malevolent corpse out of my body, avoiding the first step. Secondly, I had killed many people in the past, and my understanding of 'evil' was quite deep, so severing the malevolent corpse wasn't difficult. However, severing the benevolent corpse is different," Han Li said with a sigh.

"What's different?" Zi Ling asked, taken aback.

"Since I started cultivating, I've been killing continuously, and although I'm not heartless, my heart has become extremely hard. I lack understanding of the word 'benevolent'. I've been cultivating for twenty million years, and I still haven't been able to sense the existence of the benevolent corpse within my body, let alone sever it," Han Li said with a sigh.
