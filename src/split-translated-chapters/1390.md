The great calamity that had shaken the various realms finally subsided.

"Has this great disaster finally passed?"

The survivors of the various realms, gazing up at the sky that was slowly clearing, felt as if they had been transported to a different world. Their hearts were filled with a sense of wonder and awe.

Since the dawn of time, this was perhaps the most devastating disaster to have occurred, but it was not the only one. In the flow of the ages, the heavens and the earth had witnessed countless calamities.

However, in the aftermath of the disaster, a new balance was slowly established.

As the saying goes, "Without destruction, there is no creation." The arrival of a new era was often born from the ashes of the old.

...

In the depths of the Yellow Springs, the vast and endless River of Reincarnation flowed.

Gan Jiuzhen gazed out at the river, as if sensing something, and tears began to flow from her eyes.

Just then, a low, mournful cry echoed through the air, and a dark red light descended from the heavens, landing before Gan Jiuzhen. She instinctively took a step back.

But as she gazed upon the dark red light, her eyes flashed with a complex mix of emotions.

The dark red light hovered before Gan Jiuzhen, and the surrounding red glow suddenly dissipated, revealing a circular disk within. It was the Six Paths of Reincarnation, and upon its surface was a faint, ordinary-looking face.

Gan Jiuzhen slowly approached the disk, her hand reaching out to touch the face. Her expression became resolute, and she whispered, "Father, Mother, do not worry. I, Jiuzhen, will cultivate the laws of reincarnation and attain the position of Dao Ancestor. I will find a way to revive you both."

...

In the ruins of the Middle Realm, Han Li stood silently, gazing out at the horizon.

Jin Tong flew over, transforming into his human form as he stood beside Han Li.

Just then, the void where the Chaos Vortex had once been split open, and over a hundred figures flew out, stopping at a distance from Han Li.

At the forefront of the group were eight figures, each a Dao Ancestor: Li Yuanjiu, Chi Rong, Chen Ruyan, Bai Yun Daozu, the White-Robed Fat Woman from the Demon Realm, the Dry Corpse Man, the White Ze from the Savage Realm, and the Bald-Headed Giant.

Behind the eight Dao Ancestors stood several dozen cultivators, divided into three groups: the Heavenly Court, the Demon Realm, and the Savage Realm. There were no cultivators from the Gray Realm, and the three Dao Ancestors, including the True Lord of the Heavenly Court, were nowhere to be seen.

Liu Le'er and Li Qi stood behind White Ze and the Bald-Headed Giant.

The White-Robed Fat Woman and the Dry Corpse Man stood behind a group of over a dozen cultivators from the Demon Realm, including the Third Prince, Shi Po Kong, and the Fifth Princess, Shi Jingyan.

The group was battered and bruised, their faces etched with exhaustion. They looked as if they had endured immense suffering.

Han Li gazed at the group, his expression unreadable.

He had sensed their presence earlier, but they had been trapped in the spatial storm when he had absorbed the Chaos Vortex.

Li Yuanjiu and the others saw Han Li and Jin Tong standing before them, and their faces paled as they felt the overwhelming pressure emanating from Han Li.

"Daoist Han, the outcome of your battle..." White Ze finally spoke up, his voice hesitant.

"The battle is over. Gu or Jin is dead, and the Three Thousand Dao Ancestors' Array has collapsed. The great calamity has passed," Han Li replied gravely.

Upon hearing this, White Ze and the others from the Savage Realm let out a sigh of relief, while the cultivators behind them burst into cheers.

The Heavenly Court cultivators, however, wore complex expressions, their faces a mix of joy and sorrow.

Bai Yun Daozu sighed, then turned to face the remaining Heavenly Court cultivators. His heart was filled with a sense of melancholy.

He had joined the Heavenly Court in part because of Gu or Jin's promise to break through the heavenly constraints. However, he was deeply devoted to the Heavenly Court, and had worked tirelessly to cultivate its power.

Just a short time ago, the Heavenly Court had been at the height of its power, its influence stretching across the entire realm. Now, in the span of a single day, the entire core of the Heavenly Court had been reduced to nothing.

Even the remaining cultivators had only survived due to the efforts of Bai Yun Daozu and the other two Heavenly Court Dao Ancestors, who had sacrificed themselves to protect them.

The Three Thousand Dao Ancestors' Array had consumed the Dao Ancestors at an alarming rate, perhaps because they were more closely tied to the three thousand great daos of the world.

"Where is the Demon Lord?" the White-Robed Fat Woman asked.

"Where is the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation?" Li Yuanjiu asked simultaneously.

"The Demon Lord and the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation have both fallen," Han Li replied, his voice devoid of emotion. He did not reveal the true circumstances of the Demon Lord's demise to the Demon Realm cultivators.

Li Yuanjiu's face showed surprise, followed by a furrowed brow as he pondered something.

Chen Ruyan and Chi Rong's expressions also changed, their faces a mix of shock and contemplation.
The people of the Demon Realm, including the young woman in white, were surprised to hear of the Demon Lord's downfall, but they didn't show much sorrow.

Especially Shi Po Kong, Shi Jing Yan, and the handsome young prince of the Da Luo period, whose eyes flashed with a fierce desire for power.

"My father, the Demon Lord, has avenged the great injustice of our demon clan's ancestors, and his merit will be remembered for eternity! Although the primary culprit has died, the accomplices, including Bai Yun Dao Zu, still exist. Fellow daoists, let us join forces and eradicate the Heavenly Court, this poisonous tumor!" The handsome young prince exclaimed.

The others from the Demon Realm quickly responded, shouting in agreement, "Blood debts must be repaid, and the Heavenly Court must be trampled!"

Bai Ze and the bald giant's expressions changed slightly, but they didn't move, exchanging a glance with Han Li.

At this moment, they knew who held the most authority.

Bai Yun Dao Zu's face turned pale, and he swung his hand, conjuring a massive amount of white cloud energy that enveloped the ten-odd Heavenly Court cultivators behind him, sending them fleeing in all directions.

"Don't think you can escape!" A dull yellow light shot out, and the undead man from the Demon Realm chased after them.

He and the demonic woman had a close relationship, although they weren't dao companions, they had supported each other for many years. The demonic woman's death in the Three Thousand Dao God Array had filled the undead man with hatred towards the Heavenly Court.

He raised his hand, and a massive, dry claw appeared, exuding a foul stench.

The claw grabbed at the air, causing a massive collapse of the surrounding space, and a yellow spiritual domain expanded, covering Bai Yun Dao Zu and the others.

Bai Yun Dao Zu's expression changed, and he stopped in his tracks, preparing to cast a spell to defend himself.

Just then, a golden light burst forth, intervening between the two parties.

The dry claw was repelled, and the yellow spiritual domain shattered, disappearing with a loud "bang."

A figure appeared in the golden light, and it was Han Li.

Bai Yun Dao Zu's face turned pale, and he stared at Han Li in shock.

"Han Daoist, what are you doing?" the undead man asked, his face stiff.

"The True Immortal Realm has suffered greatly, and its primordial energy is severely depleted. It needs time to recover. The past is dead, and all past grievances should be forgotten. From now on, the major powers should not seek revenge or conflict. You, Dao Zu, should not take action recklessly," Han Li said, his voice calm but carrying a hint of heavenly authority.

His words were like a thunderclap, shaking the entire True Immortal Realm.

In this moment, all cultivators in the realm felt an overwhelming sense of power, as if they were being pressed down by an unseen force.

The people present trembled, their faces filled with fear.

"The Heavenly Court and our Demon Realm have settled their scores, and we will not take the initiative to provoke them again," Bai Ze and the bald giant said in unison.

Li Yuan Ji, Chi Rong, Chen Ru Yan, and the white-robed woman from the Demon Realm all nodded in agreement.

The undead man looked at Han Li, his eyes filled with a mix of fear and resignation.

"Do you have any doubts about my words?" Han Li asked, his arm still behind his back, as a massive, boundless pressure suddenly erupted, enveloping the undead man.

The undead man's face contorted, and his body began to tremble, as if he was being crushed by an invisible force.

He slowly knelt down, his eyes filled with terror.

"Han Daoist, please spare him this time," the white-robed woman begged, her voice trembling.

Han Li glanced at her, and the pressure eased slightly.

The undead man struggled to stand, his eyes filled with fear.

"It seems you understand now," Han Li said calmly, turning to the handsome young prince.

The young prince's face turned pale, and he retreated several steps, his eyes filled with fear.

"I will spare you this time, considering my past friendship with the Demon Lord. But if anyone dares to speak of provoking conflict again, they will suffer the same fate!" Han Li said, his voice cold and detached.

The surrounding space erupted in a massive explosion, and dozens of gigantic golden whirlpools appeared, spinning wildly and emitting a terrifying devouring power.

The space around them began to collapse, and everything was reduced to fine powder, swallowed by the whirlpools.

The cultivators present felt as if they were being swept away by a massive tidal wave, their bodies trembling with fear.

Some of the weaker cultivators cried out in terror, and the handsome young prince's body shook, his eyes filled with fear.

Li Yuan Ji, Chen Ru Yan, and the other Dao Zu were similarly affected, unable to control their bodies.

They could feel the whirlpools' power, which seemed to be holding back, waiting to unleash its full fury.

The time-manipulating power within the whirlpools made them realize that if they were swallowed, they would be erased from existence.
