…… 

After Lanyan left, Han Li didn't immediately close the silver light gate.

He looked at Jintong and Xiaobai, saying: "Since we're not in a hurry to leave, you two should first return to the Huazhi Cave Heaven. I'll act alone, it's more convenient that way."

Regarding Han Li's orders, Xiaobai and Jintong naturally didn't have any objections, and walked towards the light gate one after the other.

As soon as Xiaobai stepped into the light gate, he suddenly heard a loud explosion behind him, and the silver light gate closed immediately without waiting for Jintong to enter.

"What's going on?"

He quickly used his divine sense to ask Han Li, but there was no response after a while.

At the same time, the space within a hundred miles of the Linjian Pavilion was sealed off by ice, transforming into a world of ice and snow.

Han Li and Jintong stood shoulder to shoulder on the pavilion's rooftop, looking down to see the ground covered in a thick layer of ice, with ice spikes piercing the sky.

"Hmph! This guy is like a sticky plaster, can't get rid of him..." Jintong couldn't help but complain.

"Trouble can't be avoided, looks like we can't avoid a battle." Han Li sighed, looking towards the dense forest, where the ancient trees had all frozen into ice crystals, crumbling into powder.

A wide path had formed among the crumbling trees, and a woman in a green dress sat on a crystal throne shaped like a lotus flower, rushing towards them with a speed like lightning.

This woman's skin was as white as jade, her figure slender and elegant, and she was none other than the Miao Fa Xianzun who had been pursuing them.

"Thief, I've sealed off the surroundings with my spiritual domain, this time you can't escape!" Miao Fa Xianzun flew to a hundred meters away, hovering in mid-air, and shouted.

"Your sect is currently being invaded by the Wheel of Reincarnation, why not let me go and find the big fish that snuck in?" Han Li's brow furrowed, asking.

"You can rest assured, you Wheel of Reincarnation remnants who dare to invade our Jiuyuan Tower, not one of you will escape. I'll take you down first, and then I'll know what you're planning." Miao Fa Xianzun said coldly.

"Old woman, your tone is quite big, but you're not considering your own weight, daring to make such a big claim, and even saying you'll take me down, are you worthy?" Jintong's words were sharp, and he immediately scolded her.

Upon hearing this, Miao Fa Xianzun's eyebrows rose, and the killing intent in her eyes grew stronger.

"Ah, you're getting angry, but you're even uglier than before, I don't know who gave you the courage to come out and make a fool of yourself. Let my uncle teach you a lesson, and make you recognize your own worth." Jintong saw this and sneered.

"Laughable, two early-stage Mahayana realm juniors dare to be so boastful, do you know the gap between the early and middle stages?" Miao Fa Xianzun sneered.

"Heh heh, uncle, looks like she doesn't know the outcome of Guilingzi?" Jintong whispered, transmitting his voice to Han Li.

"I don't know, that's for the best, we don't have much time, we need to find a way to take her down quickly." Han Li replied.

As soon as he finished speaking, Han Li snapped his fingers, and a golden light screen expanded, covering the surrounding area within a hundred miles, slowing down the flow of time in the virtual space.

The next instant, he took a step forward, and a loud explosion sounded, causing the pavilion to collapse instantly.

Han Li's figure flashed in the smoke, and then disappeared, leaving behind only a whirlwind.

Miao Fa Xianzun's eyes flashed, and without even making a seal, the crystal throne beneath her burst into light, shooting out hundreds of lotus petal crystals, flying towards all directions.

Han Li's figure had just appeared behind her, when the lotus petal crystals faced him, their light bursting forth, releasing a wave of extreme cold, freezing the surrounding space.

Han Li had detected something was off, but his body was a step too slow.

His calf was frozen into an ice pillar, and the frozen pillar was surprisingly heavy, causing Han Li to be dragged down towards the ice spike.

Han Li punched downwards, striking the ground.

A powerful fist force exploded, shattering the ice spikes on the ground, and his body borrowed the recoil to fly upwards, returning to mid-air.

Immediately after, a silver flame flashed on his calf, covering it with a layer of silver fire, quickly dissolving the ice pillar.

But at this moment, a huge six-sided snowflake crystal suddenly enveloped him from above, its blue light flashing, refracting six blue lights, forming six white crystal walls, surrounding him.

Han Li looked at the familiar crystal walls, and couldn't help but sigh, earlier he had said he wouldn't fall for the same trick again, but now he was trapped once more.

At this time, the crystal walls above him burst into a cold light, reflecting his shadow.

Looking at the six people in the reflection, each with different expressions, Han Li didn't rush to act, instead, he twisted his wrist, and a Qingtong Fengyun sword appeared in his palm.

The reflection in the crystal walls didn't move, nor did it reflect the Qingtong Fengyun sword.
Han Li saw this situation and felt a slight sense of relief in his heart. It seemed that the Mirror of Illusions could only replicate his own reflection, and would not copy his magical artifacts.

As he thought about this, he pinched his fingers together in a sword seal, and his long sword flashed with golden light. The sword's body burst forth with golden electricity, transforming into a golden dragon that coiled around his body and shot upwards into the air.

The six reflections around him also moved in response to his actions, but they were all empty-handed, throwing punches at Han Li instead of wielding swords.

Han Li's body transformed in an instant, turning into a three-headed, six-armed demonic form. He used his fists and claws to resist the attacks of the six reflections.

Just as the reflections were about to attack again, a loud explosion sounded from above, and the golden dragon broke through the snowflake ice crystal.

The snowflake ice crystal shattered under the force of the impact, and two of the six ice spires broke off and flew outwards. The six silver mirrors also disappeared, and Han Li's figure reappeared.

Miao Fa Xian Zun was shocked by this scene. The last time she had used this technique to trap Han Li, he had been unable to resist, but this time he had broken free in an instant.

However, there was no fear in her eyes. She stood up from the lotus throne, took a step forward, and appeared in the void. The ice crystal throne rotated and descended to the ground.

With a flick of her wrist, a blue longsword appeared in her hand, its body glowing with blue spiritual energy. It was clearly a high-grade magical artifact.

"There's also that other person, don't hide anymore, come out together," Miao Fa Xian Zun said, her eyes scanning the area in front of her.

But there was no response.

"Jin Tong is naturally timid, Miao Fa, don't scare her," Han Li said with a smile.

Miao Fa's eyes twitched at his words. Jin Tong was known for her bravery, and it was ridiculous to call her timid.

"It doesn't matter, if she doesn't want to come out, then I'll invite her out," Miao Fa Xian Zun said coldly.

As she spoke, her longsword trembled and flew out of her hand, soaring into the air.

She quickly pinched her fingers together in a seal, and a cold mist erupted from the sky, covering the area in a thick layer of fog.

Han Li was enveloped by the mist, and his hand felt a chill as a layer of frost formed on his sword.

He looked up to see a blue glow flashing in the distance, and a figure descended from the sky.

In an instant, countless blue sword lights appeared, transforming into a blue sword rain that poured down from the sky, heading straight for Han Li.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he activated his time manipulation powers. A golden light burst forth, and a round moon appeared in the sky, emitting countless golden rays of light that seemed to solidify the air itself.

However, the blue sword rain continued to fall, unaffected by the time manipulation powers.

Han Li's eyes flashed with a purple glow, and he realized that the sword rain was being protected by a layer of frost that was immune to his powers.

In an instant, the sword rain fell upon him, and Han Li could only grit his teeth and swing his sword upwards to meet the attack.

A loud crash sounded, and the sword rain continued to fall, pressing down on the golden light bridge that Han Li had created.

Finally, the golden light bridge shattered, and the sword rain continued to fall, covering the entire area in a thick layer of blue ice crystals.

But when Miao Fa looked around, she couldn't find Han Li's figure anywhere.

Just as she was about to search for him, a sudden change occurred...
