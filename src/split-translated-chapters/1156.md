Han Li's gaze fell upon the five remaining colorful flames on top of the Silver Flame Dwarf's head, and he couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt.

Earlier, when he was trapped in the Nine Dragon Godfire, it was the refined flames of the Phoenix Bird that had used up two of the seven-colored fire sands to protect him, allowing him to communicate with the Bottle Spirit and eventually achieve bodily transcendence.

Han Li felt a pang of regret, but the Phoenix Bird seemed to be unbothered, and continued to jump and play in his palm, appearing to be very happy.

"I'll definitely make up for what was lost," Han Li said, using his divine sense to communicate with the Phoenix Bird.

The Silver Flame Dwarf standing on his palm seemed to understand Han Li's words and nodded heavily.

Han Li then raised his hand and used his divine sense to capture the dog-shaped black stone, lifting it into the air.

The Phoenix Bird, sensing Han Li's intentions, flew out and transformed into a silver flame, enveloping the black stone.

As the layers of silver flames burned and refined the black stone, it began to emit black smoke, and its surface began to melt like ice.

The black color on the stone's surface grew thinner, and it seemed to be stripped away layer by layer, revealing the object inside.

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise as he watched the stone's surface become thinner and thinner.

After a moment, the outer layer of the black stone was completely melted away, revealing a crystal-like object inside, and within the crystal, a small white-furred beast was curled up.

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise as he recognized the small beast, and he exclaimed, "Little White!"

The small beast inside the crystal was none other than the Pixiu, Little White, who had accompanied the Golden Boy to the Great Jin Yuan Immortal Realm.

Sang Tu and the others were shocked, their expressions changing in surprise.

Han Li, however, didn't notice, and instead instructed the Phoenix Bird to melt away the last layer of crystal, and then gently lifted the small white beast into his arms.

However, even after the crystal was melted away, Little White remained motionless, its eyes closed, and it seemed to be lifeless.

Han Li's eyes scanned Little White's body, and his divine sense probed its surroundings.

It was only then that he discovered that Little White's soul was still in a state of deep sleep, sealed by a power inherent to its bloodline, trapped in a state of pseudo-death.

Han Li knew that this was a self-protection mechanism that Little White had activated, and his worries were alleviated, but he didn't know how to wake it up.

The Phoenix Bird, seeing Han Li's concerned expression, didn't disturb him, and instead flew to his shoulder, its light flashing before disappearing.

Han Li took a deep breath, calming down, and began to use his Refining God technique to enter Little White's divine sea, attempting to awaken it.

However, when he entered Little White's divine sea, he found that it was pitch black, and he couldn't see anything.

Moreover, Han Li felt that there was a strange power in the darkness, pulling his divine sense deeper into the blackness.

Han Li's alarm grew, and he quickly withdrew his divine sense, retreating from Little White's divine sea.

After a moment of hesitation, he once again used his Refining God technique, this time trying to awaken Little White through their previous heart-to-heart connection.

However, when his divine sense touched Little White's body, Han Li suddenly felt the surroundings darken, and he was enveloped in a black void, just like when he was inside Little White's divine sea.

In the darkness, a pair of giant, glowing eyes appeared, their gaze icy and detached, falling upon Han Li.

Han Li was caught off guard, and before he could react, his divine sense was interrupted, and he was jolted back to reality.

"How could this be...?" Han Li muttered, his mind reeling in shock.

"Can you wake him up?" Sang Tu asked.

"This beast is an old friend of mine," Han Li said, shaking his head. "I don't know why, but its divine sea is pitch black, and when I enter it, I'm met with a pair of glowing eyes that seem to be watching me, making it impossible to awaken it."

"Black divine sea, glowing eyes... Could this beast be a descendant of the ancient, barbaric Eight Kings, the Ink-Eyed Pixiu?" Yun Bao exclaimed, his expression changing in surprise.

Sang Tu's expression also changed.

"The Ink-Eyed Pixiu?" Han Li asked, puzzled.

"According to legend, the Ink-Eyed Pixiu clan possesses the strongest spiritual eyes in the world, allowing them to see through illusions and discern the true nature of reality," Yun Bao explained. "They can also see through the cycles of reincarnation and predict the birth of heaven-defying treasures. It's said that their eyes can even see through the void and predict the fate of the universe."
Han Li's expression changed slightly upon hearing the words, and he thought back to the time when Xian'er had discovered the secret realm's treasure. Although Xian'er did have a special ability, it was not as mystical as Yun Bao had described. As for seeing through illusions and reincarnation, it was simply nonsense.

"Not only that, the double eyes of the Mokeye Pixiu can connect to a mysterious space. When its cultivation is strong enough, it can capture its enemies with a single glance. Unless one's power far surpasses theirs, it's impossible to escape that kind of space." Yun Bao continued.

"Xian'er's belly does seem to have a special space that can isolate external probing, and when absorbing others, it requires opening its mouth to devour. But I've never seen any connection to its eyes." Han Li pondered for a moment before speaking.

"Ah, it seems that the Mokeye Pixiu's tribe's abilities were indeed too mysterious. After the Mokeye Pixiu King, who was a True Spirit King, disappeared, the entire tribe was annihilated. To this day, it's rare to see any of their bloodline descendants remaining. If we bring Xian'er to the Eight Desolate Mountains, we'll definitely be viewed as treasures by the entire Desolate Tribe. There, the True Spirit King will certainly be able to awaken him." Sang Tu sighed and spoke.

Han Li's eyes flashed with a hint of hesitation upon hearing this.

He had originally planned to find a quiet place to close his eyes and cultivate, waiting until he had achieved a breakthrough and could advance to the early stages of the Mahayana, and at the same time, his Time Dao Mark would recover. He would then immediately head to the Great Jin Yuan Xian Domain to hibernate and wait for the Wheel of Reincarnation Temple's actions.

However, he had now encountered Xian'er by mistake, and he had to reconsider his plans.

After thinking for a moment, Han Li decided to first save Xian'er. Once Xian'er awoke, he would ask about the Jiuyuan Observatory and then follow the Wheel of Reincarnation Temple's actions. He would have a greater chance of rescuing the Golden Boy.

"Since the only way to save Xian'er is to go to the Eight Desolate Mountains, I'm willing to accompany you and protect him on the way." Han Li said.

Sang Tu and Yun Bao's expressions changed upon hearing this.

"We, the Silver Horned Rhinoceros Tribe, will provide sufficient protection." Sang Tu said first.

Yun Bao, on the other hand, coldly snorted and said nothing.

After all, Xian'er was found by the Silver Horned Rhinoceros Tribe, and he was currently staying with them.

"Sang Tu, I have a question for you. Are you planning to relocate the entire tribe to the Eight Desolate Mountains and protect Xian'er?" Han Li asked, his expression unchanged.

"Ah, of course not. We'll just bring a few of our strongest warriors." Sang Tu replied, slightly hesitant.

"If that's the case, you'll be taking away the tribe's most important fighting force. What about the remaining tribe members? The Cloud Patterned Tiger Tribe's main forces are still here." Han Li raised an eyebrow and asked with a smile.

As soon as he spoke, Sang Tu immediately understood the implication, and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead.

If Han Li were to do this, the Cloud Patterned Tiger Tribe would definitely take advantage of the situation and attack the Silver Horned Rhinoceros Tribe, annihilating them before they could return with glory from the Eight Desolate Mountains.

Even if Sang Tu were to receive rewards and support from the Eight Desolate Mountains for his services, his tribe would already be gone.

"I'm willing to work with the Cloud Patterned Tiger Tribe to escort Xian'er back to the Eight Desolate Mountains." Sang Tu said sincerely.

Yun Bao's expression turned solemn, and he cast a grateful glance at Han Li.

"Not only that, but when you leave, the two tribes will be leaderless, and it's only a matter of time before news leaks out, and you'll be targeted by other tribes. Therefore, you must not only put aside your past grievances and not attack each other, but also provide support when one side is in trouble. This is the only way to ensure that both tribes can survive in the long run." Han Li continued.

Sang Tu and Yun Bao's faces flashed with a hint of difficulty.

The others in the tent were also in a similar state, with a century of accumulated resentment that couldn't be easily forgotten.

The two tribes wouldn't abandon their hatred and make peace just because of Han Li's words.

"Actually, you don't have to be too hard on yourselves. It's not like you have to do this forever. Just hold on until you've participated in the Eight Desolate Mountains' Blood Sacrifice Conference and returned. After that, you can do as you please." Han Li smiled and said.

Sang Tu and Yun Bao remained silent for a long time before nodding in unison.

"Thank you, Senior, for your advice. We'll do as you say."

"No need to call me Senior. Just call me Shi Mu or Shi Dao Friend. By the way, when is the Blood Sacrifice Conference?" Han Li asked.

"It was announced thirty years ago, and it's said to be a hundred-year event. There's less than seventy years left. The journey to the Eight Desolate Mountains is long, and time is not on our side, so we should set out soon." Sang Tu replied.

"Then, you should return to your tribes and make arrangements for the tribe's affairs, choose the best warriors to escort Xian'er, and we'll set out soon." Han Li said, now acting as the leader of the two tribes.

"Good." Sang Tu and Yun Bao replied in unison.

After they left, Sang Tu ordered the camp to be temporarily set up as Han Li's residence, and no one was allowed to approach without permission.

Han Li sat alone in the tent for a moment before opening the Flower Branch Cave Heaven.

He then picked up Xian'er and stepped through the silver gate, entering the Bamboo Pavilion inside the cave heaven.
