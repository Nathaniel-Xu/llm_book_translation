As Han Li's body was surrounded by the flashing golden lights, the True Speech Treasure Wheel, the Time Cleansing Bottle, the Phantom Hourglass, the Eastern Yi Divine Tree, the Time-Cutting Torch, and the five objects that had taken shape appeared one by one, slowly revolving around his body.

Threads of time law crystals emerged from the True Speech Treasure Wheel and other objects, intertwining to form a golden whirlpool that rapidly spun around.

Han Li took a deep breath, reciting incantations as he manipulated the spell seals, causing the golden whirlpool to suddenly shrink inward.

A powerful surge of time law fluctuations flashed by, and the golden whirlpool let out a cracking sound as all the golden light and law crystals collapsed inward, forming a golden ring.

Han Li had done this many times before, but this time seemed different.

As he condensed the golden ring, the text of the "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique" flowed clearly from his heart, more vivid than ever before.

He had a deeper understanding of the profound meaning of time law that this technique described.

The time law power within Han Li stirred, as if it was about to undergo some transformation, but the sudden flash of insight in his mind disappeared, and the changes in the law power ceased.

"What's going on?" Han Li wondered, but after a moment of intense contemplation, he couldn't grasp the answer, so he simply stopped thinking about it and raised his hand to push the golden ring forward.

The golden ring shot out, rapidly expanding several times its original size, and with a soft "click," it enveloped a bug nest.

The ring spun rapidly, emitting a low, rumbling sound like a divine being's gentle hum, and a dazzling golden light burst forth, like a blaze of golden flames.

A powerful suction force emerged from within the ring, wrapping around the bug nest.

The Fire Age bug nest was engulfed by the golden flames, emitting a crackling sound like burning, and bursts of golden light shot out from the nest, merging into the golden ring.

The ring trembled slightly, shooting out a golden crystal thread that swirled around Han Li's body before flying towards the Time-Cutting Torch.

Han Li watched as the golden crystal thread wrapped around the torch, and he continued to accelerate the technique.

The golden light emanating from the ring grew denser, rapidly extracting the time law power from the bug nest and transforming it into time law crystals.

Thread after thread of time law crystals shot out from the golden ring, flying towards the Time-Cutting Torch, and the Fire Age bug nest rapidly shrunk, disappearing in an instant.

Fifty-two threads of time law crystals swirled around the Time-Cutting Torch, emitting a powerful and concentrated time law fluctuation.

Han Li's heart settled slightly as he watched this scene.

His calculations had been correct; the bug nest's time law power was not inferior to his own, and he had successfully condensed so many threads of time law crystals.

The number of law crystals suddenly doubled, and Han Li felt his entire body filled with time law power, a sensation completely different from before.

Han Li even felt that he had enough time law power to cast the "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique" at will.

The True Speech Treasure Wheel and other objects, which had been subdued due to previous events, had recovered somewhat over the past two days, but now, with the increased number of law crystals and the surge of time law power, they were fully restored, shining even brighter than before.

Especially the Time-Cutting Torch, which not only shone with golden light but also seemed to have grown slightly larger.

Han Li suppressed his excitement, took a deep breath, and manipulated the spell seals once more.

The golden ring shot out again, enveloping another bug nest.

A dazzling golden light burst forth from the ring, wrapping around the nest and extracting its time law power.

Time passed rapidly, and in the blink of an eye, half an hour had passed.

The other two bug nests were also absorbed by the golden ring, transformed into over a hundred threads of time law crystals.

At this moment, the Time-Cutting Torch was wrapped in a total of one hundred and sixty threads of time law crystals.

The Time-Cutting Torch had grown about 30% larger and had a sense of solidity to it.

The surging time law power within Han Li was three to four times stronger than before.

The sudden increase in time law power made it difficult for Han Li to control, but he didn't feel any discomfort, only an overwhelming urge to let out a mighty roar.

He managed to suppress this urge, put away the True Speech Treasure Wheel and other objects, and sat down to circulate the "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique," gathering the time law power within his body.

About two to three hours later, Han Li stood up again, his body filled with time law power, which he could now control with ease.

Although he hadn't tried, he was confident that he could cast the technique with the abundant time law power within him.

"Ah, I wonder what's happening outside," Han Li muttered to himself, glancing at the wailing spirit.

The wailing spirit was still refining its ghostly energy, so Han Li didn't disturb it, and with a swift motion, he left the flower branch space and entered the outer hall.

He waved his hand, sending out a burst of green light that swept across the hall, causing the various array flags and disks to fly back and hover before him.

Han Li waved his sleeve, collecting the array flags and disks, and then pushed open the door to enter the main hall.
As soon as he entered the hall, dazzling blue and crimson light filled the space, accompanied by thunderous roars that shook the heart.

He was taken aback for a moment, and then he saw the situation inside the hall.

On the floor of the main hall, a massive blue square array was drawn, with seven ring-shaped symbols arranged in an arc shape within the array.

At this moment, apart from the still-unrecovered Lan Yu Zi and Su Zhong Qian, the other seven people, including Lan Lian, Lei Yu Ce, Wen Zhong, the black-clad couple, Jin Liu, and Xiong Shan, sat in the ring-shaped symbols, manipulating the blue array.

Lan Yu Zi and Su Zhong Qian stood outside the blue array, vigilantly looking around, as if guarding against a sudden attack.

"Stone friend, you're out..." Su Zhong Qian saw Han Li emerge, and a hint of joy appeared on her face as she greeted him.

But she suddenly stopped mid-sentence, sizing Han Li up and down, her beautiful eyes revealing a hint of surprise.

In the short half-day they had been apart, something huge seemed to have changed about Han Li, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it.

Lan Yu Zi's face showed an unnatural expression when he saw Han Li.

Han Li nodded to the two of them, looking towards the blue array.

Lan Lian and the others rapidly manipulated the array, and intense blue light burst forth, shooting towards the crimson glow at the back of the hall.

The light was accompanied by countless blue symbols, and the water law flowed within, pouring into the crimson glow.

The sound of muffled explosions echoed out, like the roar of a tidal wave, and the crimson glow fluctuated wildly.

"Roar!"

The glow emitted a series of fierce howls, and seven clusters of dazzling crimson light emerged, along with the seven evil spirits. They raised their hands, releasing a thick, blood-like glow that was filled with malevolent energy, striking the blue light and immediately repelling it.

Moreover, the blood-like glow tore apart the blue light, striking the blue array itself.

However, Lan Lian's expression didn't change, as if everything was going according to plan.

She recited a incantation, her hands rapidly changing into seven or eight different hand seals, and then she drew a line on her wrist.

With a "hiss," two streams of blood shot out from her wrist, merging into the blue array.

The blue array's color suddenly changed, transforming into a deep crimson in an instant, and the law fluctuations it emitted also changed, shifting from the water law to the blood law.

"Ah!" Han Li's eyes widened as he exclaimed.

He had never seen such a change in the law before.

The seven evil spirits' attacks struck the crimson array, but instead of causing any harm, they were immediately absorbed into it.

At the same time, a series of blood-like tendrils shot out from the array, instantly wrapping around the seven evil spirits.

Lan Lian and the others rapidly changed their hand seals, and the crimson array suddenly brightened, transforming the blood-like tendrils into seven crimson rings that encircled the evil spirits.

The rings emitted a powerful restrictive force, immobilizing the evil spirits and rendering them unable to move.

Lan Lian's face showed a hint of joy, and she swiftly raised her hand.

A crimson token appeared in front of her, spinning rapidly as it released a burst of blood-like silk, which was actually the blood law crystal threads. There were over fifty or sixty threads, which merged into the crimson array.

The crimson array began to rumble loudly once more, and a series of enormous blood-like symbols, each over a meter in diameter, shot out from the array, striking the evil spirits' crimson glow.

The glow immediately began to shake violently, and the interior seemed to be exploding, rapidly becoming thinner.

The seven evil spirits seemed to sense the threat, and they let out a collective roar, their bodies emitting a layer of liquid-like blood light.

A fierce, malevolent energy burst forth from the evil spirits, far surpassing the previous one. It was accompanied by a dark, evil law that directly invaded the minds of the people present, rendering their protective laws useless.

Han Li was also affected by this energy, his vision turning red as he seemed to see an endless sea of blood, mountains of corpses, and fields of white bones...

However, at this moment, the time law within him automatically activated, driving out the evil law and restoring his clarity of mind.

Although he quickly recovered, the others were unable to do so.

Xiong Shan's eyes turned a deep crimson, and his body began to tremble uncontrollably, emitting a powerful, murderous aura. It seemed that he had been controlled by the evil energy.

Jin Liu, Wen Zhong, and the heavily injured Lan Yu Zi's eyes also turned crimson, and they let out low, beast-like growls. However, their eyes still retained a hint of clarity, and they were not completely under control.

Lan Lian, Su Zhong Qian, and Lei Yu Ce were the strongest, and they were the least affected. They began to release their own law energies, driving out the evil energy from their bodies.

Han Li ignored the others, his eyes fixed on the black-clad couple within the array.

The two of them were still motionless, their faces hidden behind their masks.
