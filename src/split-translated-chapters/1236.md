As Guī Lín Zǐ watched Qū Lín escape, he only flashed a moment of interest, but ultimately didn't pursue him.

Compared to a Niè Jīn immortal, what attracted him more was Hàn Lì.

After all, from the various messages sent back earlier, it was almost certain that the Zhuàn Tiān Píng was on Hàn Lì's body.

At this moment, the most awkward one was Lán Yuàn.

As a disciple of the Jiǔ Yuán Guān, she was helping an outsider invade her own sect, and Hàn Lì was the only hope to save Lán Yuàn's life, so she had to help.

"Tsk, tsk, eating the inside and peeling the outside, you're more despicable than an outsider thief." Guī Lín Zǐ's gaze fell on Lán Yuàn, and he said with a sinister tone.

Lán Yuàn had no way to defend herself, and could only tightly bite her lower lip, not daring to speak.

At this point, she had no choice but to follow Hàn Lì's lead.

Facing a Dà Luó Zhōng Qī cultivator, Hàn Lì naturally didn't dare to be arrogant, and after a slight hesitation, he cupped his hands and said:

"Senior, I didn't come to your sect to cause trouble, I just want to retrieve my spiritual pet. Now that your sect is under attack, it's the perfect opportunity for you to take action and turn the tide. Why not let me go and catch the big fish that's threatening your sect? I passed by the Jīn Yù Guān on my way here, and there are many people from the Lún Huí Diàn there."

Guī Lín Zǐ heard this, but only gave him a cold glance, and didn't seem interested in responding. Instead, he seemed to be considering how to deal with the two intruders.

Hàn Lì naturally didn't think that a few words could dismiss Guī Lín Zǐ, so while speaking, his eyes shone with a purple light, and he scanned the surroundings, secretly accumulating his spiritual energy to find a way to escape.

After scanning the area, he saw that the stone room was dark and gloomy, with faint flames illuminating the walls, which were carved with strange and eerie symbols, resembling blood vessels.

Guī Lín Zǐ walked around the perimeter of the room, then suddenly raised his hands, pinched a spell, and began to chant. The sound of his voice echoed in the room, accompanied by a faint, eerie sound.

As his voice resonated, Hàn Lì's mind suddenly felt a sharp pain, and he became dazed.

The sound of water flowing and a thick, bloody aura filled the room.

"Shén Hún Fǎ Zé?" Hàn Lì's mind was shocked, and he felt something was off.

He quickly activated his Liàn Shén Shù, and a loud "crackling" sound erupted, as a golden electric light burst forth, enveloping his body. The black light that bound him began to dissolve.

However, Lán Yuàn's eyes turned empty and distant, her face twisted in pain.

Hàn Lì's brow furrowed, and he shouted at Lán Yuàn. A crystal light burst forth from his brow, striking Lán Yuàn's forehead, and several golden lightning snakes wrapped around her body, dispelling the black light.

"Ah..." she groaned, and collapsed to the ground, before suddenly waking up.

"Bié Xié Shén Léi... and Liàn Shén Shù, those Heavenly Court inspectors are blind? They actually let you cultivate Liàn Shén Shù to this extent. But it's good, today I've stumbled upon a rare opportunity." Guī Lín Zǐ didn't seem to be talking to Hàn Lì, but rather to himself, his eyes occasionally flashing with a sinister smile.

After speaking, he nodded to himself, as if making a decision.

Hàn Lì didn't know what Guī Lín Zǐ meant by "opportunity," but judging by his expression, it was clear that it was different from his own understanding. Such a fate, he didn't want.

Just then, he suddenly realized that Guī Lín Zǐ had stopped chanting, but the eerie sounds still lingered, growing louder and more intense.

The bloody aura in the room didn't dissipate, but instead grew thicker.

"Brother Hàn, we're done for... we've entered Guī Lín Zǐ's Wàn Líng Xiàn Jiàn, this time we're dead for sure." Lán Yuàn's face turned pale as she spoke.

"Wàn Líng Xiàn Jiàn... this place is filled with yīn energy, where's the spiritual energy? I think it's more like a Wàn Guǐ Jiàn." Hàn Lì's brow furrowed, and he thought to himself.

He glanced around, and saw that the black crystal pillars surrounding them had suddenly appeared with eerie, ghostly faces, stacked on top of each other, making his skin crawl.

Among them were human-like and yāo-like faces, all with eyes open wide, mouths agape, and twisted in anger.

The sound of their whispers was like a gentle breeze, but it was actually a cacophony of wailing voices, each one a snowflake, accumulating and growing, until it became an avalanche that would crush everything.

Hàn Lì's mind suddenly had an idea, and he felt a sense of unease.

These wailing voices, each one a snowflake, accumulating and growing, would eventually become a snowstorm that would crush everything. Even Liàn Shén Shù might not be able to withstand it.

"Immediately seal your hearing, and destroy these crystal pillars." he shouted, his brow furrowed.

Lán Yuàn didn't hesitate, and immediately followed his instructions.
Just as she closed her ears with her spiritual energy, she discovered that the sound lingering around her ears didn't decrease in the slightest, but instead seemed to resonate directly within her heart lake, becoming even clearer.

Her heart skipped a beat, but she didn't have time to react, gripping a blue longsword in her hand as she charged forward and slashed at a black crystal pillar in front of her.

Ghost Spirit saw their actions and didn't show any signs of stopping them, simply observing with cold eyes.

Lan Yan's heart "thudded" as she released her sword's edge, transforming into hundreds of sharp blue sword lights that descended upon the black crystal pillar.

Without warning, a loud explosion sounded, and Lan Yan's sword lights fell upon the pillar, only to be swallowed by the black crystal's flashing light, as if they had been chopped into cotton.

Before Lan Yan could even react, a loud "rumble" echoed from a short distance away.

She quickly turned her head to see Han Li grasping a sword seal, directing dozens of flying swords wrapped in golden lightning as they transformed into thousands of golden sword lights, slashing down upon the black crystal pillars.

The golden lightning reflected off each other, creating a deafening roar that shook the surroundings, making it seem as if a heavenly tribulation had descended upon the area.

Ghost Spirit's face changed upon seeing this, clearly not expecting this sudden turn of events.

The next instant, a thunderous boom shook the air, making Lan Yan's ears ache.

The dark stone chamber was suddenly illuminated by a golden light, as if a golden sun had risen, and the golden lightning engulfed everything.

Unlike Lan Yan's sword lights, Han Li's seventy-two green bamboo swords passed through the black crystal pillars, causing them to shatter and explode.

However, instead of crystal shards flying out, the shattered pillars transformed into a ghostly mist that spread out, releasing a cacophony of wailing spirits.

Ghost Spirit's face changed, and Han Li's eyes revealed a hint of excitement.

He raised his hands, and his sword seal changed, as a "zizzling" sound erupted.

The ghostly mist was suddenly swept away by a wave of golden lightning, as if golden spiders were stretching out their legs, transforming into lightning spears that struck the ghostly mist, dispersing it.

The ghostly mist's wailing sounds were disrupted by the thunder.

"Is this a bit wasteful?" Han Li furrowed his brow, muttering to himself.

As soon as he spoke, a sudden change occurred.

The wall in front of them suddenly glowed with a bloody light, as a massive ghostly face emerged from the bloodstains, opening its mouth to devour the surroundings.

A massive blood-red vortex appeared, sucking in the golden lightning released by Han Li's green bamboo swords.

The green bamboo swords, infused with the power of thunder, should have been the bane of all ghostly creatures. However, in this situation, it seemed to have the opposite effect.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he hastily raised his hand to recall his swords.

But before he could, a blood-red tongue darted out of the ghostly mouth, wrapping around half of the green bamboo swords and pulling them into the blood-red vortex.

Han Li only managed to recall a small portion of the swords, merging them into a single entity that he grasped in his hand, while the rest flew into the blood-red vortex, beyond his control.

As the golden lightning disappeared, the ghostly creatures that emerged from the crystal pillars were no longer suppressed, and they surged forward as a ghostly tide, engulfing Han Li and Lan Yan.

Lan Yan quickly waved her hand, and a blue, spherical light screen expanded, transforming into a water-attribute spiritual domain that spanned a thousand feet.

The ghostly creatures that entered the domain were like fish in water, being battered by waves of blue, watery energy that blocked their advance.

However, as more and more ghostly creatures emerged from the black crystal pillars, the ghostly tide grew stronger, pressing in on Han Li and Lan Yan from all sides.

Finally, Lan Yan's domain was breached, and the ghostly creatures surged forward, engulfing them.

Just as all seemed lost, a faint golden light erupted, and Han Li's time domain suddenly expanded, encompassing the ghostly creatures.

Unlike in Lan Yan's domain, where the ghostly creatures could still advance through sheer numbers, in Han Li's domain, they were frozen in place, unable to move.
