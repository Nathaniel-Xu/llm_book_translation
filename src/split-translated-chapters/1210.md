Han Li's body was quickly drained of its spiritual energy, but the devouring force did not stop, instead it continued to squeeze out his body's thick blood force, and then devour it.

He gritted his teeth and struggled to hold on, but the surrounding spiritual realm did not dissipate even though his spiritual energy was depleted. The devouring force instead grew stronger, as if it would not rest until it had sucked him dry.

"No!" Han Li's heart tightened, and he was about to take out the spiritual stones and put them back near the Guang Yin Tian Xuan great array.

But just as he was about to do so, a sudden change occurred!

The surrounding spiritual realm suddenly fluctuated, and a powerful devouring force several times stronger than before enveloped him, seeping into his body and penetrating his meridians.

Han Li's body immediately became stiff, and he couldn't even move a finger.

"What's going on!" he exclaimed, trying to mobilize his body's energy, but to no avail.

His body's blood force was quickly devoured, and his body began to weaken, his mind becoming cloudy and disoriented, as if he was about to fall asleep.

Tie Xuan saw this and, although she didn't know what was happening, she felt that Han Li's situation was not good.

"Master!" she cried out, rushing towards Han Li.

But just as she did, a strong golden light burst out of Han Li's body, forming a turbulent golden wave that sent Tie Xuan flying.

Innumerable golden lights burst out of Han Li's body, surging wildly in all directions.

At this moment, Han Li's eyes were closed, and he seemed to be in a half-dream, half-awake state.

"Whoosh!" The golden lights suddenly reversed direction and formed a golden sphere about a zhang high, enveloping Han Li.

Innumerable golden symbols danced around the sphere, emitting a sense of completion and perfection, repelling the devouring force emanating from the spiritual realm.

Han Li's body, which had been rapidly losing its blood force, suddenly stopped, and he jolted awake.

He steadied himself and looked at the golden sphere surrounding him, a hint of surprise in his eyes.

The next moment, a profound and mysterious law of the universe flowed into his mind from the golden sphere.

Han Li's mind was like a thunderclap, as the entire Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue cultivation technique flowed through his mind, along with the words of advice from Mi Luo Old Ancestor, and his own past insights and understandings of the technique.

All these insights merged into one, forming a complete whole.

"The Five Elements revolve, endless and unceasing..." Han Li's eyes were half-open, half-closed, and he pushed his right hand forward.

A thick golden light burst out of his palm, containing a multitude of time law crystals.

Han Li had collected various materials to refine the time law crystals, and after advancing to the Da Luo realm, he had produced many more. Now, he had a total of 330 time law crystals.

The golden light swirled and converged on a single point, and the time law crystals wrapped around it.

A powerful time law fluctuation erupted, and the golden light and crystals disappeared, transforming into a golden sphere the size of a human head, radiating boundless time law fluctuations.

The golden sphere flew out and merged with the surrounding spiritual realm.

The entire spiritual realm violently shook, and the Guang Yin Tian Xuan great array stopped operating.

Han Li's vision blurred, and he found himself back in the flower branch space.

The golden sphere surrounding him had disappeared, and he collapsed to the ground, panting heavily.

At this moment, his face was deathly pale, but his eyes shone with joy.

He had finally escaped from that space.

The golden sphere formed by the time law seemed to be the legendary ultimate form of the law, the Law Sphere.

Mi Luo Old Ancestor had once told Han Li that the law had several forms, including law crystals, law rings, and the ultimate form, the Law Sphere.

Only by truly understanding the law to a high level could one display the divine power of the Law Sphere.

Who would have thought that he would attain this level after his narrow escape?

"Master, are you okay? I was scared to death!" Tie Xuan rushed over and supported Han Li's body.

Han Li nodded to Tie Xuan, indicating that he was fine, and then took out two recovery pills and swallowed them, followed by cultivating to refine the medicinal energy.

Tie Xuan saw that Han Li was weak and didn't continue to cultivate, instead sitting down to guard him.

The heaven and earth energy in the flower branch space converged towards Han Li, and at the same time, a multitude of heaven and earth energies from the outside space permeated the flower branch space.

Not only that, but various other energies, including fire, lightning, wood, and demonic energy, also flowed into his body.

A Da Luo realm cultivator's control over the heaven and earth energy was far more refined than before.

Da Luo, the realm of eternal freedom and containment of all space.

This realm was no trivial matter!
Han Li slowly opened his eyes, his face restored to its normal color, and the energy of his body had fully recovered.

After advancing to the Great Luo realm, he could now absorb the energy of the heavens and earth, and his injuries healed at an incredible rate. Moreover, the East Elixir Divine Tree had merged with the Two Life Tree, allowing him to recover even more quickly.

The Two Life Tree seemed to have a restorative effect on physical injuries, and the East Elixir Divine Tree had inherited this property, which greatly benefited Han Li.

"Master, what happened earlier? Are you alright?" Qī Hún asked with concern.

"It's nothing, I just set up a new time-space difference, and it wasn't fully stable, causing a backlash. But it didn't cause any significant damage, just consuming a lot of my energy. I've fully recovered now," Han Li replied, not explaining the details to Qī Hún.

Qī Hún let out a sigh of relief. "As long as you're alright, that's all that matters."

Han Li smiled and turned to look at the distant Flower Branch Space. He raised his hand, and two golden lights shot out, enveloping Xiao Bai and the Jing Yan Tong Zi, bringing them to his side.

Han Li's control over his powers was now extremely refined, and Xiao Bai and the Jing Yan Tong Zi didn't even notice they had been moved. They continued to cultivate as usual.

Han Li waved his hand, and the Time Spirit Domain opened once more. The Light Shadow Heavenly Array combined with the domain, creating a time-space difference of a million times.

As the domain enveloped Xiao Bai, he suddenly became aware of his surroundings and looked around in surprise.

The Jing Yan Tong Zi was still refining the Three-Legged Golden Crow's demon core, completely absorbed in his cultivation.

"This is my new time-space difference, where time flows at a rate a million times faster than the outside world. You'll both cultivate here from now on," Han Li said calmly.

"A million times faster? That means if we cultivate for a million years here, only one year will pass in the outside world?" Xiao Bai exclaimed in shock.

"Master has recently grasped this divine ability, so let's go cultivate elsewhere and not disturb him," Qī Hún said, leading Xiao Bai to the side.

Han Li closed his eyes, calmed his mind, and began to circulate the "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique".

He had been busy with various matters, especially the time-space difference, which had been troubling his mind.

Now that the problem was solved, he felt completely relaxed and could focus on his cultivation, aiming to break through to the next level.

Unfortunately, Han Li didn't have any suitable elixirs to consume, so he could only absorb the energy of the heavens and earth to cultivate. However, he had already opened most of his 1,800 spirit apertures, so breaking through to the next level would be relatively easier.

A golden light emanated from his body, enveloping his figure and condensing into a massive golden orb that pulsed like a giant heart.

As the orb pulsed, a concentrated energy of the heavens and earth flowed into it from all directions.

Time passed, and 180,000 years went by in the blink of an eye.

The time-space difference suddenly fluctuated, and the golden orb trembled before rapidly shrinking and disappearing, revealing Han Li's figure.

His body was still surrounded by a golden aura, with countless golden points of light, indicating that he had opened 460 spirit apertures.

Although he hadn't consumed any elixirs, Han Li had opened 100 spirit apertures in 180,000 years.

However, he didn't focus on this achievement, instead gazing at the air, his eyes fixed on the True Word Treasure Wheel. He raised his hand, and the wheel descended, stopping in front of him. The last temporal pattern on the wheel was slowly fading away.

"Indeed..." Han Li murmured to himself.

When the temporal pattern disappeared, the time-space difference would collapse.

He had opened 1,800 spirit apertures, and the time-space difference had lasted for 180,000 years. According to his calculations, each spirit aperture could maintain the time-space difference for about 100 years.

Han Li's eyes sparkled with thoughts, and he realized that he needed to increase the number of spirit apertures in his body.

At the same time, Qī Hún and Xiao Bai also regained their awareness.

Xiao Bai had fully refined his father's bloodline energy, and his aura was now entirely that of a human. His energy had increased significantly, almost reaching the mid-stage of the Great Luo realm.

Han Li sensed Xiao Bai's aura and couldn't help but feel a flash of surprise before quickly regaining his composure.

Xiao Bai, as the only heir of the Mò Yǎn Pí Xiū, had a close relationship with the White Emperor, who would naturally provide him with various cultivation resources.

Although 180,000 years of cultivation was a short period for a Great Luo realm cultivator, Xiao Bai's progress was still impressive.

Qī Hún's aura had also increased, but not as much as Xiao Bai's. However, her Dispersed Soul Ghost Flute had been fully refined, and the ghostly notes surrounding it were a testament to its power.

Han Li only glanced at the flute, and his mind was filled with the sound of ghostly wails. His divine sense was shaken, and he quickly calmed himself, looking away.

The Jing Yan Tong Zi had also stopped cultivating, and his energy had fully recovered. He had even become stronger, with flames dancing around his body, radiating intense light and heat.
