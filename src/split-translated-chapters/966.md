E Shi finished speaking, and his joints emitted a strange, crackling sound. His body suddenly expanded several feet, and a hand emerged from his sleeve, similar to Han Li's earlier action. The palm of his hand pressed against the blood-colored glow, creating a dent that struck the stone beast statue.

The moment his palm touched the statue, his five fingers suddenly arched and stabbed through the blood-colored light screen, pressing against the scaled beast statue.

As he began to chant rapidly, his fingers twisted, causing the statue to vibrate violently. The blood-red glow on its body dimmed significantly.

A faint "puff" sound was heard, and the blood cocoon surrounding Qin Yuan suddenly burst open.

E Shi pinched his hand into a seal, while his other hand manipulated the air within the blood formation, summoning a blood-colored aura that condensed into a massive, blood-colored hand. The hand abruptly extended towards Qin Yuan and seized him.

Han Li, witnessing this, was about to intervene, but he felt a sudden jolt in his heart and rapidly gazed upwards.

E Shi also reacted, looking up towards the sky.

The rooftop, once shrouded in a yellow cloud sea, had opened up to reveal a dazzling, silver light cascading down like a waterfall.

A deafening, electrical buzzing resounded from the high altitude, as if a sea of silver lightning had been poured down upon the great hall.

A thunderous roar shook the air, and the liquid lightning suddenly solidified, transforming into a massive, silver lightning pillar that plunged directly downwards, striking E Shi with unerring accuracy.

The lightning pillar crackled with electricity, releasing thick electrical threads accompanied by a deafening, dragon-like roar, displaying unimaginable power.

Han Li swiftly manipulated his formation and retreated several dozen feet.

E Shi's eyes flashed with surprise, but without hesitation, he flung Qin Yuan upwards, directly into the path of the lightning pillar.

A thunderous explosion boomed through the air, and Qin Yuan's body disintegrated into nothing but gray ash, his Nascent Soul unable to escape.

The silver electrical discharge ignited, expanding into a blinding, white light that illuminated the entire hall, forcing everyone to cover their eyes.

No one noticed Chen Yang, still motionless on the ground, slowly extracting a black, circular mirror the size of a palm and manipulating it with his blood-stained hands. His lips trembled, releasing faint whispers.

Simultaneously, a ring of white light materialized around E Shi's body.

The dissipated electrical energy recondensed, forming another lightning pillar that hurtled towards E Shi, its power seemingly undiminished.

E Shi's expression turned somber, and he retreated several dozen feet, abandoning his pursuit of Han Li.

Just as the lightning pillar was about to miss its target, it changed direction, pursuing E Shi with unrelenting ferocity.

E Shi dodged the attack, but the lightning pillar persistently pursued him, twisting and turning to keep up.

A furious E Shi suddenly spotted Chen Yang's black mirror and inferred its connection to the mysterious lightning. He swiftly retrieved a white, circular mirror from his sleeve, differing only in color and shape from Chen Yang's black mirror.

With a battle cry, E Shi flung his white mirror towards the prostrate Chen Yang.

The mirror crashed to the ground, rolled a few times, and came to rest beside Chen Yang. The surface flashed with white light, and an arc of light rebounded, striking E Shi, no matter how he tried to evade.

Chen Yang smiled coldly, his eyes glinting with amusement, as he weakly lifted his head to observe the scene.

"You have worn the Yin-Yang Mirror for many years, and it has absorbed your aura. There's no escape..."

E Shi's rage intensified, but he could not focus on retaliating, for the relentless lightning pillar pursued him with growing ferocity.

Zhu Zi Yuan and others were baffled by the mysterious lightning, unsure of its origin, yet witnessing its awe-inspiring power.

Others whispered among themselves, urging the lightning on: "Faster, faster..."

After several evasive maneuvers, E Shi realized that the lightning showed no signs of weakening. Resolute determination flashed in his eyes.

Landing in front of the three stone arches, E Shi halted, his body glowing with an intense, protective energy. Over a thousand acupuncture points on his body lit up, unleashing a shield of blazing white energy.

With a thunderous battle cry, E Shi faced the incoming lightning pillar, raising his fist to confront it.

A deafening boom shook the air...
A brilliant silver flash suddenly erupted, transforming into a spherical bolt of lightning that enveloped Yueshan's entire body.

The surrounding air was fiercely turbulent with silver electrical currents, causing the space to severely fluctuate and spawn visible cracks that constantly opened and closed.

The blood-colored screen trembled violently, nearly ripped apart, but fortunately, the large array absorbed the blood and flesh energy as nourishment, preventing it from collapsing.

Han Li's heart shook with shock. He looked up at the sky once more, where a sea of yellow clouds reappeared with a black hole still swirling within, making it impossible to determine if more lightning would strike.

His eyes focused, and he immediately accelerated the array's operation, doubling the absorption of the Naihexin Array's blood and flesh energy. Mentally prepared, he was also ready to retreat at any moment.

After several dozen breaths, the massive spherical lightning finally dissipated.

All silver electrical threads gradually disappeared, and Yueshan's silhouette, shrouded within, reappeared.

Still standing upright, his entire body's vital points glimmered unpredictably like starry night skies. However, his right arm, where the lightning had made direct contact, had turned into black charcoal, with black ash continuously falling off.

"Ahhh..."

Yueshan exhaled a long breath, and white smoke burst from his mouth.

His right shoulder violently shook, and the entire arm crumbled into black ashes.

However, a burst of white light soon erupted from the severed arm's stump, covering the wound, and in the blink of an eye, flesh and bone regenerated, fully restoring his arm.

...

Yueshan's cheek was crimson, and the radiant vital points on his body flickered and vanished, revealing his physique.

His body was also a deep red, with bulging veins, resembling numerous green snakes coiled around his body, an extremely frightening sight.

"Linggong Technique!" Han Li's face moved within the Blood Array.

In the next moment, Yueshan's crimson color instantly faded, and his face turned deathly pale. His footsteps also became unsteady.

Not only that, but all his vital points simultaneously sprayed blood, then quickly dulled down. He couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of blood.

Although Yueshan had timely employed the Linggong Technique to counter the lightning, the shocking lightning bolt had actually shaken all his vital points.

"City Lord!" Zhu Ziyuan and Zhu Ziqing rushed over, supporting Yueshan, their faces filled with worry.

Yueshan ignored them, gazing upwards.

"E Daoyou, it's been a while. How have you been?"

At this moment, accompanied by a sweet, chuckling voice, seven silhouettes leaped out from the rooftop, the first being Shaxin in a white dress, her slender figure exuding elegance.

The mysterious woman in the black dress and veil also appeared, standing closely behind Shaxin.

The remaining five people were Zhuoge, Wu Yun, the sturdy giant, and two bald, black-armored men.

Yueshan's eyes narrowed, seemingly unsurprised by Shaxin's group's arrival. He pushed Zhu Ziyuan and Zhu Ziqing aside, stabilizing his body.

Sun Tu and others, witnessing the appearance of Shaxin's group, were shocked.

Within the Blood Array, Han Li saw Shaxin's group, and his eyes flashed with alarm. His gaze rested on the mysterious black-dressed woman for a moment, only to quickly move away. Han Li's face continued to show pain as he frantically accelerated the green vial's absorption of the blood and flesh energy from below.

Shaxin's group landed on the ground, their faces changing upon seeing Yueshan and the massive Blood Array within the hall.

The mysterious black-dressed woman gazed at the wretched Han Li within the Blood Array, her delicate body trembling. A peculiar glow emerged in her eyes, and her lips, hidden behind the black veil, slightly parted, as if about to speak.

In that instant, several golden patterns appeared on her forehead, her eyes turning dazed. However, she immediately regained her composure. The unusual color in her eyes had vanished, replaced by tranquility.

The mysterious woman's transformation was momentary, and the surrounding crowd failed to notice. Han Li, however, had been watching her and witnessed the change. He was taken aback.

Just then, two silhouettes flashed by, joining Shaxin's group. They were Chenyang and Xuantun Xing.

Chenyang's face now displayed a radiant blood glow, indicating he had consumed a certain medicinal pill, regaining his mobility. However, his movements still seemed unstable.

"Chen Daoyou, after years of planning, we've finally succeeded! You should take the credit!" Zhuoge laughed, his face exposing excitement.

"It was just luck. I must thank Shaxin City Lord for her clever arrangements. When I first became the City Lord of Qingyang, she presented the dark lightning mirror as a gift, which I naturally treasured. As it contains dark lightning energy that benefits my cultivation, I've kept it close to my body. Everything has unfolded as planned!" Chenyang smiled.

"Xuantun, who's been hiding in Xuan City for years, also deserves congratulations. You'll be rewarded later." Zhuoge continued, addressing Xuantun Xing.

"I'm honored to serve the City Lord. I dare not ask for rewards." Xuantun Xing respectfully replied.

"Excellent! You've been collaborating for so long, setting up a plan from back then. How ingenious!" Yueshan's expression turned ugly as he listened to Chenyang's conversation, his voice cold.

Yueshan's eyes narrowed, seemingly unsurprised by Shaxin's group's appearance. He pushed Zhu Ziyuan and Zhu Ziqing aside, stabilizing his body.

As Yueshan's group fell to the ground, taking in the hall's situation, especially the colossal Blood Array and Han Li within, their faces changed in unison.

Yueshan's eyes were fixed on Shaxin's group. "Now that the truth's out, Shaxin Daoyou has been plotting with you since my ascension to City Lord. Your plan has indeed been ingenious."
