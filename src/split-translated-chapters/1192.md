Han Li didn't linger any longer, turning back to gaze at the still thundering Thunder Domain before flying off in a different direction.

Just as he did, his brow twitched, and he stopped his escape light, his hands forming a seal to activate his magic.

As his face glowed with a faint red light, the Wheel of Reincarnation mask flickered into existence, and a light screen appeared before him.

He fixed his gaze on the screen, his eyes shining with great joy, for he had received a response to his task of searching for materials containing the Time Law.

Han Li hastily opened the task, but his entire body suddenly froze.

Before him, a slender figure emerged from the void, her face covered with a crimson mask, looking familiar yet unexpected - it was Jiao San.

"Jiao San, how is it you? You have the materials containing the Time Law?" Han Li asked, his eyes flashing with curiosity.

"Brother Han, it's been a long time. I wouldn't deceive you, having taken on your task," Jiao San replied, her voice light and carefree, as if she hadn't noticed Han Li's doubt.

"Thank you, Jiao San. The materials are exactly what I need. How many spirit stones do you want?" Han Li asked, taking a deep breath.

Jiao San held out a half-meter-long, cyan-colored ancient wood, identical to the one that Mi Luo Old Ancestor had intended to give him but hadn't.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he realized that Jiao San's materials were the same as the one he needed.

"Brother Han, your help in the Tai Sui Immortal Mansion is still unpaid. This small material is hardly worth mentioning. If you need it, just take it," Jiao San said, her voice calm and composed, as she activated her magic.

The transmission array on Han Li's task interface flashed green, and the ancient wood materialized before him.

Han Li stared at the wood, his mind racing with thoughts. He didn't immediately take it.

"The Tai Sui Immortal Mansion matter has been settled. I couldn't possibly take this treasure for free. Please, Jiao San, name your price or propose a trade," Han Li said, shaking his head.

"If that's the case, I'll propose a condition. After the Jiu Yuan Observation task begins, you'll do something for me, and that will be considered payment for this material," Jiao San said, smiling.

"What is it that you need me to do? Please, tell me," Han Li asked, his curiosity piqued.

"You don't need to worry, it's not a difficult task, and it won't put you in danger. I just can't explain it in detail right now," Jiao San said, shaking her head.

"Alright, I agree. By the way, when will the Wheel of Reincarnation's task for the Jiu Yuan Observation begin?" Han Li asked, after a moment's thought.

"It's been delayed, and I'm not sure when it will start. But I think it won't be too long, maybe a hundred years at most," Jiao San replied.

Han Li's heart relaxed slightly upon hearing this.

Within a hundred years, Xiao Bai should still be able to make it.

"Brother Han, I don't know where you are now, but the Great Jin Yuan Immortal Domain is in turmoil. It's best if you don't go there for now. Find a place to cultivate in seclusion, and I'll notify you when the time is right," Jiao San said, her eyes serious with concern.

Han Li merely nodded, neither confirming nor denying her words.

The two chatted for a bit longer before ending their transmission.

Han Li took out the ancient wood and examined it, his eyes shining with excitement.

With this wood, he would be able to balance the five Time Law forces within him, and advancing to the Great Luo Realm would be almost guaranteed. However, this breakthrough would require a safe and stable location.

Han Li put the wood away, pondered for a moment, and then flew towards the deeper regions of the Savage Wilderness Domain.

The Savage Wilderness Domain was filled with fierce beasts, but it was safer than the Great Jin Yuan Immortal Domain. Jiao San had also warned him not to enter the Great Jin Yuan Immortal Domain for now.

Han Li had recently come from the Ba Huang Mountains, so he was familiar with the Savage Wilderness Domain. He quickly found a safe location in the deeper regions.

The area was a range of mountains with abundant water sources and underground fire, making it shrouded in dense fog, making it difficult to detect from high altitudes.

Han Li carefully explored the surrounding mountains, finding no unusual signs, and then opened a temporary cave dwelling at the foot of a mountain peak. He set up layers of restrictions around the area.

He completed all this in less than half a day, having done it many times before.

Han Li opened the Flower Branch Space and entered it.

He had a limited amount of spirit stones and Time Law forces within the Years God Lamp, and the space inside was currently empty.

"Master, how's the bamboo sword's refinement going?" Xiao Bai asked, welcoming Han Li.

"It's going smoothly," Han Li replied.
Han Li's eyes sparkled with excitement as he said, "Not yet, my current cultivation is not enough, even with your help, I'm not confident in our chances of success. However, I recently obtained a treasure that will greatly aid my cultivation, so I plan to close up for a period of time to attempt to break through to the Mahayana stage."

Xiao Bai's eyes widened with excitement, but then he frowned, "Breaking through to the Mahayana stage! Master, you cultivate the Time Law, if you can break through, your power will surely increase greatly, and we can definitely rescue Old Master! However, the time required to break through to the Mahayana stage is not short, will it delay the rescue of Old Master? The King only gave me 200 years..."

Han Li nodded thoughtfully, "Even if I reach the Mahayana stage, I still won't be certain of success, I need to combine it with the right timing and circumstances. Don't worry, I have a plan."

Xiao Bai wanted to say more, but Han Li's eyes suddenly shifted to a white fireball in the distance, and he swiftly made a hand seal.

A golden light shot out and disappeared into the fireball, which then dissipated, revealing the figure of Jing Yanzi, who flew over to Han Li, babbling excitedly.

After years of bitter cultivation, Jing Yanzi's body had grown stronger, and his Fire Law had become more powerful.

"Xiao Bai, Jing Yanzi, I'm going to attempt to break through to the Mahayana stage, although I've set up defensive restrictions outside, if a strong enemy comes, it's still not safe. Please go and keep watch outside."

Xiao Bai patted his chest, "Don't worry, Master, I'll take care of it!"

Jing Yanzi also exclaimed, making a guarantee, and then they both flew out.

Han Li smiled, then activated the Guangyin Tian Xuan Array, and the time flow in the flower branch space changed.

This time, Han Li didn't know how long it would take to break through to the Mahayana stage, so he started the time difference space to be safe.

After doing all this, Han Li flew to the attic, took out a piece of blue ancient wood, and operated the Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique, condensing a golden ring around the wood.

With a loud "crack", the blue ancient wood was crushed, and countless golden light points flew out, merging into the golden ring, and then transforming into 50-60 time law crystals, which wrapped around the Dong Yi divine wood.

Although the time law crystals on the Duan Shi fire stick were still a few more, the time law crystals on the five physical objects were now basically balanced.

The five physical objects suddenly lit up, surrounding Han Li and flying rapidly.

Han Li's heart was shaken, and a sense of enlightenment emerged, the bottleneck of the Mahayana stage that had been stuck in front of him began to loosen.

"Indeed, as Master said, balance is the most important thing!" Han Li thought to himself, feeling grateful to Mi Luo Lao Zu.

Then Han Li took out the various preparations for breaking through to the Mahayana stage, especially the Xuan Zhen Dan, and placed them beside him.

Last time, he had stopped before reaching the end, so he hadn't used the dan.

Han Li closed his eyes, sat quietly for half a day, waiting for his heart to calm down, before slowly operating the Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique.

A dazzling golden light burst forth from his body, engulfing him.

A massive time law energy began to churn in the attic, causing the attic to shake and the surrounding heaven and earth to tremble, slowly gathering towards Han Li.

...

In the North Cold Immortal Domain, in the ancient continent's outer sea, there was a sea area known as the East Flowing Sea.

In this sea area, which was always frozen, there was a deep blue sea area that was not frozen, and within it, there was a black trench that descended to the bottom of the sea.

At the bottom of the trench, there was a gray-white stone monument, which was the entrance to a secret realm, known as the "Floating Mountain" secret realm.

This secret realm was rich in spiritual herbs, and was originally an important resource area for the Zhu Long Dao sect, where Han Li had once been stationed. However, after the decline of the Zhu Long Dao sect, this secret realm was taken over by the North Cold Immortal Palace.

In the secret realm, on a white stone platform on a green mountain peak, a middle-aged man with a gray-white robe and a disheveled beard, was holding a white jade wine pot, leaning against the railing, looking intoxicated.

His eyes were bloodshot, and his expression was desolate, as he gazed out at the surrounding void, where thousands of peaks floated, each covered in lush vegetation, and hanging with green vines.

He was originally one of the 36 deputy masters of the Zhu Long Dao sect, and was quite powerful. However, during the sect's upheaval, he had been slow to react, and was eventually demoted to manage this secret realm.

Compared to his former glory, he now looked extremely downcast.
