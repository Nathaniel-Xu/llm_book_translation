So that's how it is. This white wind pillar is a divine ability that combines two types of law forces, no wonder it's so powerful. Han Li thought to himself.

Law fusion increases power greatly.

However, law fusion is extremely difficult to achieve. He had seen a few people use similar divine abilities during his time in the True Immortal Realm, such as Gong Shu Tian and his companions, Lan Yan and Lan Yuanzi, and even his own time law and Jiao San's reincarnation law had resonated with each other.

But the law fusion of those people was very shallow compared to the white wind pillar's law fusion.

Han Li's eyes flickered as he pondered the problem of law fusion, but he couldn't think of anything for the time being. He sighed inwardly.

Law fusion is a profound and obscure secret art, and it's naturally very rare to find records of it in ancient texts. Even if there are records, they should be in the hands of a few people, and it's unlikely that they would be widely circulated.

He had been cultivating alone for many years, and although he was free to do as he pleased, he lacked guidance and experience.

It seemed that after leaving this place, he would have to find someone to ask for guidance on law cultivation and spiritual domain cultivation. As the reincarnation son of the reincarnation hall, he should be able to find someone to guide him as long as he was willing to spend immortal stones.

"You're only this capable? You're really too weak, and it's disappointing!" Just as Han Li was thinking, the white figure inside the wind pillar spoke again, with a look of great disappointment.

Lei Yu Ce and the others heard this and their faces turned red with anger. They let out a low roar, and their auras surged as they each used their spiritual domain divine abilities.

In an instant, various spiritual domains appeared, overlapping with each other.

Especially Lei Yu Ce's golden spiritual domain, which was the most magnificent. Inside the spiritual domain, a series of golden mountains appeared, with snow-white golden sword blades inserted into the mountains, emitting a fierce and piercing sword intent.

As soon as they opened their spiritual domains, the several people's bodies stabilized, and they were no longer affected by the wind pillar's rotation.

Lei Yu Ce's face was solemn as he muttered to himself, his hands moving quickly as he formed a sword seal.

The sword seal was 10% complete, and a flash of golden light appeared on his body. In a burst of sharp whistling sounds, five or six dozen golden crystal threads shot out from his body, each emitting strong law fluctuations. These were the law crystal threads.

The golden sword blades inside Lei Yu Ce's spiritual domain seemed to be summoned, and they flew out, merging with the golden law crystal threads.

The golden crystal threads immediately changed, and in a burst of intertwining and wrapping, they transformed into five or six dozen golden giant swords, each with a different shape. Some had broad and flat blades, while others were long and slender, like needle swords. Some even had the shape of dragons or tigers.

The only thing they had in common was that each sword emitted a vast and powerful aura, with a might that could shatter the heavens.

The five or six dozen golden giant swords swam and flew around inside the spiritual domain, and although each sword emitted a powerful sword intent, they didn't conflict with each other at all. Instead, they formed a strange and wonderful sword array.

The sword array was 10% complete, and the sword energy emitted by the five or six dozen giant swords suddenly gathered together, forming a fierce and powerful sword energy that filled the entire void.

"Cut!" Lei Yu Ce's eyes flashed with a fierce light, and he pulled out his sword seal.

The sword array rotated, and each of the five or six dozen giant swords shot out a massive sword energy, cutting at the white wind pillar.

A tearing sound echoed through the air, and the white wind pillar was suddenly enlarged, with a series of cracks appearing on its surface. The cracks emitted a dazzling golden light.

Han Li, who was watching from a distance, saw the sword array's divine power and his eyes flashed with a hot light.

He had learned many sword arrays, including the Qing Pan Sword Array and the Qiu Long Sword Array, but compared to Lei Yu Ce's sword array, they were all inferior.

The Tong Tian Sword Sect was known as the number one sect in the Golden Source Immortal Realm, and it seemed that they had indeed achieved great things in the way of sword arrays.

Han Li was also surprised that Lei Yu Ce didn't use flying swords, but instead used law crystal threads to create flying swords and form a sword array, and the sword array's power was so great.

Wen Zhong saw Lei Yu Ce's sword array and a hint of envy flashed in his eyes, but he didn't idle around. He formed a seal and swung his hand.

A low humming sound echoed through the air, and four massive golden sword lights shot out from his spiritual domain.

Each sword light was over a hundred feet long, and they were inscribed with the patterns of the four mythical creatures: the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird, and the Black Tortoise. They emitted a fierce and powerful sword energy, although it was weaker than Lei Yu Ce's sword array.

Wen Zhong pointed forward with one hand, and the four sword lights shot out, almost simultaneously cutting down at the white wind pillar.

Lan Yan opened up a blue spiritual domain and simultaneously took out the water-blue curved scythe, using the Water Yuan Slash divine ability. A massive blue arc cut towards the white wind pillar.

Xiong Shan also used his spiritual domain divine ability, and at this critical moment, he didn't hold back. He waved his hand and took out a hundred flying swords, forming a golden sword array that was several dozen feet in diameter.

A mighty roar echoed through the air, and the golden sword array emitted a brilliant light. A golden sword dragon formed from the sword lights flew out, its jaws wide open as it pounced at the wind pillar.

The two black-robed men didn't open up their spiritual domains, and instead took out a magical artifact each.
A black-robed woman took out a large white bead, on which were drawn golden patterns, and the power of the laws surged, shining brightly.

The black-robed youth, on the other hand, waved his hand and took out a treelike artifact, about a few feet long, with seven branches, each with a dark, fierce glow at the tip, emitting a bloody aura, clearly an evil and sinister tool.

As soon as the two artifacts were released, they immediately burst into light, transforming into a black and white pair of shooting stars, fiercely striking the wind column.

These people's divine abilities were not small, and when they joined forces, the cracks on the white wind column suddenly expanded again, with a hint of collapse.

"Tsk, tsk, the Heavenly Sword Array is indeed extraordinary! However, you have limited understanding of the laws, and the threads of the laws are insufficient, so you cannot fully master this sword array. You want to break my 'Heavenly Wind Column'? Look at this!" a sharp voice laughed.

Before the laughter had faded, the white wind column flashed with light, and a white spiritual domain appeared, rapidly expanding in all directions.

This spiritual domain was filled with countless white clouds, changing unpredictably, giving a sense of being unable to grasp, yet also covering the entire sky, as if encompassing all the winds and clouds of the heavens.

The white spiritual domain was extremely vast, far surpassing the spiritual domains of Lei Yuze and the others, instantly enveloping their domains.

The group suddenly felt a sinking sensation, as if their bodies had fallen into a bottomless pit, and it was extremely difficult to move. Their spiritual domains were also severely disrupted by a massive force of the laws.

At the same time, nearly a hundred white crystal threads shot out from the white spiritual domain, merging into the white wind column.

The white wind column suddenly brightened, and the broken area was instantly repaired, becoming even thicker, once again firmly trapping the group.

From a distance, the three people saw this scene, and their faces changed, especially Su Zhongyan's eyes, which were fixed on the white wind column, her lips pursed, and a hint of worry flashed in her eyes, as if she was worried about someone.

"Unexpectedly, the opponent is so powerful. It seems that Lei Yuze and the others are no match for them. Should we intervene?" Jing Liu looked at Su Zhongyan and Han Li.

"We may not have a deep relationship with Lei Yuze and the others, but we are fellow travelers. Let's rescue them. If we just stand by and watch, they will fall, and our own situation will be precarious." Su Zhongyan said, looking at Han Li.

On this journey, Han Li's strength and judgment had already amazed her, and she had begun to regard him as the core of their group, especially at critical moments.

Jing Liu, although unwilling, also looked at Han Li.

"Sister Su is right, we are all in this together, sharing the same fate." Han Li nodded.

The three people had made up their minds, and their figures simultaneously became blurry, disappearing into thin air.

At this moment, inside the white wind column, Lei Yuze's face was unsightly, his eyes flashing with a hint of desperation, and his face turned blood-red.

He shouted loudly, his hands flying quickly to form a seal, and a golden light flashed on his forehead, as a golden infant the size of a palm appeared.

The infant's small hands moved, and a golden, blood-like substance was spat out, containing a powerful force of the laws, merging with the surrounding golden spiritual domain.

Lei Yuze's face, which had turned blood-red, suddenly became pale, and his skin was covered in wrinkles, as if he had aged greatly.

However, the golden spiritual domain around him suddenly brightened, and the Heavenly Sword Array flashed with light, as all the giant swords flew back, surrounding his body and rapidly spinning.

A loud explosion sounded, and a massive sword intent burst forth from Lei Yuze's body, a golden, illusory giant sword appearing, with two intricate bird-like characters on it, its sword energy rising fiercely, as if about to break through the heavens.

The void around the giant sword was shattered, and the sound of "chi la" echoed through the air, as if the void was being torn apart.

"Slash!"

Lei Yuze's hands moved, and the giant sword shot out, slashing towards the white wind column.

Wherever the sword passed, the void was torn apart, as if it was made of paper.

"Ah, you've actually grasped the Heavenly Sword Array to this extent. However, your cultivation is too weak, and I'll break it!" a sharp voice from within the wind column responded, with a hint of solemnity.

As the voice faded, a loud, piercing sound echoed through the air, and a white hoof, the size of a house, appeared out of thin air.

A sharp whistling sound followed, and over a hundred white crystal threads emerged from the spiritual domain, merging into the white hoof.

The originally blurry white hoof suddenly became clear, and a massive white horse's hoof stomped down fiercely.
