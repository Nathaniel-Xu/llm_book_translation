A cultivator of the human tribe!

The white-robed woman was initially shocked, but then her eyes locked onto Han Li's identity, and a deep-seated hatred flashed in her eyes. The white cold light around her surged, and she was about to strike Han Li down.

"If you want these two to live, then stand still and don't move!" Han Li said calmly, then raised his hand in a seemingly casual motion.

A stream of green light shot out from his hand, blocking the surging blue cold light.

The blue flame seemed to be provoked, and it violently jumped and danced, the blue cold light also immediately bared its teeth and claws, like a furious beast, and violently attacked the green light.

The green light seemed thin and weak, but it was incredibly resilient, and no matter how the blue cold light attacked, it remained unmoving.

The white-robed woman saw this scene, and her raised arm stopped, but the white cold light around her did not dissipate, and it continued to stare at Han Li.

Han Li ignored the white-robed woman, and once again waved his sleeve.

Another stream of green light shot out, merging with the previous one, and then quickly suppressed the blue cold light.

The blue cold light that Ye Susu and the others had struggled to repel with great effort was unable to withstand Han Li's attack, and it was quickly pushed back to the small leg area.

Han Li waved his hand again, and a silver flame shot out from his sleeve, spinning and transforming into a silver firebird, which dove into the blue cold light and disappeared.

A clear and melodious cry echoed from within the blue cold light, and then a flash of silver light appeared, and a wave of intense heat burst out, causing the air around it to distort and become blurry.

The blue cold light was instantly torn apart and dispersed, and in its place, a wave of intense heat swept out, driving away the cold air in the room.

The ice crystals in the stone room instantly melted and disappeared.

The white-robed woman saw this scene, and her eyes widened in surprise, but her guard did not relax in the slightest.

After a short while, the silver firebird reappeared, its beak holding a small blue flame, and it swallowed it with a "gulp".

The blue flame disappeared into its mouth, and the firebird let out a happy cry, as if it had eaten a delicious meal.

Then the silver firebird flew back and disappeared into Han Li's sleeve.

At this time, the blue ice crystals on the blue-robed woman's body had completely disappeared, and she had unknowingly woken up, her eyes filled with a disbelieving expression.

The blue ice around Ye Susu had also disappeared, and she looked stunned.

But she immediately revealed a pained expression, and the green light around her body rapidly dissipated, her body shrinking, and a layer of green fur appearing on her skin.

"Susu!" the blue-robed woman's face changed, and she tried to get up from the bed.

"Don't move!" Han Li said calmly, and pointed his hand.

Two streams of green light shot out from his hand, entering the blue-robed woman's and Ye Susu's bodies.

The two women were immediately immobilized, as if they had been bound by a spell.

"You human tribe thief, what are you doing!" the white-robed woman shouted, her body flying towards Han Li.

Han Li didn't turn around, and waved his sleeve.

Five crystal threads shot out from his hand, entering the white-robed woman's body.

The white-robed woman's flying body froze, and she was unable to move, standing still and unable to struggle.

Han Li's other hand made a hand seal, and a blood light shot out, entering the blood array on the ground.

The blood array on the ground glowed brightly, and a wave of blood-colored light threads burst out, wrapping around the blue-robed woman's and Ye Susu's bodies, forming a blood-colored bridge between them.

Han Li's figure flashed, and he appeared beside the blue-robed woman, his palm striking her forehead.

A massive blood light shot out from his palm, raging into the blue-robed woman's body, and then flowed out, carrying away nearly half of the blue blood vessels on her body.

The blood light then flowed into Ye Susu's body, and the green fox blood vessels on her body reappeared, and her body returned to its original state, the green fur disappearing.

Moreover, the blood light also filled her body, replenishing the energy she had lost from using the array, and her pale face returned to normal, with a hint of redness.

Han Li stopped using the blood array, and his hands returned to his sides.
Ye Su Su and the other two regained their mobility.

"Who are you?" the woman in blue clothing asked, standing up from the bed, with a slight sway, and Ye Su Su quickly supported her.

"Mother, this is Han Qian Bei, the one I told you about before. Han Qian Bei, this is my mother, the leader of the Qing Huo tribe." Ye Su Su quickly introduced them.

"Ah, Han Dao You, nice to meet you. I am Ye Luo, the leader of the Qing Huo tribe. Thank you for helping me and my daughter, driving out the cold toxin from my body and restoring my Qing Huo bloodline. I owe you a great debt, and if you need anything from our tribe in the future, just let us know." Ye Luo said solemnly.

The white-clothed woman beside her furrowed her brow, but didn't say anything.

"No need to be polite, I'm just a guest in Qing Huo City, and I saw that the master had a problem, so I naturally lent a hand." Han Li said with a faint smile.

"Han Qian Bei's divine abilities are truly remarkable, easily driving out the cold toxin from my mother's body and restoring my bloodline. How did you do it?" Ye Su Su asked, looking at Han Li with a few hints of admiration.

"Han Mou has done some research on bloodlines, and it was fortunate that Ye Dao You's bloodline and the leader's body hadn't completely dissipated, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to restore it." Han Li explained vaguely.

"Han Dao You, thank you for saving our leader and young master. But I have a question, this is a secret place of our Qing Huo tribe, how did you enter without permission?" The white-clothed woman asked, her tone somewhat aggressive.

"Han Dao You, this is Ye Qiu, our tribe's elder. Qiu Long Lao, Han Dao You is our tribe's noble guest, don't speak out of turn." Ye Luo quickly introduced the white-clothed woman's identity, then softly scolded her.

"No need to apologize, Qiu Long Lao's question is normal. Han Mou is quite skilled in investigative arts, and tonight I was bored, so I went out to admire the moon, and felt the intense fluctuations in the atmosphere here, so I cast a spell to investigate, and saw the situation was critical, so I came to intervene, and apologize for any offense." Han Li said with a light laugh.

"Ah, I see. Thanks to Han Qian Bei's timely arrival." Ye Su Su said, sticking out her tongue.

"You should say, earlier, you were reckless, and dared to transfer the bloodline on your own, such a major matter, if Han Dao You hadn't been here, the consequences would have been unthinkable." Ye Luo said sternly.

Ye Su Su looked down, her small mouth pouting, seemingly not very obedient.

Ye Luo saw Ye Su Su's expression, and glared at her, but didn't scold her further, considering Han Li's presence.

"This place is a mess, it's not suitable for receiving Han Dao You, Su Su, you take Han Dao You back, and I'll go visit him personally tomorrow." Ye Luo said.

"I'll take my leave then." Han Li said, nodding slightly.

Ye Luo returned the courtesy, but Ye Qiu didn't move, her face cold and unfriendly, clearly full of distrust towards Han Li.

Han Li didn't pay attention to Ye Qiu's attitude, and turned to leave.

Ye Su Su followed closely behind, and they soon exited the underground tunnel, and arrived outside.

Han Li looked at the numerous spiritual fields in the valley, and stopped.

"I noticed this place earlier, and didn't expect to see so many spiritual fields, and the spiritual grass and medicine inside are of such high quality. Is your Qing Huo tribe skilled in cultivating spiritual grass?" Han Li asked Ye Su Su.

"The spiritual fields are surrounded by restrictions, and Han Qian Bei can see the situation inside? Ah, yes, the restrictions here are no match for Han Qian Bei's skills." Ye Su Su seemed to have relaxed a lot, and playfully raised an eyebrow, then smiled.

Han Li just smiled, and didn't respond.

"As for cultivating spiritual grass and medicine, I'm not bragging, but in the entire Jin Yuan mountain range, our Qing Huo tribe is second to none! Han Qian Bei, do you need any spiritual grass for cultivation? This is a list of the various spiritual grass and medicine that our tribe cultivates, if you need any, just let me know, and I'll send them over immediately." Ye Su Su said proudly, then took out a jade slip and handed it to Han Li.

"I do need some spiritual grass, so I won't be polite." Han Li took the jade slip, and scanned it with his divine sense, nodding inwardly, then said.

He had already looked at the spiritual grass and medicine in the fields, and they matched the records on the jade slip, and Ye Su Su hadn't hidden anything.

"Han Qian Bei, Qiu Long Lao wasn't very friendly to you earlier, please forgive her. She's not intentionally targeting you, but Qiu Long Lao's parents, and two younger brothers, all died at the hands of human cultivators, so she's very hostile towards human cultivators." Ye Su Su whispered.

"Ah, I understand." Han Li said, nodding.

The two of them didn't stay there, and soon flew off towards the distance.

...

In the underground stone room, Ye Qiu set up several layers of restrictions, then stopped.

"Qiu Long Lao, I know you hate human cultivators, but Han Dao You has helped our tribe three times, so please try to control your hostility, at least on the surface, don't be so rude." Ye Luo said, sighing.

"Do you think this person came to our Qing Huo tribe with good intentions?" Ye Qiu asked, coldly.

"What do you mean?" Ye Luo asked, frowning.
