In the vast expanse of the Middle Earth Immortal Realm, there existed a peculiar continent known as the Qitian Continent.

The native cultivators of this continent were not enthusiastic about practicing immortal arts, nor were they infatuated with alchemy or artifact refinement. Instead, they were all fond of practicing the art of Dragon Aura Divination.

Dragon Aura Divination, as the name suggests, was a technique that utilized aura-reading to explore the fate and destiny of others, thereby predicting their future prospects and potential accomplishments.

In the mortal realm, some individuals used this technique to search for those with dragon aura, who were destined for greatness. By assisting these individuals in their rise to power, they could establish a secular kingdom and reap enormous benefits.

The immortal families, on the other hand, used this technique to discover and recruit young talents who had not yet begun their cultivation journey. Those who were skilled in this art could often identify the future prospects of a child, even before they had started their cultivation, and help the immortal families to recruit and nurture talented individuals.

The Qitian Continent was particularly renowned for this art, and the reason for this was deeply connected to the continent's largest and most influential immortal family, the Bū Tiān Sect.

The Bū Tiān Sect, with its vast influence, occupied half of the Qitian Continent. The sect's history spanned countless years, and it had innumerable disciples. It was said that "before the Bū Tiān Sect, there was no divination; all phenomena originated from this sect."

Aside from its expertise in divination and aura-reading, the Bū Tiān Sect possessed a secret art that was coveted by various factions in the immortal realm. This art involved the use of primordial divine stones to create mysterious objects that could predict the workings of the heavens. The most famous of these objects was the "Hún Dùn Wàn Líng Bǎng" (Chaos Spirit Ranking), which was said to be able to foresee changes in the celestial balance.

This object was incredibly accurate, and it was said that even before the birth of the Xuán Tiān Spirit Treasure, the Chaos Spirit Ranking had already foretold its arrival. It was even able to pinpoint the location of the treasure's emergence.

However, despite its illustrious reputation, the Bū Tiān Sect's disciples rarely revealed their true identities when they descended the mountain to gain experience. Instead, they would often conceal their identities or assume the guise of disciples from other sects, blending in with the various immortal domains.

The Bū Tiān Sect's headquarters was located in the eastern part of the Qitian Continent, where it occupied the Wò Lóng, Zhōu Tiān, and Bǎi Jǐ mountains. The sect's main stronghold was the Wò Lóng mountain range, where the majority of its disciples resided.

The Bū Tiān Sect's founder had established the sect in the Wò Lóng mountain range, and the main peak, Lóng Qǐ Fēng (Dragon Rise Peak), was now the sect's absolute forbidden zone. Only the current sect leader and a handful of elder masters were permitted to enter this sacred area.

Adjacent to the Dragon Rise Peak was the Wèn Tiān Fēng (Inquiring Heaven Peak), where the sect's core disciples cultivated their arts. The peak was dotted with Heaven-Inquiring Altars, where disciples clad in black robes would inquire about the workings of the heavens.

At this moment, a group of disciples, led by a tall, stern-looking elder, stood on the edge of a Heaven-Inquiring Altar, seeking guidance.

"Fú Fēng Elder, we are about to descend the mountain and gain experience in the various immortal domains. Do you have any further instructions?" a disciple with the body of a sheep and the head of a man asked.

"When you descend the mountain, you will likely be assigned to the Flying Immortal Platforms of the various immortal domains. Remember one thing: do not underestimate any cultivator who has ascended from the mortal realm. These individuals often possess superior temperament and innate abilities compared to the native cultivators of the immortal realm."

The disciples nodded in unison, acknowledging the elder's words.

"As for those who have ascended from the Lost Realms, do not attempt to divine their fates. If you can form a connection with them, do so; if not, then sever all ties and avoid any further entanglements."

The elder's expression turned solemn, and the disciples, though perplexed, nodded in agreement.

After the disciples departed, the elder stood alone on the edge of the altar, lost in thought. His eyes seemed to hold a deep nostalgia, and he whispered to himself, "I wonder, what has become of that young man?"

Years ago, when he was still known as "Gāo Shēng" (High Ascent), he had encountered a young cultivator who had ascended from the Lost Realms. Out of curiosity, he had used the Dragon Aura Divination technique to explore the young man's fate and had even employed the secret art to uncover his future prospects.

Though he had only glimpsed fragments of the young man's destiny, the experience had left an indelible mark on him. Despite his advanced age, he still remembered the young man's face, and the encounter had changed him forever.

The young man's name was Hán Lì (Han Li).

The elder's thoughts were interrupted by a sudden change in the atmosphere. He looked up to see a spiral cloud formation descending from the heavens, piercing the clouds that shrouded the Dragon Rise Peak. The peak's restrictive array, which had been in place for centuries, remained eerily silent.

The elder's gaze turned towards the grand hall at the foot of the peak, where the elder masters resided. However, he saw no reaction from them, and his expression turned quizzical.

The Dragon Rise Peak was now shrouded in a thick, impenetrable mist. Amidst the mist, a forest of peach trees grew, their branches heavy with fruit. The trees seemed to be swaying gently in the breeze, and the atmosphere was filled with an otherworldly aura.

The mist seemed to be hiding a secret, and the elder's curiosity was piqued. He turned to leave, his eyes fixed on the mysterious peak.
In the center of a mountain peak surrounded by lush green trees, an eight-sided black stone altar was built, with a circumference of no more than three zhang. Each edge of the altar was engraved with a "Qian Kun Li Dui" trigram.

In the center of the altar, a black vortex floated in mid-air, with dense fog swirling inside, as if it had an endless attractive force.

At the center of the vortex, a face with a distorted expression was revealed, with an old man's body almost completely engulfed by the black vortex, leaving only a head, an arm, and a small part of his body connected to his neck.

The old man's forehead was bald, with white hair scattered behind him, one eye was blind, and his face was covered with black-brown spots, making him look very ugly.

His other eye, although not blind, was half-closed, and his entire body seemed to have lost its vitality, as if he was just waiting for death.

At this moment, a spiral cloud descended from the sky, silently landing on the peach tree outside the altar.

The cloud dissipated, revealing a figure.

The man was tall and slender, with a face like jade, and a pair of long, deep, and mysterious eyes. His nose was not too high, but his lips were thin, and his chin was adorned with black whiskers, giving him a tranquil and otherworldly aura.

However, he seemed to be suffering from an illness, sitting in a wheelchair carved from white jade, wearing a large white robe that flowed down from his body, with a golden sash around his waist, holding a nine-dragon jade pendant, and a golden tassel hanging beside it.

As soon as he appeared, the old man, who seemed to be pretending to sleep, suddenly woke up, his only eye opening wide, revealing a golden pupil that shone brightly, as if it was about to burn everything around him.

"You've come..." the old man said in a hoarse voice, his tone dragging on.

"I've come," the man in the wheelchair replied calmly.

"You've finally come... Ah, heaven's will is thus, you may ask your question." The old man smiled bitterly.

"Chen Pian, I have one more divination to ask," the man said, his hands resting on the wheelchair.

At this moment, if there were any high-ranking cultivators from the True Immortal Realm with some experience, they would be shocked.

Who could have imagined that this old man, who looked like he was about to die, was actually the founder of the Tian Tian Sect, Chen Pian, who was said to be able to "repair the heavenly mechanism"?

Who could have imagined that this ugly old man, who was about to be consumed by the heavenly way, was actually the prophetic ancestor who had mastered the art of predicting the future, and was famous throughout the heavenly court?

"I've already answered your 36 heavenly divinations, 72 earthly divinations, and in this vast expanse of time, you've asked 106 divinations, leaving only two more heavenly divinations... I can only answer once more." Chen Pian said slowly.

"I want to ask again about the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth... If he is not eliminated, I fear that the great plan will be disrupted." The man in the wheelchair said calmly.

"The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth has already mastered the law of rebirth, and can hide himself in the great way of rebirth, making it impossible for my prophetic law to detect him. You've already asked 72 divinations about him, and gained nothing, do you still want to ask about him?" Chen Pian's voice rose slightly.

"Ask." The man in the wheelchair replied, unmoved, his tone flat.

Chen Pian did not speak again, his remaining hand forming a seal, and his mouth began to chant, the golden light in his eye suddenly bursting forth, forming a crystal beam that shot into the void in front of him.

The void distorted, forming a black vortex that absorbed the crystal beam, Chen Pian and the black vortex seemed to be connected by a bridge.

About half a column of incense later, the crystal beam suddenly retracted, and the black vortex disappeared.

At the same time, the black vortex behind Chen Pian suddenly extended a thread of black crystal, wrapping around his remaining arm, pulling it into the vortex.

"How is it?" the man in the wheelchair asked, his expression unchanged.

"The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth is still nowhere to be found, but someone who has never appeared before, yet is closely related to him, has appeared." Chen Pian seemed to have expected his arm to be consumed by the vortex, and said calmly.

As he spoke, a crystal beam flew out from his brow, falling onto the man's hand, and then disappearing.

The man's eyes narrowed slightly, and a cloud of mist began to rise from beneath him, as if he was about to leave.

"The heavenly way's backlash is getting stronger, and with one more heavenly divination, I will be consumed by the heavenly way's law... How soon can your plan be completed?" Chen Pian asked, his voice weak.

"Soon."

The man in the wheelchair replied, his voice flat, and then, with the support of the mist, he flew up into the air, disappearing from sight.

"Whether in the past or present, I have made reckless predictions about the heavenly mechanism for you, don't let me suffer for eternity... " Chen Pian sighed, his one eye closing.

The mountain peak was once again shrouded in dense clouds.
