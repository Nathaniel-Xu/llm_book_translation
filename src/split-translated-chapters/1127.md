Han Li saw the fireflies swooping down, and he didn't dare to be careless. A golden light flashed behind him, and the True Word Treasure Wheel appeared, spinning rapidly.

The fireflies flew near, and suddenly they were like hitting an invisible wall, their speed slowing down, and they were trapped in mid-air.

Han Li saw this and slightly relaxed, thinking of taking out the Xuan Tian Gourd to store the fireflies. But then he saw a shocking scene.

The fireflies on their bodies suddenly burst into a golden flame, and the light flashed, consuming the golden light emitted by the Treasure Wheel.

As the golden light was consumed, the fireflies' speed suddenly increased, and they approached Han Li.

The fireflies in front of him were clearly not on the same level as the ones he had seen before.

Han Li's situation took a turn for the worse, while Jiao San and Huo San's situation was even more dire.

Jiao San was surrounded by the fireflies, and the blue light on her robes was being eaten away, leaving her on the verge of collapse.

Huo San's situation was even more miserable, his silver armor unable to withstand the fireflies. He could only move his body to avoid them, but accidentally bumped into a lamp.

The lamp suddenly burst into flames, and a red dragon emerged, wrapping itself around Huo San's body.

Huo San was shocked, and his hand trembled as he swung his Tian Huo Blood Knife, striking the dragon.

The dragon's body was torn apart, and it dissipated into a cloud of fire sparks.

Huo San saw this and let out a sigh of relief, but as he moved, two more lamps burst into flames, and two more dragons emerged, biting down on his shoulders.

His body was suddenly slowed down, and he was trapped in place.

The fireflies surrounding him immediately swarmed forward, covering him completely.

Han Li saw this and tightened his fists, knowing that Huo San was in grave danger.

He saw Huo San's life force flowing away, and his body began to wither, his aura weakening.

Han Li gritted his teeth and swung his hand, releasing 36 Qing Bamboo Hornet Swords that flew out in a row.

The swords transformed into a net of green light, weaving together in mid-air, and swooped down towards the fireflies.

At the same time, Han Li retracted the True Word Treasure Wheel, reversing its speed, and his body suddenly accelerated, moving towards Huo San.

Without the Treasure Wheel's restraint, the fireflies' speed suddenly increased, and the net of swords could only block a portion of them.

Han Li didn't have time to worry about it, and he arrived at Huo San's side, using his Tian Xie Zhen Prison technique to infuse his arms with star power.

He struck the two lamps with a powerful blow, and the lamps exploded, releasing the two dragons that were binding Huo San.

However, the fireflies on Huo San's body suddenly flew away, and those that were chasing Han Li from behind formed a pincer movement.

Han Li was unable to avoid it, and hundreds of fireflies landed on his body.

He didn't have time to swat them away and tried to leave, but his feet were stuck in place.

The flames on the ground suddenly burst into bloom, and a strong temporal law fluctuation emerged, trapping Han Li in place.

The next moment, a ripple appeared in front of him, and Qi Mozi's figure emerged, grasping his collar.

"Finally caught you..." Qi Mozi sneered.

Huo San, who had just regained his freedom, saw this and changed his expression, shouting, "Han brother!"

On the other side, Jiao San, who was covered in fireflies, suddenly released a strong law of reincarnation, and the fireflies' flames dissipated, and they fell to the ground, entering a dormant state.

"Han Dao friend..."

Jiao San frowned, and her body flashed, rushing towards Han Li.

However, she had only moved a hundred feet when the lamps around her suddenly burst into flames, and dragons emerged, blocking her path.
Qimozi gazed at Jiaosan and then glanced at Husan before focusing on Han Li, his voice dripping with mockery: "This time, no one can save you. Go die!"

As he spoke, he grasped Han Li's palm, and a burst of golden flames erupted, engulfing Han Li's entire body in an instant.

"Brother Han..."

Husan's eyes widened in rage as he lunged forward, his Celestial Fox Blood Knife flashing in the air. However, Qimozi casually waved his hand, and a wave of golden flames struck Husan's chest, sending him tumbling backward.

Jiaosan's eyes also blazed with fury, but he could only watch helplessly as Han Li was consumed by the flames.

Qimozi maintained his grip on Han Li's palm, holding him like a torch, as he watched Han Li's body slowly disintegrate into ashes.

The ashes scattered, revealing only black bone powder and no escaping Nascent Soul.

Qimozi sneered, his lips curling upward, and his palm beckoned behind him.

A burst of flames erupted, and a massive golden lotus bloomed, transforming into a colossal cage that sealed off the surrounding space.

Within the golden lotus, a tall figure emerged, and it was Han Li.

"You dare to use a substitute puppet in front of me again?" Qimozi turned to face the trapped Han Li, his face twisted in mockery.

Han Li, confined within the flames, was unable to move or speak, his face contorted in agony.

Qimozi didn't bother to waste words, his body flashing as he entered the golden lotus. His massive hand grasped Han Li's head, and with a slight exertion, his fingers began to whiten.

Han Li's head felt like it was about to explode, and he let out a blood-curdling scream.

Qimozi seemed to relish the sound, his grip tightening.

Han Li's face turned deathly pale, his eyes bulging with bloodshot orbs, as if they would burst at any moment.

Jiaosan's expression changed, and a dark red glow surged from his body as he raised his hand, sending a dark red token flying toward Qimozi.

The token expanded, and Jiaosan infused it with his internal law energy.

The token grew to the size of a door, blocking Qimozi's path, as dark red threads emanated from it, dispelling the surrounding divine lamp illusions.

Husan, who had managed to free himself, followed closely behind Jiaosan, his Celestial Fox Blood Knife radiating intense blood energy.

Qimozi turned to face them, his lips curling into a sneer.

"We're too late..." Jiaosan exclaimed in despair.

As he spoke, Qimozi's grip on Han Li's head tightened, and a burst of golden light flashed, causing Han Li's skull to shatter like a ripe melon.

"Brother Han..." Husan's eyes widened in horror as he let out a deafening roar.

Jiaosan's face also contorted in shock, his eyes filled with incredulity.

Qimozi ignored them, instead pulling out a four-to-five-inch golden figurine from Han Li's remains. The figurine's features were identical to Han Li's, and it was his Nascent Soul.

"Friend Han, you see... the Great Five Elements Fantasy Realm is still mine," Qimozi said, his face filled with triumphant laughter.

The Nascent Soul figurine didn't respond, only struggling to break free.

Qimozi didn't seem to mind, his eyes flashing with a black glow as two thin, black threads emerged from his pupils, wrapping around the Nascent Soul.

However, just as he began to soul-search, Qimozi's expression changed, and the black threads retracted, withdrawing into his eyes.

It was too late, though.

Han Li's lifeless body, which had been shattered by Qimozi, suddenly twisted and contorted, dispersing into nothingness along with the Nascent Soul figurine.

Meanwhile, a blue figure appeared beside Jiaosan, a faint smile on his face. It was the Great Luo Cultivator, Liu Ziyin.

Liu Ziyin's illusory law had combined with Jiaosan's Samsara law, allowing him to deceive Qimozi, who was within his own spiritual realm, at the cost of sacrificing a substitute puppet.
