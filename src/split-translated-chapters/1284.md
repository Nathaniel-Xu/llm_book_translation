After the white mist had completely dissipated, the withered tree was left without any semblance of a refined and dignified old immortal, only a shriveled and blackened, ape-like evil spirit.

Its head was quite large, with a protruding forehead and a pair of bone horns on top, two deep-set eye sockets, a low and flat nose, a protruding mouth, and hair that made it nearly indistinguishable from a monkey. Its skin was covered in old scars.

However, the evil spirit currently looked dejected, with a downtrodden and despairing expression.

"What are you, exactly? And what's your relationship with Xue Lie?" Han Li asked in a deep voice.

"Ah, I won't hide it from you. I am one of the three great lords, the Ghost Witch King, who once guarded a region and oversaw the vengeful spirits along with Xue Lie Wang and Ming Wang. I was deceived by someone and fell for a scheme to isolate us, and I ended up sealing Xue Lie Wang on the Nai He Bridge. Later, I had a falling out with Ming Wang, and that same person manipulated us, leading to my downfall." The evil spirit let out a long sigh and slowly spoke.

After finishing, his gaze fell upon Ti Hu again, still with a scrutinizing look.

"Ghost Witch King?" Han Li's pupils constricted slightly as he looked the evil spirit up and down, a hint of hesitation in his voice as he muttered.

"Don't be polite, just call me Ghost Witch. What's the point of calling me king when I have no soldiers, no power, and no influence?" The evil spirit forced a smile and said.

"I'm not interested in your past stories. I just want to know two things. First, why did you bring us here? Second, do you know the location of the Yan Luo Manor?" Han Li asked.

"I brought you here because I knew you could help me escape my predicament." The evil spirit's eyes lit up as he spoke.

"Help you escape? What makes you think that? Earlier, we were just acting out of kindness when we freed Xue Lie from his seal, and now he's chasing us down." Han Li raised an eyebrow and asked.

"Xue Lie is a fool without a brain! How could I be the same as him? I believe you can help me escape because of Ming Wang's connection, and also because I'm now just a residual soul, no threat to you. You wouldn't be afraid of a mere residual soul, would you?" The evil spirit exclaimed.

"Hey, you keep mentioning Ming Wang. What does he have to do with this?" Jin Tong asked, puzzled.

"It seems that among the three of us, Ming Wang was the one who suffered the worst fate... Xue Lie was sealed, I was almost destroyed, but at least we retained our memories. Ming Wang, however, has already died and been reincarnated." The evil spirit's eyes turned somber as he looked at Ti Hu.

Ti Hu saw this and a hint of confusion flashed in her eyes as she looked at Jin Tong and then at Han Li.

"You're saying she's Ming Wang's reincarnation?" Han Li asked.

"If she weren't Ming Wang's reincarnation, how could she cultivate the Divine Soul Path? And how could she have such an unusual soul aura? Moreover, why would she be attracted to the scattered souls' sand on this island? You might not know, but this sand is actually a remnant of Ming Wang's." The evil spirit sighed and spoke.

"Am I really Ming Wang?" Ti Hu asked, still unsure.

"If you still don't believe me, try using your soul power to summon the gold sand and see how it reacts." The evil spirit said.

Ti Hu looked uncertain, but slowly closed her eyes, and her hands hovered in front of her. A wave of soul power rippled out from her body.

After a moment, the entire island began to shake violently, and the gold sand buried beneath the bone powder began to fly out, forming a golden ribbon dozens of feet long in the air. It fluttered and danced, suspended in mid-air.

Ti Hu slowly opened her eyes, gazing at the golden ribbon, a look of incredulity flashing across her face. As soon as she focused her thoughts, the golden ribbon twisted and fell, wrapping itself around her body in a gentle, affectionate manner.

"See, I didn't lie to you, did I?" The evil spirit's face lit up with a smile.

"Ti Hu, use the gold sand to wrap around the withered tree's roots." Han Li said, unmoved.

Ti Hu never questioned Han Li's orders, and she immediately complied.

"Ah, what are you doing? Why are you turning on me?" The evil spirit wailed, crying out to the heavens.

"Don't pretend anymore. You had Ti Hu take the gold sand to remove the seal on you, didn't you? I'm guessing that there are three seals on you, and the gold sand is one of them. The withered tree is the second, and that box is the third. And your soul is sealed within the box, isn't it?" Han Li sneered.

The evil spirit's expression froze, and then he calmed down, no longer acting wildly. "You're right, the seals are indeed the three I mentioned. And my divine soul is indeed trapped within the box. But I wasn't lying to you, my soul has been damaged over the years, and all that's left is a residual soul that yearns for revenge. I mean no harm to you."

"Why do you think she's Ming Wang's reincarnation?" Han Li asked.

"Perhaps it's because I'm now just a residual soul, and I can sense it more deeply. In short, everything I said is true. This girl, Ti Hu, is indeed Ming Wang's reincarnation. Back then, she was the one who helped destroy my physical body and seal me here, and yet she herself didn't fare much better. It's almost laughable." The evil spirit sneered.
Ti Hun had no recollection of the events Guī Wū mentioned, and thus remained unmoved.

"I let you release me, not just for revenge, but because I don't want to watch the Underworld sink into chaos, causing turmoil in all three realms," Guī Wū said with a sigh.

"What do you mean?" Ti Hun asked.

"You've lost all your memories, but do you still remember the Six Paths Reincarnation Disc?" Guī Wū asked.

"Six Paths Reincarnation Disc?" Ti Hun muttered, still unable to recall anything.

Guī Wū saw her shake her head and said with a hint of frustration, "The Six Paths Reincarnation Disc is one of the Underworld's treasures, a powerful artifact that can control the reincarnation of the six paths. The person who manipulated us three back then was after this very object."

Ti Hun's eyebrows furrowed slightly as she listened, seemingly more interested in Guī Wū's words.

"After we three were eliminated by that person, he declared himself the Wheel King, controlling the three realms. However, he didn't care about the Myriad Ghosts' power and instead used the Six Paths Reincarnation Disc to interfere with the reincarnation of souls, absorbing the power of reincarnation to cultivate his own strength. This act goes against the will of Heaven and Earth, and if continued, will affect not just the Underworld, but all other realms as well," Guī Wū continued.

"How do you know so much about the Underworld's affairs after being sealed here for who-knows-how-many years?" Han Li asked, his eyebrows furrowed in suspicion.

"Shouldn't you have guessed by now? The countless white bones on this island and the many more that have sunk into the river are all the nourishment I've attracted over the years. Otherwise, under such a powerful seal, I wouldn't have been able to preserve even a wisp of my soul," Guī Wū said with a bitter smile.

"It seems many poor souls have been deceived by your words and met a tragic end," Han Li said with a laugh.

"I've managed to hold on until now, but I'm almost exhausted. Fortunately, you've brought the Underworld King. I'm saved, and the Underworld is saved as well..." Guī Wū said, looking at Ti Hun with hope in her eyes.

"What you're saying about past lives and reincarnation, I have no memory of, and I'm not interested," Ti Hun said, her eyebrows furrowed.

The title of Underworld King meant nothing to her, and only her experiences with Han Li in the Spirit Realm were real.

"You've undergone reincarnation and lost your past memories, so naturally, you don't care about what I'm saying. But if you could regain your past memories, I don't think you'd be so indifferent," Guī Wū said.

"Can past memories be regained?" Han Li asked, puzzled.

"If we can reach the shores of the Yellow Spring Lake and find the Six Paths Reincarnation Disc, we can use this treasure to reveal your past memories. Once you awaken to your past memories, you can use the reincarnation technique to regain your past cultivation experience, and your Law power will surely improve. At that time, I'll persuade Blood Li, and we three will reunite, forming an alliance to defeat the Wheel King and reclaim the Underworld's three realms," Guī Wū said, her eyes shining with excitement.

Ti Hun's eyes flickered with hesitation as she listened, seemingly wavering.

"The Underworld King's return, Blood Li's unsealing, and our reunion – don't you think it's all too convenient? This is the fate of reincarnation, bringing us together once more..." Guī Wū said, trying to persuade Ti Hun.

Ti Hun looked at Han Li, seemingly uncertain.

"Although I'm not interested in the Underworld's struggles, the Six Paths Reincarnation Disc does seem intriguing. Let's go take a look. However, before that, we need to find the Yama's Palace," Han Li said, nodding.

"Finding the Yama's Palace is no problem," Guī Wū said.

"You know the location of the Yama's Palace?" Han Li asked, his eyebrows raised in surprise.

"If you're quick, it's only half a month's journey from here. At most, it'll take a month," Guī Wū said after a moment of thought.

Han Li's face remained unchanged, but he seemed to be considering it.

"As long as you agree to help me, I'll take you to the Yama's Palace after we reach the Six Paths Reincarnation Disc," Guī Wū said, adding, "Please help me unseal the restriction."

Han Li finally nodded, agreeing to help Guī Wū.

"Now that we've formed an alliance, please help me unseal the restriction," Guī Wū said, her face filled with joy.

"This scattered soul sand is easy to dispel, Ti Hun can handle it with a wave of her hand. However, the two restrictions behind it are quite peculiar – do you know how to remove them, Guī Wū?" Han Li asked.
