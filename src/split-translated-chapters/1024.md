"You are the Tian Yin Five Sons? Each of you report your name." Han Li ignored the Golden Immortal cultivators and looked at the five old men, his voice cold and stern.

"I am Yin Tianhu, I hope Han Dao friend will spare my life, we really didn't know about the affair between you and the East Palace Master." The five men looked at each other, and the one on the far left, an old man with a flattering smile, bowed to Han Li.

Although the five men looked similar, they had some differences, and each of them wore a black jade ring on their hand, which seemed to be a storage ring. The ring on the old man's hand had a tiger character on it.

"I am Yin Tianlu, nice to meet you, Han Dao friend." The old man next to him, wearing a ring with a deer character, also showed a flattering smile.

"I am Yin Tianxiong." The old man next to Yin Tianlu, with a slightly square face, spoke calmly.

"Hmph! I am Yin Tianyuan, since I'm not as skilled as you, do as you please, kill or torture me." The old man on the far right, with a proud expression, sneered.

"Fourth brother, don't be reckless!" Yin Tianhu's face changed, and he scolded.

At this moment, the last person's body suddenly glowed with a bloody light, and his body shrunk rapidly, dodging the sword light that was about to behead him. He then transformed into a bloody shadow and escaped at an incredible speed.

However, he didn't escape far, and the sword light appeared beside him, striking him with a speed that was several times faster than his escape. With a loud "bang", his body exploded into a mess of blood.

"Fourth brother!"

"Han Dao friend, spare his life!"

The remaining four men were shocked, and they cried out in alarm.

Han Li remained still, and a silver light flashed behind him, revealing a black figure, which was Qiuhun.

She grasped at the air with her hands, and her palms glowed with a bloody light, forming two crimson rings that emitted a devouring force.

With a "whoosh", a ball of soul light shot out from the blood, and Qiuhun caught it.

Along with the soul, the storage ring on the deceased's hand also flew into Qiuhun's hand, with a eagle character on it.

The other four men saw this and changed their expressions, instinctively wanting to do something, but they saw the sword light on their necks and became obedient.

"We cultivators have taken many lives, this is nothing, but what I, Han Li, hate the most is those who slaughter the weak and innocent. Anyone who has done such a thing will not be spared today! You Tian Yin Five Sons are famous, and I made you report your names so that you can die with clarity!" Han Li said calmly.

The four men heard this and changed their expressions, wanting to escape, but Han Li's gaze made them freeze.

"The one who tried to escape was Yin Tianying, right? He slaughtered over a hundred mortal cities to refine a blood path immortal artifact, and killed countless innocent people. He is not worthy of sympathy." Han Li said slowly.

The four men heard this and were shocked, wondering how Han Li knew about Yin Tianying's secret.

"Yin Tianhu, you once cultivated in the Cangyun Mountains, using the yin energy to break through your bottleneck. You slaughtered a small sect, the Jinfeng Sect, which had over two thousand people, just to take their cultivation site. Is this true?" Han Li looked at Yin Tianhu.

"Dao friend, I think there's been a misunderstanding, I..." Yin Tianhu's face turned white, unable to speak.

"Yin Tianlu, you refined a demonic treasure, the Child Mother Pursuit Soul Banner, using the blood of pregnant women who were over six months pregnant. I'm not mistaken, am I?" Han Li ignored Yin Tianhu and looked at Yin Tianlu.

Yin Tianlu's face turned pale, and his body trembled uncontrollably.

"Yin Tianxiong, don't pretend to be a righteous person, I've already investigated, you have a sinister nature, and you cultivate the demonic technique, the Yin-Yang Harmony Sutra. In the past few years, many female disciples from the large sects in the Golden Source Domain have gone missing, and you've been secretly capturing them to absorb their yin energy." Han Li turned to Yin Tianxiong, his voice cold.

Yin Tianxiong's body shook, and his face lost all its color.

"And you, Yin Tianyuan, you may not have killed people for your own desires, but you're a loyal dog of Dongfang Bai, and you've slaughtered countless tribes and sects on his orders. You're not worthy of sympathy." Han Li finally looked at Yin Tianyuan.

"You've investigated thoroughly, but I've already made a profit, I've destroyed dozens of sects and tribes, and I'm not afraid of death. You can kill me if you want!" Yin Tianyuan sneered, his eyes gleaming with a fierce light.

Han Li sneered, about to strike down the four men.

Just then, a blood-red glow appeared on Yin Tianyuan's face, and his laughter became sharp and shrill, like a monkey's cry.

This laughter contained a strange power, and Han Li's eardrums felt like they were being pierced by a steel needle, causing him intense pain. Even with his current physical strength, he hesitated for a moment.

Yin Tianhu, Yin Tianlu, and Yin Tianxiong quickly retreated, escaping the sword light's restraint.
Yin Tian Yuan suddenly broke free from the electric arc sword light, but instead of retreating, he charged towards Han Li.

"This person's strength is too great, I'll hold him back, you all quickly escape!" Yin Tian Yuan shouted, and his entire body turned blood red as he swelled up, transforming into a large blood-red ball that charged towards Han Li.

"Fourth brother!" Yin Tian Xiong's eyes turned red as he watched the scene, and he was about to turn back to help, but was held back by Yin Tian Hu.

"Fourth brother has used the Red Lotus Self-Destruction, he can't be saved, do you want his death to be in vain? Quickly leave!" Yin Tian Hu shouted, and pulled Yin Tian Xiong as they flew away.

At this moment, a loud muffled sound echoed, and a dazzling blood-red light mixed with a rolling storm burst forth.

Han Li silently retracted his fist, his face calm, as a layer of crystal membrane appeared on his body.

The flying blood storm that hit his body was easily blocked by the crystal membrane, and his clothes were not damaged in the slightest.

Yin Tian Hu and the others saw this scene, and their hearts were shocked, Yin Tian Xiong no longer mentioned going back to help, and the three of them immediately fled in different directions.

Yin Tian Hu's body suddenly ignited with a layer of black flames, and he transformed into a large black fireball, flying forward with incredible speed.

Yin Tian Lu swallowed a cyan-colored pill, and as soon as it entered his stomach, a cyan-colored giant deer's shadow appeared on his body, and he let out a loud cry, his four hooves flying as he transformed into a cyan rainbow, shooting forward with incredible speed.

Yin Tian Xiong reacted quickly, and a layer of black light like water waves appeared on his body, and he instantly became transparent, flashing into the ground and disappearing from sight.

Han Li saw this scene, and his left hand struck out with a fist, his right hand weaving a spell, and a crystal light flashed on his forehead, as a blurry sword shadow shot out, disappearing into the void in front of him.

Yin Tian Hu had just flown out a few thousand meters when the void behind him rippled, and a golden fist shadow the size of a house appeared, striking him with incredible speed.

A loud explosion echoed, and Yin Tian Hu's body, along with the black flames outside, burst apart, turning into a bloody rain.

Almost at the same time, a golden light flashed in front of Yin Tian Lu, and an electric arc sword light shot out, cutting towards him.

Yin Tian Lu was fleeing forward, and had not expected the sword light to appear in front of him, and the speed was too fast, he was unable to dodge.

With a soft "chi" sound, Yin Tian Lu's body was instantly cut in half.

In the underground, Yin Tian Xiong was fleeing with all his might, when a crystal light flashed beside him, and a crystal sword shadow appeared, striking down with incredible speed.

A scream echoed from the underground, and then there was silence.

Ti Hou saw this scene, and her hands moved, as a blood-red light appeared in her palms.

A soft "whoosh" sound echoed, and three soul lights flew out from different directions, falling into her hands.

Yin Tian Xiong's soul, which had entered the underground, was cut off by the soul-cutting sword, and completely disappeared.

She now held four soul lights in her hands, which were constantly changing in size, emitting strong soul fluctuations, struggling with all their might, but unable to leave her hands.

"Don't be in a hurry to eat, first check their memories," Han Li said calmly, looking at Ti Hou.

He had come to the Golden Source Immortal Palace to kill Dong Fang Bai and others, to avenge the Qing Huo tribe and others, and also because the Golden Source Immortal Palace had a cross-domain transmission array that connected to other immortal domains.

Now that he had completely exposed his tracks, continuing to stay in the Golden Source Immortal Domain would only lead to more pursuit, so he wanted to use the transmission array to quickly leave the Golden Source Immortal Domain.

"These four people have been rampaging in the Golden Source Immortal Domain, doing all sorts of evil, I won't eat their souls, after searching their souls, I'll refine them into soul vessels, and torment them for 10,000 years," Ti Hou said, her face cold and her voice icy.

As soon as she finished speaking, she began to chant, and a black mist appeared in her hands, wrapping around the four soul lights, as she began to search their souls.

Han Li saw this, and no longer paid attention to Ti Hou, as a golden thunder light enveloped her, and he transformed into a golden electric light, chasing after Dong Fang Bai.

He had captured the Yin Tian five brothers, and had clearly stated that they would be executed for their crimes, but in reality, it had only taken a short time, and Dong Fang Bai had not escaped his divine sense range.

Han Li had locked onto Dong Fang Bai's tracks with his divine sense, and was using his thunder escape technique to chase after him, and soon caught up to him from behind, a few hundred miles away.

"Hmph! You think you can escape?" Han Li coldly snorted, and swept his sleeve.

Seventy-two electric arc sword lights flashed and merged into one, transforming into a thick electric light, its speed increasing several times.

A loud thunderous sound echoed, and the thick electric light caught up to Dong Fang Bai, striking down with incredible force.
