The void storm at the Years Tower finally subsided, disappearing without a trace after a brief period of intense turbulence. The surroundings returned to calm, as if nothing had happened, except for the massive, dark pit that now scarred the ground, a testament to the recent events.

The pit was shrouded in darkness, its depths unknown. Han Li's eyes suddenly lit up, as if he had discovered something, and he immediately darted towards the pit, disappearing into its depths.

A few breaths later, he shot out of the pit, holding an object in his hand â€“ the Years Lamp. Despite having endured the spatial storm, the lamp showed no signs of damage, although its flame had been extinguished, and the temporal law fluctuations it emitted had weakened significantly.

"Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Han, on recovering the Years Lamp," Jiao San said, bowing his head, "though it seems to have suffered some damage."

"I'm already satisfied with having retrieved the lamp," Han Li replied, putting the lamp away.

Hei Tian Mo Zu, the Black Sky Demon Ancestor, returned at this moment, his face flushed with excitement, while Qu Xuan, the Horned Dragon, trailed behind him, his face pale and resentful.

"Fellow Daoists, although we've escaped the Years Tower, we're still within the Tai Sui Immortal Mansion. Judging from the mansion's spatial structure, I estimate it won't last much longer. The destruction caused by the tower's collapse is already immense; if the entire mansion were to collapse, the consequences would be catastrophic. We should leave as soon as possible," Jiao San said, looking at the group.

The others nodded in agreement.

"Leaving this place is a given, but how do we do it? You don't have the necessary cultivation to sense it, but the entire Tai Sui Immortal Mansion is currently being enveloped by a massive spatial force. Breaking through won't be easy," Liu Zi said, glancing at the group.

Jiao San smiled faintly, about to respond.

Just then, a group of people appeared in the distance, flying towards them. There were only 20-30 people, with the others either having fallen or gone elsewhere. The group was diverse, consisting of humans, demons, and other creatures, all of whom looked emaciated and wretched, as if they had been starved for a long time.

Han Li's brow furrowed as he gazed at the group.

Although they didn't possess any law energy, their auras were immense, comparable to those of Tai Yi realm cultivators. Li Qi and the others exchanged wary glances.

"Fellow Daoists, are you also people who were sealed within the Years Tower? What brings you here?" Jiao San asked, his expression unchanged.

"We were imprisoned for countless years, and now that we've finally escaped, we don't want to die here. Can you take us with you when you leave?" a human with red hair and a gaunt face asked, his eyes pleading.

The others also begged for their help.

"Don't worry, we won't abandon you. We've met by chance, and we'll leave together," Jiao San said, his voice loud and clear.

The group thanked him, relief written on their faces.

"Jiao San, you seem to have a way to leave this place," Liu Zi said, turning to him.

"I came here to complete a task for the Wheel of Reincarnation, so I naturally have a way to leave. However, setting it up will take some time," Jiao San replied, producing a stack of silver array flags and disks, each emitting powerful spatial law fluctuations.

"The Great Transference Array! The Wheel of Reincarnation is indeed wealthy and powerful," Liu Zi exclaimed, his eyes shining with admiration.

Jiao San smiled faintly, about to begin setting up the array.

Just then, the entire mansion's spatial structure began to violently shake, the cracks in the sky growing larger and brighter. A dazzling golden light burst forth, illuminating the surroundings.

The ground trembled, and massive fissures appeared, the mansion's structure beginning to collapse. Han Li and the others quickly flew upwards, their faces pale.

"How can this be? The mansion's spatial structure should have been able to withstand this for at least two or three more days. Could someone be interfering?" Jiao San exclaimed, his expression changing.

"Never mind the reason, quickly set up the array! We'll resist the surrounding shocks and won't let them affect you!" Liu Zi urged.

"Alright!"

Jiao San nodded, and began setting up the array with swift, precise movements. His hands moved in a blur as he deployed the array flags and disks, which shot out and inserted themselves into the nearby void, forming a silver array.

A brilliant silver light burst forth, creating a massive silver pillar that shot upwards, supporting the surrounding space. The others flew to the periphery, surrounding Jiao San and protecting him from the turbulence.

In the distance, three figures stood in the void, watching Han Li and the others with an air of detachment, unaffected by the surrounding chaos.
Half a day later.

The turmoil in the Jin Yuan mountain range finally subsided, and the entire mountain range gradually calmed down.

Dao Yin Zhenren and his group hovered tens of thousands of miles away, looking down at the earth below, their faces filled with distress, unable to bear the sight.

Below, the Jin Yuan mountain range, on the left, still had its majestic mountains and lush forests, but on the right, the mountains were broken, the rivers had changed course, and the peaks were overturned, with all living things dead and silent, and the landscape was scarred.

"Living beings are suffering, this is a great sin!" Dao Yin Zhenren's eyes were filled with sorrow, and he sighed heavily.

"Master, this is not our fault, this is the will of the Heavenly Court, we cannot disobey. Moreover, we have tried our best, but unfortunately, we were not successful." Chen Chuan saw the situation and frowned, trying to comfort him.

At this time, everyone's gaze looked far away, and they saw a figure in the distance, flying towards them through the layers of smoke and dust.

"Lei Shixiong..." Chen Chuan's eyes flashed with joy, and he said.

The person was indeed Lei Yuzce, but at this time, he was also covered in dust, looking somewhat disheveled.

Everyone knew the reason, so they didn't say anything more.

Su Xianxian saw the situation and stood beside him, not saying anything.

...

Just then, the sky above the original Qing Si Valley suddenly shook, and a rift opened up.

A silver light flashed, and over 40 figures emerged from the rift.

The first person to appear was a man with tattered clothes and disheveled hair, looking somewhat crazy. As soon as he appeared, he shouted loudly: "Good guy, you're still making such a big commotion with just a wisp of residual soul..."

This person was none other than the Great Black Heaven Demon Ancestor.

Behind him, the people who appeared were also covered in dust, looking disheveled, including Han Li and Jiao San, as well as the 30 or so Tai Yi realm cultivators who were originally imprisoned.

"It's been so many years... finally... finally, we're out!"

"We're free... we're finally free!"

Han Li and the others didn't say anything, but the 30 or so Tai Yi realm cultivators from various tribes were filled with excitement, and some even cried tears of joy.

"Thank you, benefactor, for saving us from the brink of disaster!"

"Thank you, benefactor, for saving us from the brink of disaster!"

Someone shouted, and the others followed, bowing down to Jiao San.

"You don't have to do this, it was just a small effort. What are your plans now?" Jiao San waved his hand and said.

"We were imprisoned for so many years, and we don't know what the situation is like outside. Our original sects may not even exist anymore... it's likely that we have nowhere to go." The red-haired, thin man smiled bitterly and said.

The others also sighed in unison.

"If you have a place to go, you can leave now. If you don't have a place to go, you can follow me later, and I'll arrange a place for you." Jiao San said again.

At this time, except for the 7 or 8 people who bid farewell to Jiao San, the remaining 20 or so people chose to stay.

Han Li didn't pay attention to the conversation between Jiao San and the imprisoned cultivators.

At this time, he was hovering high in the air, looking down at the earth below, his face filled with a difficult expression. The land below was scorched, and the mountains were gone, leaving behind only a vast, barren wasteland.

The original White Head Valley had been completely destroyed, turned into a massive crater hundreds of miles in diameter.

The crater was filled with ravines and gorges, and the rocks had been shattered into black powder. The surrounding area was devoid of any living creatures.

The massive mountain range that had once stretched across the land was now gone, almost completely flattened, leaving behind only a small, black mountain range that was still emitting smoke and flames.

Standing beside Han Li, Lan Xian's face turned white, and she couldn't speak.

"Who could have done this? The entire secret realm has been completely destroyed, and the mountain range has been almost completely flattened!" Jiao San asked, looking at the desolate landscape.

"Judging from the situation, it's likely that the Tong Tian Sword Sect is involved. But did they really need to do something so drastic?" Han Li was also puzzled, and he muttered to himself.

"It's unlikely, the Tong Tian Sword Sect is based in the Jin Yuan mountain range, and even if their sect is not here, this place is still related to them. They wouldn't do something so reckless, without considering the consequences." Huo San thought for a moment, shaking his head.

"Not necessarily, the Tong Tian Sword Sect and the Tian Shui Sect were able to rise to power in the Jin Yuan immortal realm because of their strong abilities, but also because of their loyalty to the Heavenly Court. If not for this, the Jin Yuan immortal realm, a mid-sized immortal realm, would not have been entrusted to the care of the Eastern White, a Tai Yi peak cultivator." Jiao San's eyes narrowed, and he said.

"Even so, it's hard to believe that they would be so ruthless. It's likely that the Heavenly Court was involved." Han Li pondered for a moment, and then said.
