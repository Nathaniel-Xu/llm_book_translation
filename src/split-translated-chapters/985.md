Regarding the items Han Li gave her, Zi Ling did not refuse this time. After taking the jade slips and briefly examining them, her pretty face changed.

Although her cultivation was not high, she had been in the Black River Water Palace and the Puppet City, so her knowledge was not ordinary.

The cultivation methods on these jade slips were extremely precious. Any one of them, if spread, would be a treasure fought over by countless people.

"You have cultivated the Puppet Heart of Puppet City to a quite high level, but when it comes to tempering divine consciousness, no matter how many realms you traverse, no cultivation method can compare to the Soul Refining Technique. If you can cultivate it, it will surely be of great help to your puppet manipulation skills. However, this cultivation method also has its disadvantages. I have recorded everything in the jade slip. How to choose is up to you. Don't relax in the cultivation of the Heavenly execution Prison Skill. In the future, after leaving the Jilin Empty Realm, you will still have to rely on cultivation to determine victory or defeat. First, clear the Profound Orifice, then impact the Immortal Orifice will be much easier." Han Li carefully instructed.

"I understand." Zi Ling nodded and kept the jade slips close to her body.

"As for those two cultivation methods, I obtained them from a Demon Race Daluo. Although you can't cultivate them now, they are quite compatible with your physique, so you can save them for later. The first two cultivation methods can be cultivated now, especially in the Jilin Empty Realm where the power of the stars is rich. It's the best environment for cultivating the Heavenly Execution Prison Skill. You might as well stay here with me to protect Crab Daoist friend. I can also give you some pointers." Han Li said again.

"No, I plan to return to Sha City Lord first. My puppet manipulation skills have not yet reached a profound level. I need her to continue teaching me to improve, otherwise my previous efforts will have been in vain. As for the cultivation methods you gave me, I will arrange them properly. Moreover, I can take care of myself, you don't have to worry." Zi Ling looked away and said calmly.

"In that case, keep this too. I took it from someone in your Puppet City before. It's quite powerful. And since this is something I'm giving you, even if Sha Xin knows, she won't dare say anything. You keep it for your own protection." Han Li then took out a golden ball and handed it to Zi Ling. It was the Golden Winged Owl Puppet.

"Golden Winged Owl!" Zi Ling saw the golden ball, her beautiful eyes moved, but she did not refuse. She took the ball and put it away.

"You've given me so many things, I have nothing to repay you with, so I'll give you a small gift in return." She hesitated for a moment, then took out an object and handed it over.

Han Li took the object, but it was a green jade pendant, crystal clear like water, and it looked like it was made of extraordinary material.

But this jade pendant was not complete, it seemed to be only half, and the broken mouth was jagged, as if it had been forcibly broken off.

In the center of the jade pendant, a group of light and shadow emerged, vaguely revealing the image of a person.

"Zi Ling, this..." Han Li's face changed slightly, and he looked up at Zi Ling.

"You don't need to worry about this matter, I will handle it myself, I'm just telling you today." Zi Ling said calmly, her voice light but full of determination.

As soon as the words fell, she turned and walked outside.

Han Li stepped forward, as if wanting to reach out to stop her, but in the end he stopped his steps, looked at the jade pendant in his hand, and sighed.

Zi Ling quickly left the underground space and came outside.

Outside the entrance, a group of people was standing at this moment, including Sha Xin, Six Flowers Madam and others, Zhuo Ge, Black Big, Black Two also came to this place, surrounding Sha Xin.

"City Lord." Zi Ling came to Sha Xin's side and bowed.

"Zi Ling, how did you come out? How is the owner inside?" Sha Xin looked surprised and hurriedly got up to help Zi Ling.

"That senior is still recovering. I talked with Li Daoist friend and then came out." Zi Ling said calmly.

"Zi Ling, I previously sealed your divine soul. Although it was for Puppet City, the consideration was indeed inadequate. I hope you don't take it to heart." Sha Xin slowly nodded, held Zi Ling's hand, and said apologetically.

"City Lord, please don't say that, I understand." Zi Ling said.

"What are your plans for the future?" Hearing this, Sha Xin's heart secretly relaxed, and then she asked.

"I am willing to continue to follow the City Lord." Zi Ling said firmly.

......

In the underground cave, after Zi Ling left, the blood lake suddenly churned up a whirlpool.

The blood-colored crystal stone plate then sank down, bringing Han Li with it into the lake water below.

Below the blood pool, a spell formation flashed with light.

Then, Han Li and Crab Daoist appeared together in a large crystal palace.

The walls of the palace were transparent and flawless, showing a faint crystal red color, covered with various patterns, looking like a large crystal coffin.

The blood-colored crystal stone plate carrying Crab Daoist's sacred bones fit perfectly with a half-man-high stone platform on the ground, linking the patterns together, looking like one.

On the ground of the crystal palace, there were also three circular trenches, also engraved with complex patterns.
The entire palace seemed to be a vast stellar formation.

With a glance, Han Li couldn't help but raise his eyebrows, only to discover that Yue Qiu's corpse was lying in a circular trench not far away.

"Brother Han, although I have now merged with this corpse, it is far from being resurrected. I need to recuperate here to achieve true resurrection. As I said before, I still need you to guard me for some time." The holy body on the blood-colored crystal stone suddenly spoke.

"Why me, and not Sha Xin? Isn't she your subordinate? It seems that she has been very loyal to you over the years, always wanting to resurrect you." Han Li frowned and asked.

"Yue Qiu was once my trusted subordinate, ordered to guard this place for me, but in the end... he colluded with the Demon Lord and almost destroyed this place. Now, the only person I trust is you, Brother Han." Crab Daoist shook his head and said.

"I have one thing that I don't understand. What is your relationship with the Demon Lord, and why did he harm you?" Han Li asked again.

"This matter... is a long story. Let's wait until I fully recover before I tell you in detail. There are two side halls on the left and right of the Falling Star Crystal Palace. One was where I used to study the mysteries of the Dao and puppet techniques. The books and materials stored there are still intact and have not been affected. You can read them freely. The other was where I used to cultivate. You can also go into seclusion there." Crab Daoist hesitated for a moment and continued.

Han Li didn't ask any more questions and nodded in agreement.

A moment later, a circular formation above the crystal palace lit up with a starlight, and then, like a prairie fire, it instantly ignited the entire formation.

The four walls and the ground of the crystal palace were filled with stars, as if a vast galaxy had emerged. The vast power of the stars gathered from all directions.

All the patterns on the blood-colored crystal stone and the stone platform below lit up, and a layer of hazy light immediately gathered from them, turning into a blood-colored barrier that enveloped the Crab Daoist's holy body.

At the same time, the sound of flowing water came from the trenches on the ground of the crystal palace.

The lake of blood containing pure blood power also gathered from somewhere, filling the three circular trenches and converging towards the blood-colored stone platform in the center.

Han Li could clearly feel that the vast power in the blood was slowly fusing into the body.

Just then, a "bang" sound came.

When Han Li looked over, he found that in the outer trench, Yue Qiu's body suddenly burst open, and pieces of flesh and bones were sucked onto the crystal wall of the trench by a strange force.

Under the constant flushing of the blood, his flesh began to dissolve rapidly, and even the bones were slowly melting. All the power in the remains turned into pure blood energy and fused into the entire formation.

At this moment, Han Li suddenly felt his heart tremble violently, and his face became extremely flushed.

His expression changed slightly, and he silently activated the star power in his body, turned around, and walked towards the right side hall.

Han Li passed through a crystal stone door and entered the side hall, immediately sitting down cross-legged.

At this moment, the blood in his body was raging in his veins, and all the blood seemed to be boiling. The skin on the surface of his body seemed to be burning, and layers of hot pink heat were constantly evaporating from his pores.

Including the mountain giant ape, thunder roc, true dragon, and other true spirit bloodlines, they all began to riot in his body and seemed to be uncontrollable, all showing signs of exploding.

Han Li immediately activated the Heavenly Devil Imprisoning Skill, mobilized all the star power in his body, and tried to suppress it.

As a result, it was better not to activate it. As soon as he activated it, the true spirit bloodlines in his body immediately became more violent, as if they had been injected with a powerful medicine, causing Han Li's bones to make cracking sounds.

"What's going on?" Han Li was stunned and extremely surprised.

He thought about it for a moment, and only then did he remember that when he was fighting against Yue Qiu, it was when he activated the Heavenly Devil Imprisoning Skill that the true spirit bloodline's power greatly increased. It seemed that there was indeed a connection between the two.

But now that the true spirit bloodline was backlashing, it would be counterproductive to stimulate it like this.

In addition to being shocked, Han Li immediately stopped the operation of the technique and only used his mental power to draw the star power in his body and disperse it to various parts of his body to help calm the turbulent blood.

Two hours later, the true spirit bloodline that was rioting and counterattacking in Han Li's body gradually subsided. Han Li slowly opened his eyes and exhaled a long breath, but his face was still flushed with blood.

"I didn't expect the true spirit bloodline to backlash at this time. It will be troublesome in the future..." Han Li sighed.

As he spoke, he stood up and looked around.

In the center of the hall, there were several white jade bookshelves about a foot high, with a total of eight columns, arranged in a radial pattern towards the center of the hall, filled with all kinds of books.

In the center of the hall, there was a crystal pagoda less than a foot high, with a total of eight corners and nine layers, surrounded by spiritual light, looking extremely beautiful.
