You have it, Wu Shuang Island... the Black Reef waters have an island called 'Wu Shuang' that is surrounded by dense reefs, with towering waves and a barren landscape devoid of vegetation and life. As a result, the surrounding area is uninhabited for thousands of miles. Luo Feng pondered for a moment before speaking.

"I need your help to build a formation on Wu Shuang Island," Han Li said directly.

"At your command," Luo Feng replied, clasping his hands.

Han Li nodded and took out a detailed diagram and a black storage ring, handing them over. "The formation's diagram is here, and the materials needed are also included. You must complete it within seven days."

"I'll get right on it," Luo Feng said, receiving the items and glancing at the diagram before his expression changed.

"Not so fast, I also have some cultivation techniques and spiritual herbs for Wu Meng Island. You can take them too," Han Li said, tossing over a white storage ring.

"Thank you, Lord Liu..." Luo Feng caught the ring and bowed without even looking at it.

After Luo Feng left, Han Li's gaze fell on the Earthly Spirit's incarnation. The latter seemed to sense something and looked up, meeting Han Li's eyes.

Han Li gazed at the incarnation, which looked almost identical to himself, and felt a pang of nostalgia.

This incarnation was created by Han Li's own divine soul and the Birth Soul Flower, and had developed some independent consciousness. After being separated from Han Li for so long, its cultivation had grown, and its consciousness had become more complete.

In a sense, the incarnation was both Han Li and not Han Li.

If Han Li had fallen in the mortal realm, as long as the incarnation existed, Han Li wouldn't be considered truly dead.

Because Han Li could reclaim absolute control over the incarnation at any time through their divine soul connection, he didn't need to worry about the incarnation rebelling.

Of course, this was a last resort, and if the incarnation lost its sense of self, it wouldn't be able to guard Wu Meng Island like it did now.

"I have a request," Han Li said after a moment.

"You and I are one, what need is there to speak of requests? Just say what's on your mind," the Earthly Spirit's incarnation replied, its expression unchanged.

Han Li hesitated, then lightly touched his face.

As a blue glow passed over him, the seal on his face was lifted, revealing his true appearance.

A dark mist swirled at his brow, with a strange symbol at its center. His eyes flashed with bloody light, and his pupils seemed to emanate a strong, murderous aura.

The Earthly Spirit's incarnation stared at the symbol, shocked, and felt like it was gazing at a ferocious, evil face that seemed to be about to break free from Han Li's flesh.

"What is this...?"

The Earthly Spirit's incarnation was separated from Han Li's divine soul, and despite their connection, it had no idea what it was looking at.

Then, it frowned, shocked, and asked, "Your cultivation realm?"

Han Li's true cultivation realm was now fully revealed, and the Earthly Spirit's incarnation was astonished.

"I'm currently stuck at the peak of the Great Luo Initial Stage, being harassed by the evil corpse, and facing the Corpse Severing tribulation," Han Li said, his voice laced with a bitter smile.

"Great Luo, a Great Luo cultivator..." Even the Earthly Spirit's incarnation found it hard to believe.

Normally, those who walked the Earthly Spirit path, with the support of their followers' faith, would have an easier time cultivating. As long as they had enough followers, their cultivation speed would be faster.

In recent times, due to the unique environment of the Black Wind Sea, and Han Li's foundation, Wu Meng Island's power and followers had grown rapidly.

Thanks to this, the Earthly Spirit's incarnation's cultivation speed was not slow, but compared to Han Li, it was almost insignificant.

"So, you're saying I can help you with the Corpse Severing?" the Earthly Spirit's incarnation asked, its expression thoughtful.

"Yes, that's right. The difficulty of Corpse Severing lies in how to contend with the corpse's soul and sever it from the body. The three corpses are the root of one's attachments, and their power grows with the cultivator's growth. It's extremely difficult to sever them with one's own divine soul. I obtained a secret technique that can transfer the evil corpse into your body, greatly increasing the chances of success," Han Li explained.

"What's the risk?" the Earthly Spirit's incarnation asked directly.

"The Corpse Severing process is already a risk, and if we're not careful, my original divine soul might be consumed by the evil corpse, changing my nature. Even if we succeed, there's a high chance that the evil corpse will occupy your Earthly Spirit body," Han Li said.
Here is the translation of the chapter:

"Is that so, then it's only me who will serve as the vessel for this ritual?" Di Qi's avatar furrowed its brow and asked.

"That's correct," Han Li nodded and replied.

"If it were you, would you agree to it?" Di Qi's avatar showed a hint of a strange expression and asked.

"Actually, it's not entirely without benefits for you. The U-Meng Island's sea area has so many islanders who believe in you, I think the main reason you haven't been able to break through to the Tai Yi realm is that the power of their faith is limited, and it's not enough to help you break through the boundary, right?" Han Li asked.

"That's correct," Di Qi's avatar replied after a moment of silence, nodding its head.

"I have a way to help you break free from the constraints of your Earthly Immortal body, and from then on, you won't need to rely on the power of faith," Han Li said.

"Back then, who was it that forged this body of mine, I think no one is clearer about it than you. And the connection between this Earthly Immortal body and U-Meng Island, I think no one is clearer about it than you, so how can you say that it's possible to sever it?" Di Qi's avatar shook its head, clearly not believing Han Li's words.

"This I naturally understand, after so many years of cultivation, the connection between your Earthly Immortal body and U-Meng Island will only become tighter. However, you don't know that the energy carried by the evil corpse is incredibly powerful, once it enters your body, it will definitely modify your Earthly Immortal body to better suit you, and using the power of the evil corpse to sever the connection to the power of faith is not a difficult task," Han Li said.

Di Qi's avatar heard this and fell into deep thought, and after a long while, it asked, "Is this really possible?"

"Even if I don't dare to say it's 90% certain, there's still a 70-80% chance," Han Li nodded.

"If the connection to the power of faith is severed, what will happen to the islanders of U-Meng Island?" Di Qi's avatar asked.

"Not to mention that Luo Feng is now a True Immortal-level cultivator, if you're willing to protect them, staying here for a hundred years, with the immortal plants and magical tools I'll leave for them, it will be enough to make them not fear any power in the Black Wind Sea. Moreover, severing the connection to the ancestral god's path might not be a bad thing for them," Han Li said.

Di Qi's avatar heard this and nodded its head after a long while, seeming to accept Han Li's words.

"This matter is simple to say, but in reality, it's not easy. First, your current body may not be able to withstand the enormous energy brought by the evil corpse, and second, if your soul is not protected, it will definitely be devoured by the evil corpse and become its prey," Han Li continued.

"You should already have a plan to deal with this, right?" Di Qi's avatar asked.

"That's correct, the large array that Luo Feng built earlier is for tempering your Earthly Immortal body. As for your soul, before I perform the ritual, I will seal it away with a secret method, and at that time, you will fall into a deep sleep, and the evil corpse won't be able to detect your existence, so it naturally won't attack you," Han Li said.

"Fall into a deep sleep..." Di Qi's avatar hesitated.

"Don't worry, before that, I will seal your physical body on Tian Shuang Island, and the evil corpse will only be able to break free after it has modified and controlled your Earthly Immortal body. At that time, I will have already stabilized my cultivation at the mid-stage of the Da Luo realm, and capturing it will be a simple matter. Afterwards, I will only need to use a secret method to extract it again and re-seal it," Han Li said with a smile.

"So, there's one more key point, which is that you must stabilize your cultivation at the mid-stage of the Da Luo realm before the evil corpse breaks free from your control?" Di Qi's avatar frowned.

"Compared to the risks before, this is not a problem for me," Han Li said confidently.

"It's settled then," Di Qi's avatar said after thinking for a moment.

Han Li heard this and relaxed his expression, and in his heart, he couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief.

It was not easy to convince oneself, after all, to be able to fully cooperate with oneself, one could only achieve the best effect of the Corpse Severing Technique.

...

Time passed, and it was already seven days later.

In the Black Wind Sea, a region of water with a black glow, there were patches of black coral reefs, some of which were completely hidden beneath the surface, while others protruded above the water.

In other areas of the sea, the waves were calm, but here, the water churned and foamed, creating massive waves that reached hundreds of feet high.

In the center of this black coral reef, there was a strange, grayish-white island.

The island's surface near the sea was covered in black coral, while the higher areas were grayish-white, as if a layer of frost had been added.

At this moment, three or four figures flew overhead, descending onto the island.

One of them was a blue-robed man, and another was a blue-clothed man, who looked very similar, but were actually Han Li and his Di Qi avatar.

The other two were Luo Feng and Jin Tong.

The group arrived at the center of the island, where they found that the original island peak had been completely flattened, and a spacious area had been created, with a blue, six-sided altar built in the center, several dozen feet high.
