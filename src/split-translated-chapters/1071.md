There were nine items on the stone table, all of which were spiritual materials, emitting astonishing aura fluctuations.

"That black lotus is the You Shui Xian Lotus! One of the top ten Xian lotus in the True Immortal Realm, consuming it will not only greatly improve one's cultivation, but also transform one's physical body into a You Shui Xian body, making it ten times easier to comprehend the water attribute laws."

"That is the Tian Jin Drill! The legendary gold attribute treasure, using it to forge a Xian instrument can destroy anything!"

"I'm not mistaken, that blue bottle contains the Xuan Zhen Essence, so pure and numerous, enough for two people to advance to the Da Luo stage!"

"There's also that..."

Everyone stared at the items on the stone table, initially stunned, then suddenly chaotic, as those who recognized the items couldn't help but exclaim in shock.

Han Li glanced at the items on the stone table, a hint of fervor flashing in his eyes, but then he looked at the walls and floor around the table, his brow furrowed.

Jing Liu fixed his gaze on the You Shui Xian Lotus and the Tian Jin Drill, his eyes burning with desire, as he took a large step forward.

"Jing Dao friend, wait!" A figure suddenly appeared in front of him, blocking his path, it was Han Li.

"Stone Dao friend, what are you doing?" Jing Liu thought Han Li was trying to snatch the You Shui Xian Lotus from him, his face darkening as he shouted, his body ready to pounce.

"Take a look at the situation around the stone table." Han Li said calmly.

Jing Liu's expression changed as he looked around, his face pale.

The walls around the stone table were engraved with seven dark red patterns, each about a foot in size, with coarse lines and worn edges, revealing a hint of desolation.

The seven patterns depicted seven deities, but they didn't seem to be orthodox gods, instead, they were strange and eerie, with three heads and six arms, or human bodies with beast heads, exuding an aura of evil and ferocity, likely being evil gods.

The seven patterns were arranged in a specific order on the walls and floor, but the dark red patterns were quite faint, and the materials used for the walls were also reddish, making them hard to notice.

Others who had been eager to act also stopped, looking around, and soon discovered the patterns on the walls.

"It seems to be some kind of forbidden array." Wen Zhong examined the patterns carefully, muttering to himself.

The others looked at each other, unsure of what to do, seemingly not recognizing the array.

"I think it's better to try and see what happens, rather than making wild guesses." Jing Liu said, raising his hand.

"Jing Liu, don't be impulsive." Su Zhen Qian tried to stop Jing Liu, but it was too late.

A blue light shot out from Jing Liu's sleeve, heading towards the stone table.

As the blue light approached the table, the seven patterns suddenly burst into light, emitting a blood-red glow that condensed into a blood-colored screen.

At the same time, the screen rippled, and a massive head appeared, one of the seven evil god patterns, its mouth open wide, swallowing the blue light.

The evil god head devoured the blue light, but didn't immediately disappear, instead, it roared at Han Li and the others, as if trying to break free from the blood-colored screen's restraints and devour them.

A ferocious and violent intent erupted from the evil god head, transmitting into the minds of the onlookers!

Everyone's vision turned red, their minds filled with a vision of skulls piled high, blood flowing like rivers, and a desolate landscape, as an endless wave of killing intent assaulted their souls!

Fortunately, the cultivators present were extremely powerful, and their souls were strong, allowing them to quickly dispel the killing intent.

The evil god head roared again, but ultimately couldn't break free from the blood-colored screen's restraints, disappearing into the screen, which then flashed twice and vanished.

Han Li watched the scene unfold, his eyes flickering slightly.

Although he didn't recognize the blood-colored array, he had sensed some clues, the array seemed to be a blood path array, similar to the Qi Lian Kong's tears of blood array, but with more deadly variations.

As for how to break it, he was stumped.

"This is a formidable evil array, it seems we'll need to put in some effort to obtain the treasures inside." Lei Yu Ce muttered.

"Hmph! Who cares about the array? With so many of us working together, we can't fail to break it." Jing Liu sneered, his eyes fixed on the treasures on the stone table, filled with greed.

Jing Liu's method of breaking the array was crude, but the others nodded in agreement.

This method was the simplest, and they didn't have much time to waste.

Han Li's brow furrowed as he listened.

Although he hadn't seen through the blood-colored array, using brute force to break it might not work.

"If you want to obtain the treasures inside, it's best not to use brute force to break the array." A voice suddenly spoke up, it was Lan Yan, who had been silent until now.
The others were shocked by the words and looked at Lan Yan.

"Lan fellow, what do you mean by this? Do you recognize this array?" Lei Yu Ce's face lit up with excitement as he asked.

"I do, I've studied array formations and saw records of this array in an ancient book. This array is called the Seven Kill Blood God Array, a blood path array that contains the power of the seven evil gods. If you don't understand the method, using brute force to break it will cause the seven evil gods' power to collide and self-destruct. I don't know how powerful the explosion will be, but it will definitely destroy the treasures inside." Lan Yan said calmly.

Han Li's eyebrows rose, and a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes.

The others' expressions changed upon hearing this.

Jin Liu's face turned even darker, and he was about to make a rash decision.

It wasn't surprising, as the You Shui Xian Lian was extremely compatible with his cultivation method. If he could obtain it, he would have the confidence to break through his current bottleneck.

The Tian Jin Drilling was also something he had been searching for, and it had great use for him. Earlier, Han Li and the others had entered the golden gate first, where the golden attribute yuan qi was extremely dense, and it was possible that one or two Tian Jin Drilling could be cultivated.

He had suspected that Han Li had the treasure on him, and now he had encountered it here.

"Lan fellow, since you recognize this array, I suppose you also know the method to break it? Please, don't hesitate to teach us." Lei Yu Ce looked at Lan Yan and said sincerely.

"Lan fellow, you want me to help you for free?" Lan Yan smiled slightly and said.

"Lan fellow, do you want some compensation? Alright, after breaking the array, Lan fellow can choose one of the treasures as compensation, how about that?" Lei Yu Ce hesitated for a moment before saying.

The others also wanted the treasures inside, and upon hearing this, their expressions changed, but they didn't say anything.

"I can help you break the Seven Kill Blood God Array, but I don't want the treasures inside. Instead, I want to exchange for something else." Lan Yan said, then glanced at Han Li.

Han Li noticed Lan Yan's actions and his expression remained unchanged.

"Oh, Lan fellow, what do you want to exchange for?" Lei Yu Ce was stunned again and asked.

"I want Stone fellow to release my brother." Lan Yan looked at Han Li and said slowly.

"Your brother..." Lei Yu Ce's face moved, and the image of Lan Yuanzi appeared in his mind. He then looked at Han Li.

The others heard Lan Yan's words and also looked at Han Li.

Han Li immediately understood Lan Yan's intentions, using the opportunity to borrow the power of the group to force him to hand over Lan Yuanzi. It was a clever move.

He secretly sneered, but didn't speak, standing aside with his hands behind his back, feeling a bit strange. How did Lan Yan know that he hadn't killed Lan Yuanzi, but instead had imprisoned him?

"Stone fellow, is Lan fellow's brother in your hands?" Lei Yu Ce looked at Han Li and asked.

"Yes, Lan fellow and her brother teamed up against me, and I captured and imprisoned him." Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he said calmly.

Su Qian had guessed that Lan Yan and Han Li had a conflict earlier, and now that she heard Han Li's words, she thought to herself that it was indeed the case.

She then looked at Han Li and Lan Yan, her eyes darting back and forth, thinking of something.

Lei Yu Ce had guessed that there was a conflict between the three, but he didn't expect it to be so intense. He felt a bit heavy-hearted.

"Lei Yu Ce doesn't know what grudges you three have, but now that we're all in this together, we need to work together to progress. Stone fellow, can you release Lan fellow's brother?" He thought to himself, but his face was sincere as he spoke to Han Li, taking on a mediating tone.

"Lei fellow, I have a deep grudge against them, and I won't let it go. If I release his brother, they'll just attack me again." Han Li replied coldly.

"Lan fellow, what do you say?" Lei Yu Ce thought that Han Li's words had some reason to them, and he frowned, turning to Lan Yan.

"As long as Stone fellow releases my brother, I can swear that I won't attack Stone fellow in this secret realm, and Stone fellow's strength far surpasses mine and my brother's. We wouldn't dare do something so foolish." Lan Yan said immediately.

"Oaths are something that Stone doesn't believe in. Even if you swear with your heart demon, there are ways to break it. Stone won't put his safety in someone else's hands. This matter is not to be mentioned again." Han Li shook his head.

Although he had defeated Lan Yuanzi and Lan Yan earlier, he still felt that the Jiuyuan Guan's pursuit of him was not over. He had a sense of unease in his heart, which was why he had captured Lan Yuanzi instead of killing him.

With Lan Yuanzi as a trump card, Lan Yan would not dare to do anything to him, so why would he hand him over?

"Stone fellow, Lan fellow has said that she won't attack you, and you're still holding onto past grudges. As a man, you're being too petty. Furthermore, we're putting aside our grudges and working together, but you're going against what we said earlier." Jin Liu was eager to break the seal and, coupled with his dislike for Han Li, naturally sided with Lan Yan, putting pressure on Han Li.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and a hint of coldness flashed in his eyes.

He had saved Jin Liu earlier, but the other didn't show any gratitude. Instead, he was so selfish and ungrateful, which was truly despicable.
