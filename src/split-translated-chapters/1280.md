Han Li's sleeves fluttered, and another thirty-six bamboo bee cloud swords flew out, hovering in mid-air in front of the three of them, forming a row.

As Han Li pinched his fingers, the flying swords rotated and descended, releasing a massive wave of golden lightning that illuminated the surroundings, forming a thousand-meter-wide lightning sword screen that blocked the three of them.

At the same time, the Golden Boy's body flashed with golden light, transforming into a Devouring Golden Immortal, while Ti Hou lifted her hands, and her palms emitted a dark, eerie aura, summoning the Ghostly Claws and the Soul-Stealing Flute.

The three of them had just finished their preparations when a dense swarm of ghosts and spirits surged forward like a tidal wave.

These ghosts and spirits came in all shapes and sizes, with some being invisible, and their auras were vastly different. Most of the ghosts and spirits at the forefront were of the True Immortal realm or lower, but there were also Golden Immortal and Taiyi Immortal-level ghosts and spirits.

The sheer number of ghosts and spirits was astonishing, and their combined aura was terrifying.

The ghosts and spirits crashed into the lightning sword screen, unleashing various attacks that shook the screen.

Han Li's expression remained unchanged as he rapidly pinched his fingers, causing golden light points to appear on the screen, followed by countless lightning sword auras that shot out and struck the ghosts and spirits.

The sound of crackling and wailing filled the air as the ghosts and spirits were torn apart by the lightning sword auras.

The Heaven-Defying Lightning was extremely powerful, and its effect on the ghosts and spirits was particularly pronounced. The low-level ghosts and spirits at the forefront were instantly torn apart, disappearing into nothingness.

The subsequent ghosts and spirits, led by some higher-level ghosts, continued to surge forward without hesitation.

The ghosts and spirits seemed to be wary of the Black River, not daring to approach it, and instead attacked from the front and sides. This allowed Han Li and the others to focus on defending themselves without worrying about being attacked from behind.

However, the situation behind them was unclear, and it was uncertain whether retreating would trigger other restrictions or attract other powerful entities.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he continued to manipulate the lightning sword screen without speaking.

Although the lightning sword screen formed by the bamboo bee cloud swords was extremely powerful, the sheer number of ghosts and spirits was overwhelming. The screen began to show signs of fatigue as the ghosts and spirits continued to surge forward.

Ti Hou and the Golden Boy grew anxious, wanting to help Han Li, but he used his divine sense to restrain them, instructing them to conserve their strength.

Just then, a sharp whistle pierced the air, and the surrounding ghosts and spirits momentarily paused, condensing into four or five massive sword-shaped formations.

The formations rotated rapidly, like drill bits, before charging towards the golden sword screen.

The screen shattered with a loud "crack," and the thirty-six bamboo bee cloud swords reappeared, their lightning auras dimmed, as if their spiritual energy had been damaged.

Han Li's expression turned solemn as he raised his hand, collecting the swords and storing them within his body to nurture them. He then extended his fingers, grasping at the air.

The other thirty-six bamboo bee cloud swords guarding him suddenly shot out, transforming into thirty-six dazzling golden lights that struck the incoming ghosts and spirits.

The sound of explosions and screams filled the air as nearly a hundred ghosts and spirits were annihilated, but even more surged forward.

Ti Hou and the Golden Boy could no longer wait, and they joined the battle.

Ti Hou summoned the Ghostly Claws, which burst into flames, and the ghosts and spirits that came into contact with them were incinerated.

She also blew on the Soul-Stealing Flute, releasing black sound waves that transformed into countless sound blades, striking the surrounding ghosts and spirits.

Ti Hou used her Ghostly Claws and Soul-Stealing Flute to kill the ghosts and spirits, while her mouth emitted a dark aura that engulfed and devoured the surrounding ghosts and spirits.

In comparison, the Golden Boy's attacks were less effective.

It swung its front paws, unleashing dozens of cold, crystal-like lights that struck the ghosts and spirits on the right side, tearing them apart.

However, except for a few ghosts and spirits with physical bodies, the others were unaffected, reforming and continuing to attack.

The Golden Boy's eyes sank, and its massive body suddenly dissolved into a cloud of golden mist.

The other half of its body transformed into a smaller Devouring Golden Immortal.

The golden mist contained countless grain-sized Devouring Golden Insects that flew towards the ghosts and spirits, sticking to them and devouring them.

The ghosts and spirits were quickly consumed, but the speed was slower than expected, and the subsequent ghosts and spirits continued to surge forward.

Han Li's eyes gleamed as he rapidly fired his fingers, unleashing hundreds of lightning sword auras that struck the ghosts and spirits on the right side, annihilating nearly half of them and relieving the Golden Boy.

The three of them had managed to withstand the ghosts and spirits' assault, but the pressure was still immense, and the ghosts and spirits continued to gather from all directions, seemingly endless.

"Damn it, why are there so many ghosts and spirits? Master, what should we do now?" Ti Hou asked.

Han Li pondered for a moment before responding, "Rather than staying here as targets, let's take a risk and retreat along the Black River."

The three of them continued to fight as they retreated, flying rapidly upstream along the Black River.
"Look, there's a bridge ahead!" After a moment, Ti Hu suddenly exclaimed with excitement.

Han Li turned his head to look, and indeed, an ancient arched bridge appeared in front of them, stretching across the Black River.

The bridge was a dark red color, extending towards the other side of the Black River, disappearing into the darkness ahead, its length unclear.

The bridge was rugged and worn, damaged in many places, filled with the weight of years, but overall, it still seemed intact.

"Roar!"

Just then, the ghostly creatures suddenly went mad, frantically charging towards them with a ferocious attack, increasing the pressure on the three of them.

Han Li raised his hand, and a golden light shot out from his hand, landing on the stone bridge, transforming into a golden Dao soldier.

The Dao soldier sprinted along the stone bridge, flying forward.

The dark clouds in the sky didn't unleash any black lightning, and the terrifying snakes and insects in the river didn't attack.

"Retreat to the bridge!" Han Li saw this scene, his eyes lighting up, and immediately shouted.

As he spoke, a dazzling golden lightning burst forth from his arm, and then he swept his sleeve.

Rumbling sounds echoed out!

Hundreds of thick, golden lightning bolts swept across the surroundings, instantly clearing out the ghostly creatures within a radius of several dozen feet.

The three of them took advantage of the opportunity to rush onto the stone bridge. Ti Hu's face changed slightly, and her feet suddenly became weak, almost causing her to fall.

"Are you okay?" Han Li quickly supported her, directly pulling her forward.

The ghostly creatures gathered at one end of the stone bridge, letting out angry roars towards Han Li and the others, but they didn't dare to step onto the bridge.

"This bridge seems to have a power that suppresses ghostly creatures, and it also affects me slightly, but not much." Ti Hu took a deep breath, freeing herself from Han Li's support, and stood firm.

Han Li nodded, instructing her to be careful, and continued to walk forward quickly.

The stone bridge was arched, and as they walked further, they drew closer to the dark clouds in the sky. The three of them felt a sense of unease, but the dark clouds didn't react, as if the stone bridge had concealed their presence.

"Hmm?" Ti Hu exclaimed again.

"What's wrong?" Han Li and Jin Tong immediately became alert.

"There's something on the bridge ahead, it looks like a statue." Ti Hu's face revealed a strange expression.

"A statue?" Han Li was slightly surprised.

The three of them continued forward, soon arriving at the statue that Ti Hu had mentioned.

The statue was human-shaped, at least three or four feet tall, entirely gray and white, seemingly made of some special stone material, without emitting any aura.

The stone bridge was already narrow, and the statue stood in the middle, blocking most of the way.

"Why would something like this appear in a place like this?" Ti Hu examined the statue, saying.

Han Li's eyebrows also furrowed, using his Jiu You Mo Yan to carefully examine the gray and white statue.

"Cough... It's rare for a cultivator from the True Immortal Realm to dare to come to the Underworld Realm, truly rare." Just then, a muffled voice echoed out, surprisingly coming from the statue, speaking in the language of the True Immortal Realm.

The three of them were startled, quickly retreating a few steps.

"Who are you?" Han Li's eyebrows rose, asking.

"My name is probably unknown to you, but I'm also from the True Immortal Realm, just like you three. It's wonderful to meet fellow countrymen here." The statue's words were filled with an unmistakable joy.

"Are you truly from the True Immortal Realm?" Han Li listened to these words, his heart secretly shocked, but his face remained calm.

"I am from the Wutu Xian Domain, the Tu Huang Sect. I came to this Underworld Realm by chance. Speaking of which, what are you three people? What brings you to this Underworld Realm?" The statue asked.

Jin Tong's head suddenly lifted, his eyes flashing with a hint of intense, eerie light, but it quickly disappeared.

Jin Tong's expression changed for only an instant, but Han Li still caught sight of it.

"We three are just wandering cultivators, without a fixed residence. As for why we came here, it's similar to you – we were swallowed by a spatial rift and coincidentally arrived in this Underworld Realm." Han Li replied calmly.

"Originally, it was like that. Your luck is truly poor, ending up in the Ma Gui Huang Yuan. Fortunately, you managed to break out." The statue clicked its tongue, saying.

"It seems you know quite a bit about this Underworld Realm?" Han Li said.

"I wouldn't say I understand it, I've just mixed around here for a while." The statue chuckled.

"Why are you on this bridge, and why did you turn into a stone statue?" Han Li asked after a moment.

"Do you think I wanted to? I was sealed here by an enemy's secret technique." The statue sighed, saying.

Han Li wasn't surprised, having already used his Jiu You Mo Yan to detect the flow of spiritual energy within the stone statue, confirming that it was indeed a seal, a very high-level one.

However, he couldn't discern what was sealed within.
