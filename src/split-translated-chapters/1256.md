Han Li saw this and his heart was filled with joy.

The white air blades were formed by his powerful wind fingers, which did not contain any spiritual energy, making it difficult for the golden tentacles to defend against.

The other three people saw this and their faces showed surprise.

Jiao San quickly withdrew her gaze, and with a flick of her hand, a purple circular bead shot out from her sleeve.

The surface of the bead emitted a purple glow, and with a loud whooshing sound, it rapidly expanded, transforming into a grinding disc-sized object that struck the wall.

With a loud "plop" sound, the purple bead burst open, turning into a purple, glue-like substance that stuck to the wall, not falling off, and covering an area of several feet.

Jiao San's face turned solemn, and with a swift motion, she began to seal the purple liquid with a series of hand seals, causing it to squirm and emit purple light.

The golden light on the wall immediately disappeared, being absorbed by the purple liquid, which had a similar effect to the golden tentacles.

Han Li saw this and his heart stirred.

It was clear that this purple liquid also had the ability to absorb spiritual energy.

The purple liquid absorbed the spiritual energy on the wall, rapidly expanding and spreading in all directions, but the center of the wall remained exposed.

This exposed section of the wall no longer showed any signs of spiritual energy, and the originally golden wall had turned a pale purple, with several cracks appearing.

"This is the Poison Ancestor's Absorbing Yuan Poison Bead!" Pure Jun True Person exclaimed in shock from a distance.

"Haha, do you think we entered the Nine Yuan Palace without any preparations?" Lu Chuanfeng laughed loudly.

Yang Junzi and Lei Jun True Person's faces turned solemn, and they exchanged a glance before Yang Junzi's figure flashed towards Jiao San and the others.

"Don't move!" Lu Chuanfeng shouted, his body radiating a brilliant blue light, and with a swift motion, he swung his hands to the left and right.

A loud, muffled sound echoed, and a thick, massive blue ice wall suddenly appeared, dividing the hall into two sections.

The people from the Wheel of Rebirth Hall were on one side of the ice wall, while Pure Jun True Person, Yang Junzi, and Lei Jun True Person, as well as Chi Meng and Huo Yuan, were on the other side.

Lu Chuanfeng's face turned pale, and he seemed to have exhausted a large amount of his yuan energy.

Yang Junzi's momentum was unstoppable, and he crashed into the blue ice wall with a loud "boom" sound.

The blue ice wall didn't budge, and Yang Junzi's attack left no mark on it.

Pure Jun True Person and Lei Jun True Person quickly reacted, using their hand seals to activate the golden light within the hall, which enveloped the blue ice wall and began to absorb its spiritual energy.

However, the blue ice wall was not ordinary, and although its surface blue light began to dissipate, it did so slowly.

The ice wall contained a dense, unparalleled power of ice, making it impossible to penetrate, and the three people from the Nine Yuan Palace were trapped on the other side.

Shi Kongmo and Lu Chuanfeng didn't linger, turning to fly towards Jiao San and the others.

Jiao San continued to manipulate the purple liquid, and with a swift motion, she summoned a golden nail-shaped artifact that appeared in front of her.

The golden nail emitted a brilliant light, rapidly expanding to several feet in length and thickness.

"Go!" Jiao San shouted, and the golden nail shot out, striking the empty space within the purple liquid.

A soft "plop" sound echoed, and the nail sank into the wall, stopping halfway.

The palace was built with the same heavenly gold rock as the Nine Yuan Palace, making it impossible for the purple liquid to penetrate deeper than the surface.

Just then, Wu Yang's figure appeared behind the golden nail, and with a loud shout, he punched the nail's base.

Lu Chuanfeng flew over to replace Wu Yang, defending against the golden tentacles.

A loud explosion echoed, and the golden nail's light flashed wildly, sinking another half-foot into the wall, but still failing to penetrate it.

"How is this possible?" Wu Yang's eyes widened in shock.

"Move!" a voice shouted, and a powerful force sent Wu Yang flying.

Han Li's figure appeared behind the golden nail, his body radiating a brilliant starlight, and with a low growl, he unleashed a massive force that shook the surrounding air.

Chi Meng and Huo Yuan watched from a distance, their faces filled with surprise.

"This is... Han Li!" Chi Meng exclaimed, her expression changing.

Huo Yuan, however, remained calm, having seen this before.

Han Li ignored the others, his eyes fixed on the golden nail, and with a low growl, he concentrated his starlight onto his right hand, striking the nail with a powerful fist.

A brilliant starlight flashed, and Han Li's fist heavily struck the golden nail's base.
A loud boom echoed through the air!

The golden nail suddenly sank into the wall, piercing through it with a loud crash.

Han Li let out a loud shout, his other hand swiftly striking the tail of the golden nail.

A loud boom echoed through the air!

The golden nail was sent flying out of the wall, creating a large hole that was several people high.

However, Han Li was also sent flying back by the recoil force, stumbling backward several steps before regaining his footing.

...

At this moment, in a room deep within the Jiuyuan Palace.

The room was not large, and the interior was very simple, with only a few bamboo chairs and a bench, giving off a rustic feel, as if it was a bedroom.

A figure flashed into existence in the room.

The old man in gray robes was thin and frail, with a gaunt face and a slight hunchback, giving off the impression of a simple, elderly man.

The only unusual thing about him was his bright, piercing eyes, which seemed to gleam like an eagle's.

"Hmm, to think that he could break through the wall of the Mingjun Hall," the old man said, his eyebrows twitching with surprise.

"It's almost dark, and the commotion is getting out of hand..." He looked up at the sky, his voice calm and detached.

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man's figure flickered and disappeared into thin air.

...

 Inside the grand hall.

"Quickly, let's go!" 

Jiao San's eyes widened as he saw the wall being broken through, and he instantly transformed into a dark red light, shooting out of the hall, leaving behind the purple liquid on the wall.

Wu Yang, Lu Chuanfeng, and Shi Kongmo didn't dare to linger, and they quickly followed after him.

The black-clothed girl was standing a distance away from the hole, and she was about to follow Wu Yang and the others when she was suddenly surrounded by a flash of crystal chains, which were the divine chains of the mind.

Han Li stood a short distance away, his hands forming a seal as a crystal light appeared on his forehead, and the divine chains shot out from it.

"What are you doing?" the black-clothed girl shouted in anger.

Jiao San and the others saw this and their expressions changed, their bodies glowing with various colors as they tried to stop, but they were unable to do so.

"Wan'er, I'm sorry, I didn't know what happened to you, but I couldn't let you leave with these people!" Han Li said apologetically, before forming another seal.

Several divine chains shot out, entering the black-clothed girl's mind and forming a mental cage that trapped her spirit.

The black-clothed girl's eyes immediately became dull, and she stopped struggling.

Han Li saw this and was about to pull the black-clothed girl into the flower branch space.

But at this moment, a brilliant crystal light burst forth from the black-clothed girl's body, forming a surging wave of light that rapidly expanded in all directions.

The divine chains that had bound the black-clothed girl were instantly broken, and the mental cage in her mind was shattered.

Han Li's face changed as he saw this, and before he could react, the surging wave of light engulfed him.

A massive force overwhelmed him, and he was sent flying backward, his body like a leaf in the wind, as he spat out blood.

The black-clothed girl regained her freedom, and her expression returned to normal.

The crystal light on her body flashed and disappeared.

"Ru Xue, are you okay?" Jiao San and Wu Yang asked in concern, flying to her side.

But both of them couldn't help but look at her with surprise, as if they were astonished by what had just happened.

"I'm fine," the black-clothed girl said, shaking her head.

"Good, let's go!" Wu Yang said, pulling the black-clothed girl as they flew out of the hall.

Jiao San glanced at Han Li, who had been sent flying, and hesitated for a moment.

But he looked around at the golden tendrils that were flying towards them, and he quickly followed after Wu Yang and the others.

The Pure and True Immortal and the others were frantic, but they were blocked by the blue ice wall and couldn't stop them.

"You think you can just take something from the Jiuyuan Palace and leave?" a voice said, its tone slightly aged, but carrying an unspoken air of authority that echoed through the hall.

As the voice fell, a golden light appeared in the hall, expanding and filling the entire space, trapping everyone inside.

Jiao San, Wu Yang, Shi Kongmo, and even the Pure and True Immortal were all frozen in place, unable to move at all, like flies in amber.

Han Li was also trapped, his heart filled with shock.

He had been injured by the crystal light, but it wasn't too severe, and he quickly tried to use his time laws and physical strength to struggle free.

But the next moment, he felt a massive, unyielding force emanating from the golden light, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't move at all.

The others were the same, with only Shi Kongmo's black light flickering weakly, but even he couldn't move, his face showing a rare look of seriousness.
