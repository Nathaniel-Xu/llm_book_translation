Jin Tong stood up from the water pool, his expression solemn and heavy, and stood still for a moment before taking a step forward. His body glowed with a soft light, and a multitude of golden dots flashed briefly, evaporating the water vapor from his clothes.

Han Li's eyes swept over Jin Tong's body, and his heart felt a shock.

From Jin Tong's current aura, it was clear that his realm was still somewhat unstable, but he had already reached the middle stage of the Great Luo Realm.

What was even more astonishing was the aura emanating from Jin Tong's body, which was completely different from before, containing a complex and intense killing intent.

"It seems you have seen the past and the grudge between you and Xuan Yuan Jie," the Lord of the Reincarnation Hall said, his eyes fixed on Jin Tong.

Jin Tong's eyes snapped towards the Lord, his gaze as sharp as a knife.

"You know... my past?" Jin Tong's voice was low and husky, lacking the gentle tone of a girl.

"Jin Tong, how do you feel now?" Han Li asked.

"Call me Qu Lin," Jin Tong replied, his voice cold.

He paused, and his eyes seemed to soften. "I saw a vision... perhaps that was my past."

Han Li nodded, saying nothing.

"Qu Lin, the Dao Ancestor, was the ruler of the insect tribe, governing all the insect-like creatures in the True Immortal Realm. Later, due to a conflict with the Heavenly Court, she was suppressed by the Earth Dao Ancestor Xuan Yuan Jie, and her soul was destroyed. Using the last bit of her divine intention, she transformed into billions of bodies, attaching herself to the countless golden insects that had scattered throughout the True Immortal Realm, and even to the lower realms." The Lord of the Reincarnation Hall explained.

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise, and he had not expected Jin Tong to have such a past.

The others, including Zi Ling, also changed color.

"Xuan Yuan Jie... seems to be one of the 'Seven Lords of the Heavenly Dao'?" Shi Chuan Kong asked.

"That's right, he is one of the most loyal supporters of the Heavenly Dao. After defeating you, he ordered his subordinates to massacre the insect tribe, killing nine of the great insect kings and forcing the rest to flee to the lower realms... and eventually, they forgot their past and became the locusts that everyone hates." The Lord of the Reincarnation Hall said.

"Xuan Yuan Jie, I've remembered this debt, and I will definitely repay it," Jin Tong said, her fists clenched.

"Jin Tong... no, Qu Lin," Han Li said, his eyes flashing.

"Never mind, you can still call me Jin Tong. Even though I've recovered my memories, I'm not used to being called Qu Lin. I'll wait until I kill Xuan Yuan Jie before taking back my true name," Jin Tong said with a sigh.

"I have a question, why didn't Jin Tong's corpse disappear after advancing to the Great Luo Realm?" Shi Chuan Kong asked suddenly.

Everyone looked at each other, puzzled.

"She's different from ordinary cultivators. Firstly, she's a heavenly spirit insect, born with the essence of heaven and earth. Secondly, she's born with the law of devouring, and has always relied on devouring her own kind to increase her cultivation. Moreover, she's a Dao Ancestor's avatar, and doesn't need to kill her own body to advance. As long as she reunites the scattered golden insects, she can restore her Dao Ancestor's power." The Lord of the Reincarnation Hall explained.

"What's your plan now?" Han Li asked.

"Of course, I'll find my avatars and seek revenge against that person," Jin Tong replied without hesitation.

"Right," Han Li nodded.

He understood that Jin Tong was no longer the same as before.

"I won't be able to follow you anymore. The favors of the past, I'll repay them someday," Jin Tong said, her eyes flashing with hesitation.

"I have my own path to follow, and I'm glad we could accompany each other for a while. But in the future, when you're alone, take care of yourself," Han Li said, knowing that Jin Tong's departure was different from before.

Jin Tong nodded, and without saying anything, she turned and walked towards the upper layer of the great hall.

Han Li watched her leave, and didn't say anything to stop her. As her figure disappeared into the darkness of the underground palace, he slowly withdrew his gaze.

"Uncle, I'll come back and find you after I've recovered my strength and avenged myself!" Jin Tong's voice came from the darkness, already far away.

Han Li smiled, a hint of a smile on his lips.

"Why don't you keep her? A Great Luo Realm cultivator is a great asset," the Lord of the Reincarnation Hall asked.

"Why keep her? She'll come back after she's finished her business," Han Li replied.

The Lord of the Reincarnation Hall nodded, and without saying anything, turned and walked away, his voice fading into the distance.

"Things are done, you can leave now."

His words seemed to carry a hint of melancholy and relief.

Han Li and the others left the underground palace, and when they reached the outside, they saw that the blood clouds and the whirlwind above the Yellow Spring had disappeared.

"Let's go," Han Li said, looking back at the great hall.

Zi Ling and Shi Chuan Kong nodded, and were about to leave with Han Li, but Qi Hu remained in place, unmoving.
Han Li, I want to stay in the Underworld for a while. Ti Hun looked at Han Li and said.

Why is that? Han Li asked in puzzlement.

These past few days, following by your side, I've seen too many powerful beings, and I've come to realize that my strength is too weak. Continuing to stay by your side, I fear I won't be of assistance, but rather a burden. This Underworld is more suitable for my cultivation, and I wish to stay here to cultivate, hoping that one day my strength will increase, and I can return to your side. Ti Hun said solemnly.

Since we reunited in the Heavenly Realm, you've helped me more, what burden could you possibly be? However, for you, staying in the Underworld might indeed be better, I agree, and I hope that when we meet again, it won't be too far in the future. Han Li smiled and said.

Thank you, Master, for your understanding. Ti Hun bowed and said sincerely.

Han Li walked to Ti Hun's side, lifted his hand, and gently pressed it against her forehead, transmitting his voice: I'll leave a strand of divine sense in you, if you encounter any danger, activate the divine sense, and no matter where I am, I'll come to your side as quickly as possible.

Master, I didn't want to always be under your protection, that's why I wanted to be independent, how could I... Ti Hun transmitted her voice back, but before she could finish, Han Li interrupted her.

In times of life and death, don't be stubborn, as long as you have a chance, don't worry about not having a way out. Han Li smiled and said.

Ti Hun's heart slightly moved, and she nodded heavily.

Han Li brought Zi Ling and Shi Chuan Kong with him, and they bid farewell to Ti Hun, each going their separate ways.

...

Time passed, and several months had gone by.

The Black Wind Sea was in the midst of a clear morning, with no wind or waves on the surface, only a layer of white mist rising like smoke, enveloping the vast sea, making everything hazy and unclear.

In a place adjacent to this sea, separated by only a thousand yards or so, was a completely different scene.

There, dark clouds gathered, and massive black whirlwinds rose from the ground, with some as small as houses and others as large as ten thousand feet, looking like enormous dragon columns.

Inside the whirlwinds, the winds howled, and the waves crashed, with the sound of wailing and screaming constantly echoing.

At this moment, a spirit boat enveloped in a golden spiritual light suddenly parted the dark clouds and turbulent waves, slowly emerging from the massive black whirlwind columns.

On the spirit boat stood three figures, with the one in the front, steering the boat, being a handsome young man with white hair, and behind him stood a tall, green-robed young man and a beautiful, purple-robed woman.

This group of three was Han Li, Zi Ling, and Shi Chuan Kong, who had returned to the Heavenly Realm from the Underworld.

As they gazed out at the vast, misty sea, the three of them were deep in thought, silent and unspoken.

Just then, Han Li's eyebrows slightly twitched, and Zi Ling immediately noticed, transmitting a question:

Han Li, what's wrong?

We're surrounded, and there are many people, with the leader being at least a late-stage Mahayana cultivator. Han Li's expression remained unchanged as he transmitted the information to the two.

Zi Ling and Shi Chuan Kong were both seasoned veterans, and they naturally didn't reveal any unusual expressions.

What do we do? Shi Chuan Kong transmitted a question.

Don't rush, let's continue forward, and when the time is right, listen to my instructions. At that time, Shi Chuan Kong, you and Zi Ling will directly fly into the air, trying to break through the restrictions, and if you succeed, you'll leave, and if you can't... then try to get as far away from me as possible. Han Li transmitted his instructions.

Got it. Shi Chuan Kong responded decisively.

You, be careful. Zi Ling cautioned.

Shi Chuan Kong didn't even glance at her, and the spirit boat's light flashed, instantly disappearing into the distance, plunging into the vast mist.

Go! Han Li suddenly shouted.

Shi Chuan Kong and Zi Ling immediately abandoned the spirit boat, their bodies flashing as they flew into the air, heading towards the high skies.

In the next instant, the sea surface beneath them erupted into a frenzy of waves, and a massive, ten-thousand-yard-wide black shadow suddenly burst forth from the depths, like a mountain erupting from the sea, its aura overwhelming.

The shadow had been hiding beneath the surface for a long time, and now it burst forth, opening a massive, blood-red mouth, splitting the sea surface in two, and creating a gigantic, bottomless chasm.

Han Li's spirit boat, without anyone controlling it, was directly above the chasm, and it began to fall straight down.

Still a big fish... Han Li floated above the sea, gazing at the massive shadow, and exclaimed.

The massive black-scaled, dark-robed creature that burst forth from the sea was a colossal, black-scaled whale, its mouth filled with sharp, serrated teeth, and a massive, black whirlpool within, emitting a pungent, fishy smell.

On the whale's head, a black, spiral-shaped horn protruded, reflecting a metallic sheen.

A slender, white-robed young man stood on the whale's head, grasping the horn with one hand and holding a blue, long spear in the other, his mouth curled into a smile as he looked at Han Li.
