Han Li faced the scene before him, his brow furrowing slightly as he closed his eyes and calmed his mind.

A moment later, he suddenly opened his eyes and murmured, "The body's flesh, a false union, a body formed by chance, everything is without form."

With a "splat" sound, the surroundings shattered once more, returning to the black space.

Before he could rest, the scenery around him changed again, and new illusions appeared.

Various illusions swarmed in, each one directly targeting Han Li's heart.

He relied on his great determination and great willpower to cut through the illusions one by one, experiencing countless tests, although his mind grew firmer, his spirit was not invincible, and he was already exhausted to the point of collapse, his vision blurring.

He swung his heart sword, cutting through another illusion, and returned to the dark space, but did not escape.

At this moment, Han Li's spirit was dazed, and he was unable to continue fighting.

"A person's actions in the world, infinite calculations, thoughts arise from the heart, the heart is not calm, the thoughts are not clear. In your current state, you are unable to break through this barrier." A voice suddenly sounded, and it was the blue-robed Han Li.

"Infinite calculations..." Han Li's body swayed slightly, a hint of confusion flashing in his eyes.

"Give up, why must you struggle forward? Sometimes, letting go is the wise choice, just like that ancient cultivator, who gave up on the path of cultivation, and now lives a carefree life, put it down, put it down..." The blue-robed Han Li's voice turned gentle, echoing in his ears, tempting his heart.

Han Li's eyes grew increasingly dim, his consciousness slowly relaxing, as if an extremely tired person had found a soft bed, and was about to fall into a deep sleep.

Just as he was about to succumb, a spark of electricity flashed through his mind, and his remaining willpower suddenly awakened, suppressing his fatigue.

"Good technique, to strike when my spirit is most exhausted, if my mind was slightly less firm, I would have already failed, cut!" Han Li's eyes suddenly brightened, and he raised his hand, swinging it through the air.

With a "splat" sound, a formless sword sliced through the air, and the blue-robed Han Li's voice was cut off.

The black space around him shattered with a loud crash.

Han Li's vision blurred, and he found himself in the flower branch space.

"Finally..." he let out a long breath.

Just as he did, a loud "boom" sounded.

A vast and gentle power poured into Han Li's divine soul, sweeping away his exhaustion.

Not just his divine soul, Han Li felt that his entire body was extremely comfortable, as if he had finally achieved his goal after enduring countless hardships.

This sense of accomplishment, this great joy, was truly indescribable.

The power continued to flow into him, and Han Li's strength grew greater and greater, seemingly without end.

His body became light and airy, floating upwards, and he soon reached a very high place.

At this moment, it seemed as though the entire True Immortal Realm was beneath his feet, the Demon Realm, the Gray Realm, and the Nether Realm, all the same.

Han Li felt that he had transcended everything, becoming an all-powerful existence, his body continuing to float upwards, as if he was about to ascend to another world.

"Not good!" he suddenly woke up, suppressing the feeling of ascension.

Han Li's vision changed, and he found himself back in the flower branch space.

This time, the flower branch space was real.

"Originally, the final test was the attachment to power! How formidable, I almost sank into it. No wonder, cultivators like us have always pursued great power, even saints cannot escape!" Han Li thought, feeling a bit frightened.

However, his spirit was now perfect, without any gaps, and he raised his hand.

"Come out!"

A ball of blue light flew out of his body, merging with the Earthly Spirit's avatar that he had placed here earlier.

The flower branch space above suddenly turned golden, and the Heavenly Gate reappeared.

A loud crash sounded, and countless golden lights poured out of the gate, containing the mysteries of the Time Laws, and flowed into Han Li's body.

The heaven and earth energy within a radius of several tens of thousands of miles around Han Li's seclusion spot surged and gathered, and then flowed into his body along with the golden light from the Heavenly Gate.

Han Li's final divine orifice opened, and all 1800 divine orifices lit up.

His body radiated a dazzling golden light, forming a brilliant golden light ring that enveloped his body.

A series of powerful energy fluctuations emerged from the golden light, growing stronger and stronger.

Not just energy fluctuations, but also a series of powerful divine sense fluctuations emerged from the golden light, bursting out in all directions.

Han Li's cultivation had finally reached a breakthrough, and his Refining the Soul technique had reached the seventh layer, finally achieving perfection.

...

In the flower branch space, the Golden Child suddenly woke up, her body flashing and disappearing.

The next moment, her figure reappeared in the deepest part of the flower branch space, holding someone in her hand, who was none other than Nan Gong Wan.

A white light pillar shot out of the pavilion, soaring into the sky.

The light pillar emitted a series of powerful divine sense fluctuations, like a tidal wave.

The Golden Child's brow glowed with golden light, forming a golden crystal clear light screen that enveloped the two.

A series of powerful divine sense fluctuations swept in, and the golden light screen immediately fluctuated violently.

"Has husband successfully broken through?" Nan Gong Wan asked, her face filled with joy.

The Golden Child's eyes sparkled, and she replied, "This is indeed the case, but we must be careful, the fluctuations are too powerful, we must not let them affect us."
No, it seems that not only has his cultivation broken through, but his Refining Spirit Technique has also reached completion. Who would have thought that just the residual energy would be so powerful?" Jin Tong said, his hands moving swiftly as he maintained the light screen in front of him.

Outside the secluded area, the sky was filled with a brilliant, flashing golden light that engulfed everything.

Although the golden light was dazzling, it couldn't block a white light column from emerging from within. The column pierced through the void, disappearing without a trace.

In the Underworld's Wheel of Reincarnation Department, a white light column suddenly appeared in front of the Six Paths Wheel of Reincarnation, pouring into the wheel.

The Six Paths Wheel of Reincarnation began to shake violently, emitting a burst of dark energy. Within the energy, countless images seemed to be pouring into the white light column.

"What's going on?" A figure appeared in front of the Six Paths Wheel of Reincarnation. It was Gan Jiuzhen, who looked at the scene before him with a mixture of surprise and curiosity.

The white light column didn't last long, disappearing quickly into the void. The Six Paths Wheel of Reincarnation returned to its normal state.

"This situation is similar to what the Department Head once described as the seventh layer of the Refining Spirit Technique being completed. Who could it be? Could it be Han Li?" Gan Jiuzhen's eyes lit up, and he turned to leave, planning to contact the Department Head and report the incident.

...

Inside the Flower Petal Space, Jin Tong struggled to maintain the golden light screen in front of her.

Her spiritual energy was relatively weak, but the divine sense fluctuations emanating from Han Li's secluded area were growing stronger by the second. She was on the verge of collapsing.

Just as she was about to give up, the white light column inside the secluded area suddenly flashed and disappeared.

Jin Tong let out a sigh of relief, dispersing the light screen in front of her.

The white light column may have disappeared, but the golden light in the sky remained, pouring down in torrents.

Jin Tong felt the power of the Great Dao's laws within the golden light, and her eyes widened in shock.

When she had advanced to the Dao Ancestor stage, she had received the blessing of the Heavenly Dao, but compared to Han Li's current state, she was far inferior.

Han Li's strength would likely reach unprecedented heights after this breakthrough.

Time passed slowly, and after a long while, the golden light in the sky finally dissipated.

Inside the secluded area, the golden light on Han Li's body also gradually faded, revealing his true form.

He slowly opened his eyes, his gaze cold and emotionless, as if he had become a manifestation of the Heavenly Dao.

A mighty aura burst forth from his body, crushing everything in its vicinity, reducing it to nothingness.

The Earth Spirit's manifestation revealed a terrified expression, as golden light surged around his body, forming a golden light sphere that enveloped him.

The aura reached him, and the golden light sphere began to violently fluctuate, shattering and disappearing in an instant.

The secluded area was reduced to nothingness, and the entire structure disappeared into thin air.

The massive aura continued to spread, destroying everything in its path, leaving behind a trail of nothingness. The Flower Petal Space was on the verge of collapse, with cracks spreading throughout its surface.

"Han Li!" Jin Tong's face changed, and she cried out in alarm, her body glowing with golden light as she poured her energy into the Flower Petal Space to stabilize it.

Han Li's body shook, and his eyes regained their vitality, no longer empty.

He looked at the state of the Flower Petal Space and moved his mind, causing the aura to dissipate and slowly recede.

Jin Tong let out a sigh of relief, dispersing the golden light around her.

The Earth Spirit's manifestation reappeared, its golden light sphere disappearing.

"I didn't expect you to discard your attachments so quickly, cutting off your sense of self. I... lost." The Earth Spirit looked at Han Li, a hint of a sigh in its voice.

"As you said, thoughts arise from the heart, and the heart must be calm for thoughts to be clear. I am not myself, I have no self, no attachments, no thoughts. If thoughts do not exist, then I am free from all phenomena." Han Li looked at the Earth Spirit, his eyes flickering with a hint of movement, his voice calm.

Unlike the Evil Corpse and the Benevolent Corpse, the Self Corpse before him was something he couldn't fully comprehend, despite having successfully severed it.

"What do you plan to do with me? I was born from you, and you can't completely eliminate me." The Earth Spirit asked.

"You are far more unpredictable than the Evil Corpse and the Benevolent Corpse. Leaving you by my side would be too great a risk. I'm sorry, I won't take that chance." Han Li's voice was detached. "You're not even comparable to the current me."

The Earth Spirit shook its head, laughing wryly.

Han Li didn't respond, instead flipping his hand.

The Palm Heaven Bottle appeared in his hand, and he activated it, causing the bottle to expand and spin rapidly.

A dark green light shot out of the bottle, piercing the void.

The void split open, revealing a crystal wall.

Han Li activated the crystal wall, and a vortex appeared, filled with flashing lights of various colors.

"A time-space tunnel? You want to exile me to the turbulent flow of time and space? That's perfect." The Earth Spirit's eyes gleamed.

"I won't tolerate any mistakes in what I plan to do next. You can go in peace." Han Li waved his hand, and a golden light enveloped the Earth Spirit, sending it into the crystal wall's vortex.

The Earth Spirit didn't resist, disappearing into the vortex without a sound.

Han Li waved his hand, and the crystal wall disappeared, the Palm Heaven Bottle returning to its original size and falling into his hand. He looked up, his gaze fixed on the void ahead.

Nan Gong Wan and Jin Tong flew over, landing in front of Han Li.

"Sorry, I made you worry." Han Li smiled.

"No need to apologize, as long as you're successful." Nan Gong Wan shook her head.

"Han Li, what's our next move?" Jin Tong asked.

Han Li didn't respond, his gaze fixed on the void above.
