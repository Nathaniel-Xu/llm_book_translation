E Ji's hand flashed with a black light, and a long, heavy black sword suddenly appeared in his hand. The sword was not straight, but slightly curved, resembling a black dragon. Its body gave off a ferocious aura.

The sword body had many white patterns etched into it, forming a star map. The star map had over 200 sparkling stellar lights.

"Barbarian Dragon Sword!" Sha Xin's face darkened, his ten fingers turned into residual shadows, and four puppets turned into four golden shadows, flying towards E Ji.

E Ji's arm moved, and the massive black sword in his hand became a black sword aura, chopping towards the five puppets.

The two began to fight fiercely, with continuous explosions, like thunder booms.

The blood lake nearby churned up massive waves, and the entire cave shook.

E Ji's power was fully unleashed, with over a thousand spiritual acupoint lights opening, growing stronger as he fought. His Barbarian Dragon Sword was incredibly powerful.

Sha Xin, on the other hand, seemed to have weakened after being injured, his control over the puppets decreased, unlike their swift and agile movements in the Bloody Hall.

However, E Ji was still entangled by them, unable to get close to the crystal coffin.

Han Li stood next to the crystal coffin in the center of the lake, watching the intense fight between Sha Xin and E Ji. His pupils constricted.

Although Han Li's power had increased greatly, the battle between Sha Xin and E Ji made him feel their immense gap.

"You, human dog thief, return my heart!" A shout of anger echoed, as Shi Zhanfeng flew towards Han Li with bloodshot eyes.

His gaping chest wound had healed, and his arm had developed dark, cruel-looking patterns, emitting an icy and violent aura.

Han Li looked at the dark patterns, his eyebrows twitching.

Shi Zhanfeng's speed had increased by nearly half, his movements swift and deadly. In an instant, he arrived in front of Han Li, a massive fist pounding downwards.

A sound of "Shira" echoed, as a massive amount of dark energy exploded from his palm, transforming into a gigantic black fist that descended onto Han Li.

Han Li swung his own fist, countering the black fist. The air shook violently.

The black fist disintegrated, Shi Zhanfeng's face turned red, stumbling backwards. Han Li's body shook greatly, retreating three steps as his eyes flashed with an unusual color.

The power within the black fist was extraordinary, far surpassing Shi Zhanfeng's previous display of strength. A sharp, cold power coursed through Han Li's body, threatening to break through his defenses.

Just as this happened, two puppets materialized above Shi Zhanfeng.

The winged puppet flapped its four wings, unleashing dozens of white, feather-like blades that shot towards Shi Zhanfeng.

The other puppet's mouth opened wide, releasing nearly a dozen silver branch-like protrusions that emitted silver lightning, striking Shi Zhanfeng.

Shi Zhanfeng's lips curved into a mocking smile, as his body was enveloped in a black crystal membrane, safeguarding him.

The blades and lightning struck Shi Zhanfeng, but they were like gnats shaking a tree, disintegrating immediately, while Shi Zhanfeng's black membrane remained undamaged.

Shi Zhanfeng coldly snickered, extending a lightning-fast hand.

His arm's black energy expanded, transforming into a colossal, door-sized blade of dark energy that radiated pale light, slicing towards the puppets.

Xiao Zi's eyes widened in shock, about to order her puppets to retreat, but it was too late.

The black blade sliced into the puppets, dissecting them with ease.

"What?!" Xiao Zi's expression transformed in shock.

Han Li watched this unfold, an awed look in his eyes.

Sha Xin, still battling E Ji, glanced over and shouted: "Xiao Zi, don't bother with Shi Zhanfeng! The heart is what matters, we cannot let it fall into his hands!"

Xiao Zi's gaze flicked to Han Li, then she wavered for a moment before taking no action.

Sha Xin's eyes darkened, as she began to chant.

Xiao Zi's forehead showed a golden pattern, her eyes turning emotionless. She swiftly waved her hands.

Two golden orbs flew out of her palms, flashing golden light before expanding into two massive, golden human puppets.

The puppets were clad in golden armor, one hand holding a golden shield etched with turtle shell patterns, the other grasping a massive golden sword.

Their presence radiated incredible auras, surpassing the feathered and beast-bodied puppets, even rivaling Sha Xin's four element puppets.

"Miss Xiao Zi, I have no intention of taking the heart, nor do I wish to be your enemy! Please refrain from this!" Han Li beseeched.

Xiao Zi ignored him, ordering her puppets to action.

The two golden puppets stomped the ground, created massive shockwaves, and transformed into golden light, charging towards Han Li.

Their massive swords morphed into two blinding gold arcs, descending onto Han Li.

The sword struck before the light, a dual whirlwind of sword energy roared, piercing Han Li's skin.
Han Li furrowed his brow, took a step to the side, and dodged the two incoming swords. 

However, these two puppets were extraordinary, turning quickly to pursue Han Li, not losing a step. The large swords in their hands crisscrossed, striking downwards from left and right.

The two puppets also used their shields as weapons, smashing them towards Han Li, almost completely cutting off his surroundings.

At this moment, a cold laugh came from the side, and Shi Zhanfeng pounced once again. 

He swung his hand once more, and a dense black light burst forth from his palm, transforming into a huge, black beast claw in mid-air. It seemed to be cast from iron and dropped towards Han Li, cutting off his only escape route.

Han Li's expression turned cold as he rapidly moved his heart into his chest, his body spinning swiftly. At the same time, a white glow enveloped his fists, which he then thrust out in all directions, creating a burst of white fist shadows.

Countless white fist shadows exploded like a peacock's open plumage, shooting towards the surroundings and producing ear-piercing whistles.

A series of loud booms erupted.

The two human-shaped puppets were each struck by dozens of fist shadows, their bodies quivering like sieves as they flew backwards.

The black beast claw above was also shattered by the white fist shadows, exploding apart.

However, Han Li's body was also severely shaken, his face pale as he took a step back.

At that very moment, Shi Zhanfeng's figure appeared behind him, his speed increased even further.

His body was enveloped by a layer of fast-moving black air, producing a faint, ear-piercing whistle. In his hand was a pitch-black war knife, transformed into a black streak that slashed towards Han Li's neck.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and his body suddenly dived forward, but his feet remained firmly rooted on the ground.

The black streak of light passed over his head, missing its mark.

Shi Zhanfeng didn't expect this, and his face changed color as he prepared to retreat.

However, Han Li's body was like a spring, rapidly becoming tense as he stood up. With a swift motion, he closed in on Shi Zhanfeng and hurled his elbow, its shadow appearing as he struck.

Shi Zhanfeng saw that he couldn't dodge in time, so he let out a loud shout, swinging his elbow to strike back. A dark pattern on his arm glowed brightly, faintly revealing the shape of a beast's claw, which collided with Han Li's elbow.

A crackling sound came from Shi Zhanfeng's left arm, his bones snapping. His body was sent flying backwards, a flicker of shock crossing his eyes.

However, he twisted his body in mid-air, heading towards the two human-shaped puppets in the distance.

The two puppets had already regained their footing, ignoring the approaching Shi Zhanfeng. With a powerful kick, they pounced towards Han Li once more, the large swords in their hands shining brighter, transforming into two golden sword qi that chopped downwards.

Han Li had initially wanted to chase after Shi Zhanfeng but was intercepted by the two puppets, forcing him to counterattack. He let out a deep breath and thrust out two fists.

Two large, white fist shadows shot out, crashing into the golden sword qi and producing a series of loud explosions.

The golden sword qi was easily dispersed, and the two puppets raised their shields to protect themselves.

Two loud clanging sounds rang out.

The fist shadows shattered, and the surface of the shields also flashed with golden light.

The puppets' bodies shook violently, taking a step back simultaneously.

At that moment, a golden light flashed between the two puppets, shooting towards Han Li's chest like lightning - a golden lance.

The one wielding the lance was none other than "Xiao Zi", who was now wearing a golden, tight-fitting battle armor that accentuated her curves. On the armor was inscribed a golden Peng bird pattern.

This pattern was incredibly lifelike, with every line radiating a dazzling golden light, appearing extraordinary.

Han Li's gaze shifted slightly, his hands joining together with a slapping sound as he grasped the tip of the golden lance, bringing it to a stop.

Xiao Zi let out a shout, and her golden armor suddenly burst forth with dazzling golden light, displaying over fifty Star Orbs that floated to the surface. Her body lifted off the ground, and a powerful force flowed into her through the armor.

With a fierce cry, she pulled on the lance with all her might, but the lance tip seemed to be held in place by an invisible force, refusing to budge.

"Miss Xiao Zi, do you truly have no impression of me?" Han Li gazed into Xiao Zi's eyes, transmitting his voice.

Xiao Zi's eyes remained expressionless, ignoring Han Li's words. The golden light on her armor intensified, and a bloody glow appeared on her face, as if she were preparing to unleash a powerful technique.

Han Li's eyes dimmed slightly as he sighed inwardly, his hands advancing to push Xiao Zi. She flew backwards, lance still in hand.

At that moment, a figure appeared behind Xiao Zi, Shi Zhanfeng's silhouette flashing into existence. A ferocious smile spread across his face as he transformed his black war knife into a black streak, chopping downwards towards Xiao Zi's head.

The black light on the knife danced, momentarily revealing the silhouette of a black, ancient beast. The black knife suddenly became over ten times heavier, and the air in front of it split apart with a ripping sound, creating a perfectly linear tear in space.

Xiao Zi was caught off guard, her body still flying backwards, and she was powerless to avoid the incoming knife.
