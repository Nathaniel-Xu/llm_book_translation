The golden ancient sword let out a clear hum, and then was easily pulled out by Xiong Shan's right arm. 

Xiong Shan held the golden ancient sword in his hand, his broken body swaying slightly, but he finally steadied himself, a faint, sinister smile playing on his lips.

As the golden ancient sword and the golden flames left the altar's top, the golden light flashing on the altar's surface suddenly dimmed, and the flames that filled the air also disappeared.

At this moment, Hu San and Jiao San, as well as Lei Yu Ce, appeared.

Hu San and Jiao San's white light shields were gone, clearly destroyed.

The two were now covered in a dark red halo, their clothes tattered, their bodies covered in bloodstains.

Lei Yu Ce's situation was much better, the golden light arrays around him undamaged, but the golden sword shadows within were cut off.

Lei Yu Ce and Wen Zhong's faces were pale, their energy depleted.

But when they saw the golden flames fall into Han Li's hands, and the ancient sword pulled out by Xiong Shan, their faces turned even paler.

Just as they were about to say something, a muffled sound came from within the golden altar, as if something had shattered.

Han Li heard the sound, and a sense of unease rose up within him.

Before he could react, a loud roar came from within the altar, as if countless people were shouting towards the sky, filled with endless cheers.

As the roar grew louder, blinding black light burst forth from the altar's crack, causing the entire cave to shake violently, as if the earth was splitting apart.

The golden altar also shook violently, other cracks opening up, releasing bursts of black light.

"Brother Han, Brother Xiong, quickly put back what's in your hands! Quickly!" Lei Yu Ce's face was deathly pale, his voice trembling.

Han Li saw the scene before him, his heart already filled with shock, and he hesitated.

Xiong Shan, however, seemed to ignore Lei Yu Ce's words, holding the golden ancient sword in his arms, and taking out a blood-red pill to swallow.

Han Li looked at the golden flames in his hand, gritted his teeth, and was about to put them back.

Just then, a thunderous explosion shook the air, and the golden altar burst open, shattering into countless pieces.

Xiong Shan, who was standing on the altar, was blown away by the explosion, flying towards Han Li.

Xiong Shan's state was extremely bad, and he seemed unable to even fly, his body blown away by the explosion, but his right hand still tightly grasped the golden ancient sword.

Han Li saw this, and with a wave of his hand, released a burst of blue light, catching Xiong Shan and preventing him from crashing into the wall.

"Th...thank you..."

Xiong Shan thanked Han Li, but his expression was not grateful, and instead seemed wary, holding the golden ancient sword tightly in his arms, as if afraid Han Li would take it away.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, feeling that Xiong Shan's behavior was a bit abnormal, and different from his usual self, but he didn't say anything, and turned to look at the altar.

A black light portal appeared within the shattered altar, releasing large amounts of black light.

The portal flashed several times, then shattered, and a loud roar erupted.

Figures flew out of the shattered altar, their numbers reaching over a hundred, floating in mid-air, their voices filled with excitement.

"Ha ha! I've finally come out! Come out!"

"How many tens of thousands of years, I've finally escaped this bitter sea!"

"Where is Wen Taixu? I, Pan Qian Luo, vow to rip his belly open and dig out his heart, or else I'll never be able to vent my billion-year-old hatred!"

These figures were mostly human, some half-human, half-beast, or simply beast-like, with black energy swirling around them, clearly demonic in nature.

Han Li's expression changed, his eyes flashing, and he quickly retreated, flying towards the cave wall to avoid being surrounded.

These demonic figures were not weak, most of them at the Tai Yi level, and some of them even stronger than Han Li.

Xiong Shan, who had recovered some of his energy, also retreated, standing near Han Li.

A layer of blood light appeared on his body, and his wounds began to heal rapidly, his broken limbs regrowing.

In an instant, Xiong Shan's body had recovered, although his face was still pale.
At this moment, Lei Yu Ce and the others also hastily retreated, Lei Yu Ce and the three of them stood together, while Huo San and Jiao San happened to be standing beside the Lan siblings, and they also stood together, their expressions extremely solemn, and they glared fiercely at Han Li and Xiong Shan.

The group of demon tribe people had finished venting their excitement and looked at Han Li and the others, their faces twisted into cruel smiles.

"Hehe, were you few the ones who broke the seal?" A tall and robust man with a strong physique stepped forward, looking at Han Li and the others.

This person's skin was a dark bronze color, and his cheeks and chin were covered in thick, lion-like whiskers. His hair was upright like iron needles, and his muscles were extremely powerful, making him look like a majestic lion king, gazing down at the surroundings.

Han Li and the others were swept by his gaze, and their hearts trembled.

"Not bad, we are from the Golden Origin Realm, and we accidentally came here. I don't know what kind of people you are, and why you are here?" Han Li's eyes moved, and he cupped his hands, saying.

"Is that so? Then thank you very much. As a reward, I will allow you to become our blood food, and hand over your essence and soul!" The long-whiskered robust man's eyes flashed with two eerie lights, and his mouth curled into a cruel smile.

His voice had not fallen when he suddenly stretched his body, transforming into a long snake-like illusion, and instantly pounced on Han Li, his two fists, which were as big as basins, radiating a strong black light, and heavily striking down.

The long-whiskered robust man seemed to be very familiar with the fighting habits of human cultivators, his physical body was extremely strong, and his speed was also extremely fast. Moreover, this place had a limited space, and a close-range attack was more effective than any divine artifact or secret technique.

Unfortunately, the long-whiskered robust man had miscalculated this time. Facing his sudden attack, Han Li's expression was cold and indifferent, and his body flickered, disappearing from the original place, and reappearing about 70-80 meters away.

The long-whiskered robust man was stunned, and he stood still in place.

At this moment, a sudden whistling sound erupted, like a thunderclap, and a golden sword light, about 50-60 meters long, descended from the sky, like a swift sword, striking towards the long-whiskered robust man.

The golden sword light, as it passed through the air, left a neat black line, and the cold and fierce sword intent covered the entire cave space.

The long-whiskered robust man's expression changed, and he grabbed at the air with his right hand, and a black large hammer appeared in his hand.

He shook his arm, and the black large hammer let out a loud sound, transforming into a ball of black, heavy light, and striking towards the golden sword light.

The long-whiskered robust man's black hammer was not an ordinary magical artifact. When he had first started cultivating, he had traveled through the demon realm and encountered a mountain peak formed from dark iron. He had spent a great deal of effort to move it to a place with a underground fire vein.

He had used the power of the underground fire vein to smelt the mountain, and after 100,000 years, he had finally refined the dark iron, removing all the impurities, and turning it into a pure dark iron.

The long-whiskered robust man had later collected hundreds of top-grade golden attribute minerals from the demon realm, and fused them into the dark iron, and then used the demon tribe's secret technique to refine and forge it for tens of thousands of years, finally creating this dark iron hammer.

This hammer seemed ordinary, but it was extremely heavy, and even a cultivator at the Taiyi Realm could not lift it.

The long-whiskered robust man himself was extremely powerful, and his hammer strike was unmatched, capable of crushing any attack.

The sword light and the black hammer collided, and with a slight sound, the black hammer split in two, the cut surface smooth and neat.

The golden sword light easily cut through the black hammer, and then continued to strike towards the long-whiskered robust man without stopping.

The long-whiskered robust man's expression changed greatly, and he spat out a black orb.

The black light burst forth, and with a loud sound, it shattered, transforming into a black light sphere, about 10-20 meters in size, which engulfed the long-whiskered robust man's body.

The golden sword light struck the black light sphere, and with a cracking sound, the black light sphere was cut in two, and the two halves were crushed by the golden sword light's cold and fierce sword intent, and turned into countless black light points that dispersed, but the long-whiskered robust man's body was nowhere to be seen.

The golden sword light flashed and disappeared, transforming into a person, who was Xiong Shan, still holding the golden ancient sword.

His face was still pale, but his expression was filled with excitement, and he was looking at the ancient sword with an unbridled enthusiasm, his eyes shining with an uncontainable excitement and fervor.

It seemed that in his eyes, only this sword was the most important thing, and for this sword, he could disregard everything, even if it meant falling.

In the distance, about 1,000 meters away, the black light flickered, and the long-whiskered robust man's body appeared.

He was still pale, and seemed to have been injured by the sword strike, but he did not care about it, and looked at the broken black hammer, a hint of pain flashing across his face.

The dark iron hammer had been destroyed, and it could no longer be used. Fortunately, the materials had not been completely destroyed, and they could be re-refined, but it would take many years.

"Great Wilderness Ancient Sword!" The long-whiskered robust man turned his head, looking at Xiong Shan's ancient sword, and spoke in a cold voice, his tone filled with a sense of dread.

And Xiong Shan's sword had easily destroyed the long-whiskered robust man's black hammer, and his evaluation of the ancient sword had risen to another level, making him even more proud and arrogant.

"Haha, demon tribe thieves, you have bitten the hand that feeds you, look at my sword!" He shouted loudly, and the Great Wilderness Ancient Sword radiated a dazzling light, enveloping his body.

The golden light flashed, and Xiong Shan and the Great Wilderness Ancient Sword disappeared, transforming into a 100-meter-long golden sword light, which struck towards the long-whiskered robust man once again.

The sword light was like a long rainbow, and it emitted a thunderous sound, like the sound of countless horses galloping, and it was unstoppable!
