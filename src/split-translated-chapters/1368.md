The atmosphere in the hall was heavy with tension as Guo Jin heard the words, a flicker of surprise flashing across his face before he quickly regained his composure and remained silent.

The crowd in the hall erupted into a commotion once again, as they couldn't fathom why Guo Jin hadn't retorted.

"Lü Huan, you just mentioned the Three Thousand Dao God Array, what kind of array is that?" a voice asked, belonging to the red-robed old man, Zhen Shi Yin, who stood beside the Cang Wu True Lord.

The crowd's eyes immediately turned to Zhen Shi Yin, who dared to speak out against the Lü Huan.

The Cang Wu True Lord and the Feng surname Dao Ancestor exchanged a glance, their eyes flashing with surprise.

"It's an array that can destroy the heavens and the earth, yet also open the heavens and create a new world," Lü Huan explained slowly, his eyes fixed on Zhen Shi Yin.

"Destroy the heavens and the earth? Open the heavens and create a new world? Lü Huan, can you explain it more clearly?" Zhen Shi Yin asked, his brow furrowed in confusion.

"If I'm not mistaken, the Three Thousand Dao God Array is an array that can simultaneously operate the three thousand laws of the world, an array that can recreate the primordial chaos, destroying everything in the world and allowing it to return to its original state. The person who activates the array can, with the power of the array, break free from the constraints of the heavens and control the source of all laws, the primordial chaos, and become an existence beyond the heavens, creating a new world and becoming its master," Lü Huan continued.

The hall fell silent, the only sound being the quiet breathing of the crowd, as they listened to Lü Huan's words in shock.

The White Cloud Dao Ancestor and the other Dao Ancestors of the Heavenly Court were also shocked, but they quickly regained their composure.

Guo Jin's expression remained calm and unruffled.

Zhen Shi Yin's face changed, and he took a while to calm down.

However, he suddenly jolted, as if remembering something, and turned to Guo Jin, asking, "Your Excellency, you and Lü Huan mentioned wanting to break through the heavens, could it be that you're planning to use the Three Thousand Dao God Array?"

The crowd turned to look at Guo Jin, their faces filled with curiosity.

Most of them were cultivators from the various immortal realms, who had come to attend the Bodhi Banquet.

"There's only one way to break through the heavens, and that's by using the Three Thousand Dao God Array," Lü Huan said, before Guo Jin could respond.

"Is what you said true?" Guo Jin didn't respond, but Zhen Shi Yin's eyes locked onto Lü Huan, asking again.

"To activate the Three Thousand Dao God Array, two conditions must be met. The first is that a massive amount of yuan qi is required, which is why the Heavenly Court has been frantically searching for spiritual materials from the various immortal realms," Lü Huan explained.

"What's the second condition?" Zhen Shi Yin asked, his eyes narrowing.

"Of course, it's necessary to gather as many of the three thousand great dao as possible. The Heavenly Court has been secretly working on this, and the prisoners captured by the Xianyu will eventually... I'm sure everyone knows what will happen to them. Furthermore, the Heavenly Court has never stopped collecting treasures that contain special laws, and the purpose of this is obvious," Lü Huan continued.

The crowd's expressions changed, and they slowly became calm, seemingly believing Lü Huan's words, their gazes at the Heavenly Court cultivators filled with a mix of emotions.

"This is utter nonsense! What Three Thousand Dao God Array, destroying the heavens and the earth? It's all just empty words! The Heavenly Court extracts the prisoners' laws, one reason is to punish them, the other is to use those laws to refine some immortal artifacts. As for the materials containing special laws, they're just used to refine some special treasures to defend against the Lü Huan. Fellow cultivators, this is just Lü Huan's scheme to divide us, don't be deceived!" the White Cloud Dao Ancestor exclaimed, seeing the situation was not in their favor.

"Yes, Lü Huan has always been secretly stirring up trouble, causing chaos in the various regions, and now he's come to deceive us with his words!" the dwarf old man and the others chimed in.

"White Cloud Dao Ancestor, I've long suspected why the Heavenly Court is extracting the prisoners' laws, and I've secretly investigated. From what I know, those extracted laws aren't being sent to the Heavenly Court's Hundred Refinements Peak to refine immortal artifacts, but are being sent somewhere else," Zhen Shi Yin said.

The White Cloud Dao Ancestor turned to him, a cold glint in his eyes.

"White Cloud Dao Ancestor, the situation has come to this, and I'm afraid I can no longer believe in the Heavenly Court. I, Zhen Shi Yin, have no intention of getting involved in your internal conflicts, you can do as you please," Zhen Shi Yin said, bowing slightly towards the Heavenly Court cultivators, before turning to leave.

The crowd watched as Zhen Shi Yin flew out of the hall, and soon, others followed him, leaving the hall.

The Cang Wu True Lord and the Feng surname Dao Ancestor exchanged a glance, before they too flew out of the hall.

In the blink of an eye, more than half of the cultivators had left the hall.

The remaining people were sparse, less than a third of the original number.

"You...!" the White Cloud Dao Ancestor's face turned red with anger, but he didn't dare to stop the others from leaving, as he couldn't read Guo Jin's expression.

Chen Ruyan's eyes flashed, but she didn't leave.

The Yin Ming Dao Ancestor also didn't leave, standing still, blocking the demonic army.

The number of cultivators in the hall was originally small, and now that more than half had left, the difference between them and the demonic army was even more pronounced.

"Hehe, Lü Huan, you're impressive. With just a few words, you've managed to divide the enemy's forces," the demonic lord said, transmitting his voice to Lü Huan.

"Lü Huan, you're being too modest. It's just that Guo Jin has been acting against the natural order, losing the support of the people, and that's why my words had any effect," Lü Huan replied, transmitting his voice back.
"Mansion Master, the rest will be handled by us." The Demon Master transmitted his voice, then raised his hand and waved it forward.

Rumbling sounds echoed through the air as the Demon Domain's army advanced, their footsteps synchronized and shaking the heavens.

The barbarian domain's army also moved forward, shrinking the encirclement.

As the massive footsteps reverberated, an endless tide of pressure surged forth from the army, pressing towards the Heavenly Court's people within the Jade Pool.

...

As Han Li's palm emitted a burst of lightning, a loud "sizzling" sound erupted, and wisps of cyan smoke instantly burst forth from the top of Meng Yuan's skull and his seven apertures.

Regardless of Meng Yuan's final curse, whether it was an angry imprecation or a mystical incantation, Han Li had no interest in listening to it.

A moment later, Meng Yuan's aura completely dissipated, and Zishan and Dongli Hu exchanged a glance, their expressions growing increasingly solemn.

Han Li lifted the head that had been blasted by the Divine Lightning, still somewhat uneasy, and a silver glow flashed across his palm. A small silver flame figure suddenly darted into the skull.

"You can have your whole corpse back..." Han Li casually tossed the head back onto Meng Yuan's corpse.

A loud "whoosh" sound erupted, and the corpse immediately ignited with a fierce silver flame.

"Next, it's your turn." Han Li looked at Dongli Hu and Zishan, speaking slowly.

"No choice, we can only resort to a fierce assault. If we still can't win later, don't worry about me, just burn everything within the Ten Directions' Array to ashes." Dongli Hu sighed, saying.

Zishan nodded silently after a moment.

Dongli Hu's eyes flashed with crystalline light, and his hands waved in the air, causing intense fluctuations in the laws of the universe to ripple out from his body. Behind him, the illusory images of towering mountains suddenly appeared.

"Han Li, dare you receive my Mountain-Crushing Fist?" Dongli Hu thundered.

"What's there to be afraid of?"

Han Li laughed, then tossed aside the Qingtian Bee Cloud Sword in his hand, allowing it to transform into a sword spirit child that flew to the side.

The next moment, he darted out, a golden spiritual realm instantly unfolding to envelop Dongli Hu.

Han Li's body shone with golden light, and countless golden ripples undulated through the spiritual realm, causing Dongli Hu to feel as if he had sunk into a quagmire, every step forward hindered by immense resistance.

Yet, he still shouted, his fist clenched and striking towards Han Li.

As his arm thrust forward, the mountain peak illusions behind him began to dissipate, transforming into streams of light that entered his arm and then his fist, causing half of his arm and his entire fist to radiate dazzling golden light.

At the same time, within the True Immortal Realm, numerous mountain peaks within several immortal domains suddenly exploded, their spiritual energy exhausted, their roots severed, and their peaks shattered without warning.

This fist's power was backed by the might of a hundred mountains.

Han Li watched this scene, his eyes not shocked but delighted, and a sense of excitement even arose in his heart.

"Come on..."

He shouted, and the True Speech Treasure Wheel and the other five temporal artifacts on his body emitted a burst of light, which flew into his body and caused his fist to condense a force of Five Elements Annihilation.

Han Li's eyes gleamed with intensity, and he struck out with his fist.

A deafening "boom" resounded!

Five formidable temporal laws converged, forming a massive golden fist that clashed with Dongli Hu's mountainous fist, the two forces colliding in a spectacular explosion.

In an instant, a ferocious and terrifying power swept towards the surroundings, directly compressing the space around them, causing the air to ripple and creating tiny, fleeting spatial rifts.

Unfortunately, those rifts were too small and only lasted for a moment before disappearing.

The massive explosion propelled Han Li and Dongli Hu backward, retreating tens of thousands of miles. Han Li's foot stepped on the void, and he emitted a loud "boom" as he charged forward once more.

"How is this possible?" Dongli Hu's heart tightened, his fist still trembling.

Just by comparing strength, he had lost to Han Li.

But just as he thought this, a sudden, piercing whistling sound echoed through the air.

A figure leapt out from behind Dongli Hu, holding a bow in one hand and a string in the other, with an arrow condensed from purple flames. With a swift motion, the arrow transformed into a purple glow, shooting towards Han Li at an unimaginable speed.

Han Li's True Speech Treasure Wheel spun rapidly, and he swept his hands in front of him, conjuring a series of temporal law ripples that resembled a shield.

However, the purple flame arrow pierced through the void, entering the temporal law ripples without hindrance, and shot straight towards Han Li's heart!
