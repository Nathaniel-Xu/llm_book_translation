"Everyone's strength has made great progress, not bad." Han Li's gaze swept over the three of them, Ti Hu, Xiao Bai, and Jing Yan Tongzi, and nodded in approval.

"Master has created such a good environment for us, if we don't work hard to cultivate, wouldn't that be ungrateful to you?" Ti Hu smiled.

"Master, why did you suddenly stop?" Xiao Bai asked.

He was in the middle of cultivating a secret technique, and just as he was about to reach the crucial point, he was interrupted, which made him feel unsatisfied.

"A thousandfold time difference space, isn't that something that can be set up easily? I estimate that it won't be possible to set it up again for a while." Han Li shook his head.

At this moment, the time dao patterns in his body had all become dim, and he needed time to slowly recover. Moreover...

Han Li turned to look at the Xian Yuan stone beside the Light Years Heavenly Array, which was almost depleted.

He had obtained the storage magic tool from Xi Tang, but the Xian Yuan stone inside was almost all gone, and had been used to purchase the Scattered Soul Ghost Flute.

The next time he wanted to use the time difference space, not only would he have to wait for the time dao patterns to recover, but he would also have to gather a large amount of Xian Yuan stone.

"If we recover to the same time flow as the outside world, it's unlikely that we'll have any significant breakthroughs in a short period of time." Xiao Bai sighed.

"You don't even thank Master for setting up the time difference space for us to cultivate, and yet you dare to speak in this tone." Ti Hu used the Scattered Soul Ghost Flute to knock on Xiao Bai's head.

A wail of ghostly energy invaded Xiao Bai's mind, causing his body to shudder.

"Ow!" Xiao Bai's divine soul felt like it had been bitten by a fierce ghost, and he jumped up in pain.

He wanted to pounce forward to retaliate, but after glancing at the Scattered Soul Ghost Flute, he didn't dare to.

"Alright, stop making a ruckus. Although I can't set up the time difference space, you can just consolidate your cultivation in the Flower Branch Space. I'll go take a look at the outside situation." Han Li separated Xiao Bai and Ti Hu, and then his figure flashed as he left the Flower Branch Space.

Ti Hu and Xiao Bai were just playing around, and didn't really want to fight. After Han Li left, they each found a place to sit down and continue cultivating.

Han Li went outside, and the few dao soldiers in the room were still there, without any abnormalities.

He nodded secretly, and looked out the window.

Below was a golden mountain range, shining brightly, and even the trees and plants had a golden color.

From this landscape, he couldn't determine where the Sun and Moon Divine Boat was currently located, so he opened the door and walked out.

However, he returned to the room in a short while.

Just now, he had gone out to ask around, and the Sun and Moon Divine Boat had already flown more than half the distance. If nothing unexpected happened, it would take around ten years to reach the Ninth Heaven City.

Han Li didn't return to the Flower Branch Space. Without the time difference space, it was all the same, and staying outside allowed him to respond to any unexpected movements of the Sun and Moon Divine Boat.

He sat down on the bed, crossed his legs, and took out a stack of jade slips.

These were the intelligence reports he had gathered in the Golden City, regarding the Great Golden Source Heavenly Domain and the Ninth Heaven Observatory. Although these reports were just trivial matters, it was always good to know more.

"Ah, what about that white-clothed nun?" Han Li's eyes lit up as he suddenly remembered something.

He had been so busy cultivating in the Flower Branch Space that he had almost forgotten about her.

Han Li's eyes gleamed with purple-black light as he looked towards the wall beside him.

The wall had a restrictive formation, and the room next door also had a restrictive formation, but how could they block Han Li's Nine Underworld Demon Eyes? The situation inside was clearly visible to him.

The white-clothed nun and the others were just sitting quietly, without anything happening.

Han Li's face was thoughtful, considering whether he should find an opportunity to directly ask the white-clothed nun if she was indeed Yu Meng Han, rather than just guessing.

At this moment, a commotion came from outside.

"Hmm, what's happening?" Han Li's eyebrows rose.

The wall in the room flashed with blue light, and a round light shadow appeared, with blue symbols forming a simple blue magic array.

"We respectfully inform all fellow daoists that a fifth-level golden wind is approaching, but everyone doesn't need to worry, the divine boat's defensive restrictive formations are sufficient to withstand it. Please remain calm and stay in your respective rooms, don't move around." A gentle voice came from the blue magic array.

"Golden wind..." Han Li's eyes flashed.

He had also investigated some information about the Great Golden Source Heavenly Domain, and understood that the golden attribute yuan qi was extremely rich.

It was precisely because the golden attribute yuan qi was too rich that it would occasionally cause a disturbance, forming a kind of heavenly calamity called the golden wind.

The golden wind's power varied, depending on its level, and the Great Golden Source Heavenly Domain divided it into nine levels, from lowest to highest.

A fifth-level golden wind was already quite powerful, but the Sun and Moon Divine Boat should be able to withstand it.

The voice from the magic array fell silent, and a loud rumbling sound came from the distance.

Han Li looked out the window, and saw a golden line appear in the distance, followed by a thunderous roar. The golden line quickly thickened, becoming a boundless golden windstorm.

The windstorm swept through, causing the entire space to fly sand and rocks, and a deafening roar echoed through the air. The mountains below were instantly destroyed, and countless golden rocks were swept up in the windstorm, rolling in with incredible speed.
"Turns out this is the Golden Gale, its power is indeed not small." Han Li muttered to himself.

At this moment, the outer wall of the Sun Moon Divine Vessel flashed with blue light, and a thick layer of blue light condensed into a protective shield, covering the entire vessel.

The blue light shield flashed with countless star patterns, resembling the True Extreme Membrane of a Xian cultivator, giving off an unbreakable feeling.

Just as the Sun Moon Divine Vessel had deployed its shield, the Golden Gale stormed in.

The entire sky suddenly darkened, and then a loud, earth-shattering sound erupted, causing the Sun Moon Divine Vessel to violently shake and be blown away, with a scream coming from within.

At this moment, the restrictive talismans on the Sun Moon Divine Vessel glowed brightly, like a flowing star cloud, and quickly stabilized the vessel in the midst of the storm, continuing to move forward, albeit at a much slower speed.

Han Li, of course, was not intimidated by this minor event, and he carefully sensed the situation outside the Golden Gale with his divine sense.

At this moment, a figure flashed in the Flower Branch Space, and Ti Hou's figure flew out, landing in the room.

"Master, I sense a panicked emotion coming from outside, what's happening?" Ti Hou asked with a serious expression.

She immediately saw the Golden Gale raging outside the vessel, and her face revealed a look of surprise.

"It's just a special heavenly calamity in this Xian domain, the Sun Moon Divine Vessel has encountered it, so the passengers are a bit panicked." Han Li explained.

"Ah, I see." Ti Hou's expression relaxed.

"Ti Hou, you're here, I have something I want to ask of you. There's a female cultivator in the next room, who looks like an old friend I met in the lower realm, but it's been many years, and I'm not sure, can you help me investigate?" Han Li asked.

With Ti Hou's divine sense, it should be easy to investigate the Gold Xian cultivator from afar.

"No problem, who is it?" Ti Hou replied, slightly startled, and nodded.

"The white-robed nun in the next room." Han Li pointed to the adjacent room.

"She's a beauty, is she the master's love interest?" Ti Hou's divine sense swept towards the next room, and her small mouth pursed, her slender fingers intertwining.

"She's just an old friend, not someone I'm familiar with, otherwise I would have recognized her myself, and wouldn't have bothered you." Han Li shook his head and smiled.

"I'll just cast a spell to investigate." Ti Hou chuckled, nodded, and began to weave a spell with her hands.

But just as she was about to release the spell, Ti Hou's expression suddenly changed, and she let out a soft "ah" sound, stopping her hand.

"What's wrong?" Han Li asked.

"The people in the next room are quite strange, especially one of them, who's even more interesting." Ti Hou smiled mysteriously.

"Interesting?" Han Li was taken aback.

"I think they're about to make a move, Master, if you're interested, you can come and take a look, we can investigate later." Ti Hou smiled enigmatically.

Han Li's interest was piqued, and he turned his Jiu You Magic Eye towards the next room.

In the next room, the white-robed nun and the others had stopped their cultivation, looking at the raging Golden Gale outside with fear in their eyes.

They were all Gold Xian cultivators, and if they were outside at this moment, they would likely be reduced to dust.

The Golden Gale was getting stronger, and golden wind blades began to appear, slashing at the Sun Moon Divine Vessel's blue shield.

"Boom boom boom..." The sound of countless explosions echoed, releasing boundless flames, but the blue shield remained unbroken.

However, the shield couldn't block the deafening sound, which penetrated into the Sun Moon Divine Vessel, causing the passengers with lower cultivation to feel their qi and blood churning, and they felt extremely uncomfortable.

The white-robed nun and the others' room was near the ship's wall, and the sound was the loudest, so they had set up over a dozen layers of restrictive talismans, and even taken out their own magical instruments to protect themselves, but unfortunately, they had little effect against this heavenly calamity.

The group's faces were all pale, and they could only grit their teeth and endure.

"Ah!" The gray-robed old man's face suddenly turned red, and he spat out a mouthful of blood, his aura becoming disordered.

"Brother Sun, are you okay?" The red-robed woman nearby asked anxiously.

The black-robed youth looked over, his face filled with concern.

The white-robed nun's eyes flickered, but her expression remained calm, without any change.

The triangular-eyed man glanced at the gray-robed old man, and his eyes flashed with disdain.

"It's nothing, I was injured in a battle some time ago, and my internal injuries haven't healed yet, the shock just triggered my old wounds." The gray-robed old man took a deep breath, and waved his hand.

The red-robed woman and the black-robed youth's faces relaxed.

"Everyone, this Golden Gale will continue for a while, and if we keep getting shaken like this, we'll all suffer internal injuries. I have a spatial magical instrument that can protect us from this shock." The gray-robed old man took out a pill and swallowed it, hesitated for a moment, and then said.
