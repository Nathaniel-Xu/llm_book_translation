Han Li, my old body's cycle of life and death is unpredictable, and the last life-and-death battle was hundreds of millions of years ago. The transformation from prosperity to decline has also taken hundreds of millions of years. Today, I can use these two divine trees to transform from decline to prosperity, and it is your fate to face this great calamity. Die!" Zhu Yan, who had suddenly transformed into a young woman, laughed loudly.

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her hand, and the black long hair that had spread out behind her suddenly burst forth like a dense vine, transforming into a black tide that covered the sky and earth, swallowing her small figure in an instant.

Han Li's eyes swept across the area, and he saw that the void within a radius of tens of thousands of miles was quickly occupied by the black hair.

He raised his hand, and the seventy-two Qingtong Fengyun Swords flew to his front, forming a massive circular sword array in the void.

"Go!"

Han Li's low voice was heard, and the seventy-two Qingtong Fengyun Swords suddenly let out a loud whistling sound, spinning at high speed in the void like a windmill.

In an instant, electrical currents shot out, like countless lightning whips striking the heavens, and countless sharp sword energies condensed into substance, shooting out in all directions, instantly crushing the surging black hair.

On the other side, Zisu saw this scene and didn't immediately come to help. Instead, she turned around and pulled up the heavily injured Dongli Tiger, and with a flash of her body, she sent him out of the large array.

Han Li controlled the sword array, charging towards Zhu Yan, and his path was unobstructed.

However, after advancing for several thousand miles, Han Li suddenly discovered that the black hair he had cut off behind him was floating in mid-air, surrounding him from all sides.

"Han Li, try my move!" A loud voice suddenly rang out.

The scattered black hair in the air suddenly flashed with light, and it automatically connected with each other, coiling towards the center like a massive black whirlpool, pulling Han Li's power into it.

The Qingtong Fengyun Swords' sword array was also instantly destroyed, and all the sword blades were tightly wrapped by the black hair, struggling and trembling violently.

Han Li himself was in the center of the whirlpool, with his hands, feet, and waist all wrapped by the black hair, and his surroundings were also compressed by the thick black hair, his bones creaking loudly, making it difficult for him to break free.

At the same time, a mysterious law fluctuation flowed into Han Li's body, following the surging black hair.

Han Li felt as if a layer of continuous water waves was constantly washing over his body.

Under this wave-like power, he didn't feel any pain, but every time the wave washed over him, Han Li felt as if something in his body was slowly flowing away.

He looked down at his arm, and his skin had become dry and wrinkled, as if he had instantly aged from a young man to an old man.

"This isn't an illusion, how is this possible?" Han Li was shocked.

This kind of technique that accelerated the flow of time, making one's lifespan rapidly decline, Han Li also knew, but it was through the power of time laws to accelerate the opponent's lifespan decline. Zhu Yan shouldn't have this kind of divine power.

Moreover, he had already become a nearly immortal existence, so how could he have aged so much in just a few dozen breaths?

After a moment of thought, Han Li gradually calmed down.

He quietly operated the Xianling power within his body, and the withered skin on his arm instantly lit up with a blue glow, restoring it to its original state.

But in an instant, the skin on his arm withered again, and it could only be restored after the Xianling power replenished it.

In this way, the wave-like power and Han Li's Xianling power fell into a tug-of-war, acting on Han Li's body, causing his skin to change back and forth between withering and flourishing like the leaves of a tree in spring and autumn.

Moreover, with this change repeating, Han Li could sense that the power was slowly penetrating through his skin, seeping into his bones. If this continued, his body would eventually be corroded.

"Since you're using a fake time flow, I'll give you a real one." Han Li sneered.

As soon as he finished speaking, his spiritual domain suddenly contracted, covering only a radius of ten thousand miles, and the Zhenyan Baolun and other time law objects returned to his spiritual domain, transforming into the sun, moon, stars, and mountains, creating a five-element fantasy world.

Within the five-element fantasy world, the flow of time suddenly accelerated a thousandfold, and Zhu Yan's cycle of life and death also accelerated a thousandfold. Han Li's skin changes also accelerated a thousandfold.

However, he had already prepared for this, and he quickly operated the Tianxia Zhenjin Gong, covering his body with a layer of starlight-like True Extreme membrane.

In this way, Zhu Yan's cycle of life and death had a much slower effect on him.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Han Li's eyes turned towards the distant sky.

The Golden Child's true body was shining brightly in the dark sky, and the surrounding void was rippling with intense spatial waves, and the void had already collapsed by half, although it was still unstable.

Han Li's heart was filled with joy, and his eyes returned to Zhu Yan, who was hidden behind the dense black hair.

The latter's face was tense, and it was clear that she wasn't easy either.

After about a quarter of an hour, Han Li was still struggling to break free from Zhu Yan's restraints, but the black hair that had spread out had clearly retracted, and many places had turned silver-white, as if they had been sprinkled with frost.
Han Li saw the situation and a hint of a smile appeared on his lips.

The rate at which the Zhu Yan's withering law affected him was far slower than the rate at which the Heavenly Dao was eroding her, so he only needed to wait until she could no longer hold on, and then he would counterattack.

As he thought about this, the dao patterns on the True Speech Treasure Wheel and other law incarnations began to shine brightly, accelerating time by a hundredfold.

Zhu Yan was also feeling quite anxious at this moment, originally thinking that she could use her own law to wither Han Li's physical body, but he not only had a physique far beyond her imagination, but also caused her own law's power to be consumed at an alarming rate.

As Han Li's time law power continued to increase, Zhu Yan's long black hair suddenly turned white, more than half of it.

She felt a sense of unease in her heart, and no longer dared to hesitate, her long hair suddenly shrinking, releasing Han Li, and retreating like a tide.

"You want to leave?" Han Li sneered, grabbing Zhu Yan's hair with one hand.

A silver light flashed in his palm, and a silver flame erupted, spreading out over tens of thousands of miles, burning towards Zhu Yan.

But just as this was happening, a figure suddenly appeared, landing on Zhu Yan's black hair.

It was Zi Shu, who pressed his hands down, and purple flames erupted from his palms, instantly suppressing the silver flames, and pushing the fire back towards Han Li.

After forcing Han Li back, Zi Shu turned to Zhu Yan and said, "I'll take care of this, you go and stop the Jin Jin insect, it's almost too late..."

"You're already too late," Han Li laughed loudly.

He pointed with one hand, and the 72 Sword Spirit Infants flew out, rushing towards the Golden Child.

As the flying swords shot out, a loud rumbling sound was heard, and the Heavenly Thunder temporarily ceased its power, but the ancient sword energy within began to surge, bursting out in a riot of colors.

"Stop it!" Zi Shu shouted.

Zhu Yan's long hair immediately sprawled out, chasing after the Qing Zhu Sword.

Han Li saw this, and with a wave of his hand, the broken time and space fire that had transformed into stars in the sky began to fall like a meteor shower, creating massive waves wherever they passed.

The waves passed, and a layer of time law power enveloped Zhu Yan and Zi Shu, making them feel like they had been trapped in a river of frozen time.

Immediately, a real river of time flowed in, like a jade ribbon, encircling them, and solidifying the time restriction.

Han Li saw this, and with another wave of his hand, the full moon descended from the sky, hanging above the two of them, releasing a golden light.

Having learned from his previous mistake, he did not use the mountain range and the Dong Yi divine wood forest this time.

Han Li had just trapped the two of them when he heard a loud noise coming from afar.

"Boom..."

He quickly looked up, and saw that the Qing Zhu Sword had struck down a sword, and then transformed back into a Sword Spirit Infant, flying back towards him.

On the other side, the void in front of the Golden Child had opened up, revealing a massive mouth, over a thousand feet long, and although it was also pitch black, one could faintly sense that there was a thread of wind seeping through.

The Ten Directions Great Array had finally been torn open. Han Li's heart was filled with joy, and he retreated, intending to go and examine the opening, but suddenly felt a powerful aura behind him, which was growing stronger by the second.

He turned around, and saw that in the time restriction he had created, a purple light was shining brightly, and growing more intense, like a purple sun.

Han Li's brow furrowed, worried that the True Speech Treasure Wheel and other objects would be damaged, and he quickly withdrew the restriction.

At the same time, he hastily flew backwards.

...

Above the Yaochi, the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation, the Demon Lord, Li Yuan Ji, and Chi Rong surrounded Guo or Jin, who was trapped in the middle.

"Guo or Jin, I have been planning for countless years, and it is all for this battle today, surrender now!" The Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation looked at Guo or Jin, his eyes flashing with a hint of blood red, and said.

"Lord, are you sure you have already won?" Guo or Jin was surrounded by the four of them, but he was not afraid, and calmly replied.

"Given the current situation, do you still have any means to turn the tables? Your powerful subordinates are scattered throughout the Middle Realm, and I have already sealed off all the transmission arrays in the Heavenly Court, so if you are counting on someone to return to reinforce, I advise you to give up that thought." The Demon Lord glanced at the Heavenly Court cultivators, who were almost unable to hold on, and sneered.

These cultivators were not particularly strong in front of the Daozu or the Da Luo realm cultivators, but they were the foundation of the Heavenly Court's control over the various realms, and if they were all destroyed today, the Heavenly Court would be severely weakened.
