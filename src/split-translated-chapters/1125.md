"Rumbling sounds..."

As the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor clashed with the Ta Sui's residual soul, the dark clouds in the sky grew thick, and although there was no lightning, a low rumbling sound could be heard.

The air around them was filled with a howling wind, and the ground trembled slightly, as if the entire Sui Yue Tower space was becoming unstable.

"Brother Han, the Sui Yue Lamp must not fall into Qi Mozi's hands, we must retrieve it," Jiao San said gravely to Han Li.

"Jiao San, Qi Mozi is a powerful cultivator in the Da Luo realm, not only is his strength formidable, but his cunning is also deep, and now that he has obtained the Sui Yue Lamp, he is like a tiger with wings, we should not pursue him now," Han Li replied with a hint of hesitation.

He had already shaken off the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor's mind control, and no longer had the same fervor for the Sui Yue Lamp.

"Brother Han, you and Qi Mozi have a grudge, why are you retreating now?" Jiao San asked urgently.

"I do have a grudge with him, but the gap in our strength is too great, and the Sui Yue Lamp's movement has lifted the tower's restrictions, it's not safe to stay here, we should leave quickly," Han Li replied nonchalantly.

"To be honest, Brother Han, Qi Mozi not only has the Sui Yue Lamp, but also took the key item from our Wheel of Reincarnation Hall's mission, we must retrieve it. As a member of the Wheel of Reincarnation, you should also participate," Jiao San said, glancing at Qi Mozi's direction with a hint of anxiety.

"Jiao San, don't force me, this is not my task, although I am a member of the Wheel of Reincarnation, I am not qualified to participate in a task of this level," Han Li replied calmly.

Jiao San's face stiffened, not expecting Han Li to use her previous words to deflect her.

"Brother Han, if I'm not mistaken, there's a young man named Jin Tong who is quite close to you, his situation is not looking good," Jiao San said, her voice low and urgent.

"What do you mean?" Han Li asked, his expression unchanged, but his heart tightened.

"This is a long story, I'll explain later, but taking down Qi Mozi is crucial for your young friend, please don't hesitate, act quickly. Qi Mozi's cultivation of the Time Law is not to be underestimated, without your help, it will be troublesome," Jiao San said, her face anxious.

Just as they were speaking, Huo San had already caught up with Liu Zixin, who was chasing after Qi Mozi, as the latter had his life-bound token.

"Since that's the case, I'll help you, but afterwards, I'll take the Sui Yue Lamp, is that acceptable?" Han Li asked.

In reality, he had an unresolved grudge with Qi Mozi, and now that he had the chance, he wanted to kill him to eliminate the threat, but since Jiao San had asked for his help, he would have to play along and make her owe him a favor.

However, Jiao San's mention of Jin Tong's situation was unexpected, and Han Li's heart clouded over with a hint of unease.

"Alright, I agree, but Brother Han, please don't fight over the other items on Qi Mozi's body," Jiao San said, nodding without hesitation.

Han Li naturally had no objections.

After they agreed, Jiao San's body flashed with a bright light, and she took off in pursuit of Qi Mozi.

Just then, a silver light flew out from the ruins of the great hall, and it was the Jing Yan Fire Bird, carrying the Fire Pearl, one of the five artifacts that made up the Wu Xing Mie Kong Great Array.

"It seems that the great array is no longer stable without someone to control it," Han Li muttered to himself, and he took the Fire Pearl from the Fire Bird.

He glanced at the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor and the Ta Sui's residual soul, who were still fighting, and the terrifying shockwaves they were creating, and he shuddered slightly.

Just as he was about to leave, he saw Qu Lin and Li Qi Ma transforming into human form, searching for something in the ruins of the great hall.

He flew over to them, and said with a smile, "Don't just watch, come help me retrieve the lamp."

"Retrieve what lamp? Old Ancestor is busy, you go play by yourself, don't come and bother me," Li Qi Ma said, not even looking at Han Li, his voice impatient.

"Qu Dao friend, he won't help, what about you? We had an agreement earlier, to help me deal with an enemy, and now he's right there," Han Li said, pointing to the distance, where Jiao San and the others had already caught up with Qi Mozi.

"We had an agreement, and I won't go back on my word, but I have more important things to attend to, you have enough people to deal with him," Qu Lin said, without hesitation.

"Are you two...?" Han Li said, a smile spreading across his face.

Qu Lin turned to look at him, and Li Qi Ma put away his cigarette, and also looked at Han Li.

And that's when they saw Han Li holding two blood-red tokens, waving them casually at them.

"Ah, you're looking for these?" Han Li asked, his smile widening.
Han Li had originally not planned to take out the two nameplates, especially the one belonging to Qu Lin, because having it in his possession would give him an ace up his sleeve when facing Jin Tong in the future.

To prevent them from sensing it, Han Li had added a layer of restriction to the nameplates and stored them in the Flower Branch Cave Heaven. However, he had to take them out now to get their help.

"Ah, good kid, you really have it," Li Qi said with a smile, his mouth wide open. "I told you before, if you can find back my old ancestor's nameplate, I'll definitely thank you heavily. Now it's time to fulfill that promise."

"Ah, Daoist Li, don't be in a hurry. The thank you can wait until I've dealt with Qi Mozi," Han Li said, flipping his hand to retrieve the two nameplates.

"You're a sly kid, not letting the rabbit go until you've released the hawk," Li Qi said, his face stiffening in anger.

"Then let's kill that person first," Qu Lin said, his brow furrowing.

The two of them finished speaking, and Li Qi's body was suddenly enveloped in a white whirlwind, disappearing from the spot.

Han Li and Qu Lin followed closely behind, chasing after him.

The group from the Tongtian Sword Sect had already retreated to a distance of several hundred li, taking advantage of the chaos. Daoyin Zhenren, who had been carried on Lei Yu's back, finally woke up.

He coughed lightly and turned his head to look behind him, seeing that the sky and earth had changed colors, and the entire space was in chaos.

"What's going on?" Daoyin Zhenren asked, his voice trembling.

"Master, you're awake?" Lei Yu exclaimed, quickly putting him down.

He roughly explained what had happened after Daoyin Zhenren had fainted, and Daoyin Zhenren's brow furrowed in concern.

"What? Old ancestor's residual soul has descended... Ah, this is a disaster... If the divine lamp is not in our hands, once it's moved, we won't be able to maintain the sealing power of the Years Tower. If the demons in the tower escape, we'll be the ones who brought chaos to the Jin Yuan Immortal Realm."

"Master, our current situation is already fortunate enough. We can't worry about too much right now," a senior disciple said to comfort him.

"No, the reputation of the Tongtian Sword Sect can't be ruined on my watch. The immortal lord's residual soul is still fighting against the Black Sky Old Demon, and I'll risk my life to retrieve the divine lamp and re-seal the demons in the tower," Daoyin Zhenren said, his face stern.

"Master, the divine lamp has been moved for a long time, and the demons in the tower may have already escaped. We have disciples from various sects stationed outside the tower, and they should be able to block them for a while. What we need to do right now is to quickly leave the Years Tower and the entire ancient relic space, and find a way to activate the immortal lord's last trump card," Lei Yu said urgently.

"You mean, destroying the Years Tower and the entire ancient relic space together?" Daoyin Zhenren asked, his expression calming down.

"If we let the demons in the tower escape into the immortal realm, many more people will die. It's a difficult choice, but it's the lesser of two evils," Lei Yu said, his face serious.

"If we don't do this, the consequences will be severe. These people who have entered the ancient relic space are already doomed. The divine lamp will eventually return to our sect, and we'll use it to restore our glory," Daoyin Zhenren said, his face stern.

Su Zhuqian opened her mouth to speak, but ultimately said nothing.

After they finished speaking, the group headed towards the edge of the seven-layer space, where they could exit the tower without the restriction.

After they left, a black rock not far from them suddenly rolled to the side, and a figure emerged from the ground. It was Xiong Shan.

He removed a golden talisman from his brow and carefully stored it away, then let out a long sigh.

"Those people from the Tongtian Sword Sect are going to destroy the entire ancient relic space. I need to leave immediately..."

He flipped his hand, and a golden long sword and a yellow earth seal appeared in front of him, which were the two immortal tools he had used to set up the Five Elements Concealment Array. However, their light had dimmed, and they seemed to have consumed a lot of energy.

"Fortunately, I have you two. This time, I almost lost my life, but at least I didn't come up empty-handed," he said, smiling as he carefully put away the sword and seal.

After that, he stood up and glanced at the chaotic battlefield in the distance, then spat on the ground and said, "You can continue playing. I'll leave first."

As soon as he finished speaking, he saw a blue light flash by above him, and it seemed that the woman named Lan Yan was also flying away.

He furrowed his brow and followed suit, flying away from the chaotic scene.
