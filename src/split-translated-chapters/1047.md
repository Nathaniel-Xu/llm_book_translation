Han Li's hand grasped the sword hilt, and with a swift motion, he sheathed the sword by his side. At the same time, his other hand formed a sword seal, and with a fierce swing, he unleashed a powerful strike.

"Zhilak..." A burst of electricity flashed, and a series of golden lightning bolts shot out from the sword, coalescing into a golden electric blade that sliced through the air.

The golden light in the void was like a knife cutting through tofu, splitting apart with ease, and the two sides of the golden light churned and surged, dispersing in all directions, revealing a clear and empty space in the middle.

The golden bird seemed to be wary of the golden electric blade's ferocity, and with a swift flap of its wings, it shot upwards, fleeing towards the upper reaches.

Han Li followed the sword light's trajectory, his eyes fixed on the opening, and his expression changed slightly.

In the distance, he saw over a hundred golden stone pillars, each one adorned with intricate symbols, and on top of each pillar, a metal beast with a different shape and form lay motionless.

As the golden light passed by, the metal beasts' eyes snapped open, and they jumped down from the pillars, their bodies low to the ground, like predators stalking their prey, and began to move towards Han Li.

The sword light from the Qing Zhu Xi Yun Sword gradually dissipated, and the golden light in the surroundings began to spread, covering Han Li's figure.

"What's going on?" Yu Kuohai and the others noticed something amiss and shouted loudly.

There was silence in the golden light, and no one responded.

Except for the few people who had been sent out to search for the array's core, the rest of the group felt a strange sensation, and they couldn't help but gather together.

"Is there something inside this golden light?" Yang Lao looked at the golden light and hesitated.

The others heard his words and felt even more uneasy, their faces tense with anxiety.

Just then, a sudden burst of footsteps echoed from the front, and the group quickly grasped their weapons, on high alert.

A figure suddenly emerged from the golden light, shouting, "Ah, it's me, don't attack!"

"Shi Dao friend..." Yu Kuohai quickly stopped the others and asked, "What's wrong?"

"Yu Dao friend, there are metal beasts here, many, many metal beasts..." Han Li's figure appeared, his expression tense.

"I thought it was something else, but it's just metal beasts..." Yu Kuohai's expression relaxed slightly, and he said.

As soon as he finished speaking, several broken and battered corpses flew in from different directions, landing at the group's feet.

Han Li looked closely and saw that they were the people who had been sent out to search for the array's core.

Before the group could react, more bursts of footsteps echoed from the surroundings.

"They're coming..." Han Li whispered.

As he spoke, his eyes fell on the Lan siblings.

The two of them seemed to have already discovered the anomaly, and not only did they not gather with the others, but they also kept a distance, standing back-to-back, their faces expressionless.

"This is a good opportunity to test your skills..." Han Li's eyes flashed with a hint of a smile.

A fierce gust of wind swept in, and a series of golden wind blades swirled towards the group, forming a massive golden dragon that surrounded them.

The golden light in the surroundings dissipated, and the group's vision cleared slightly.

However, what they saw made their hearts tremble with fear â€“ over a hundred massive golden figures had appeared, each one a different shape and form, including tigers, leopards, wolves, snakes, eagles, and mice.

Each of the metal beasts emitted an aura of immense power.

Yu Kuohai looked on, his face filled with regret, wishing he could take back his previous words.

In all his years of exploring the Golden Source Mountains, he had never seen such metal beasts, nor had he ever seen such a formation.

"Wangyou Pavilion disciples, quickly form an array!" Zhao Vice Pavilion Master shouted.

"Yes!"

The Wangyou Pavilion disciples quickly gathered around Zhao Vice Pavilion Master, their hands moving in unison as they conjured up golden wheels that hovered above their heads, forming a massive golden wheel array.

As they chanted and the golden wheels vibrated, the array began to take shape, with golden light circles spreading outwards, like a blooming flower.

"Let's form a joint array!" Yu Kuohai exclaimed.

The Ling Xiao Sect and Lie Guang City didn't have enough people to form a strong array, so they decided to join forces with the Wangyou Pavilion.

"We can't form a joint array," Zhao Vice Pavilion Master said, his eyes flashing with cunning. "Our cultivation methods are different, and our arrays won't be compatible. It's better for your sect to form its own array."

Yu Kuohai glared at him, then turned to Yang Lao, and the two sects began to set up their own arrays.

In reality, they were just setting up their own individual arrays, hoping to combine them to increase their strength.

"Shi Dao friend, what's wrong? Why are you still standing there? Come and join the array!" Yu Kuohai shouted, noticing Han Li still standing in the distance, looking at the Lan siblings.

Han Li's eyes seemed to be fixed on the Lan siblings, and his expression was unreadable.
Han Li turned his head to glance at the two factions, seeing the two layers of light screens above their heads, one red and one blue. A hint of pity flashed in his eyes, and he lazily opened his mouth to say:

"I specially came back to warn you, meaning to let you prepare to escape. How can you not understand, with such a formation, what can you defend against?"

"You scoundrel, what nonsense are you talking about?" Yu Kuohai's eyes flashed with a hint of doubt, and he shouted in anger.

"Never mind, life and death are predestined, you all take care of yourselves." Han Li smiled indifferently, no longer looking at them.

As soon as his words fell, the metal beasts surrounding them began to attack. A golden giant wolf took the lead, lifting a front paw, its claws like golden knife blades slashing through the air, directly striking the golden wheel formation above the Wuyou Pavilion disciples' heads.

"Full power, activate the formation!" Zhao, the deputy pavilion master, roared.

All the Wuyou Pavilion cultivators followed with a loud shout, crazily activating their spiritual energy. The golden light above the golden wheel formation burst forth, its radiance surpassing even the golden force field itself.

As the wolf's claws touched the formation, a sharp, ear-piercing sound echoed out. The seemingly indestructible golden wheel formation was torn open, revealing three massive gashes, and golden blades shot out from the openings, followed by a cacophony of shattering sounds.

The formation, set up by the combined efforts of many golden immortals, was not weak, but under the metal beast's attack, it was like mud being squeezed, without any resistance.

The Wuyou Pavilion cultivators' golden wheels shattered, exploding into countless golden fragments. The space was filled with the sounds of screams and wailing, as the cultivators were killed or injured.

Yu Kuohai's expression finally turned to terror as he witnessed the scene.

The Wuyou Pavilion's formation was unable to withstand the attack, and their hastily assembled formation was of no use.

"Disperse and break through, find a chance to escape..." Yu Kuohai shouted.

The Ling Xiao Sect and Lie Guang City cultivators had already been on edge, and upon hearing his words, they immediately activated their strongest survival techniques, scattering in all directions.

The space was filled with a kaleidoscope of lights, but all were suppressed by the golden force field, their effects greatly diminished.

Their actions seemed to provoke the metal beasts, which simultaneously attacked, biting and tearing at the cultivators. The space descended into chaos, with wailing sounds echoing everywhere.

Yu Kuohai's robes glowed with a blue light, and his body was covered in a layer of golden scales, which shone with an extraordinary radiance. He seemed to be able to move freely, unaffected by the golden force field.

If not for the metal beasts surrounding him, he would have already escaped a dozen miles away.

Yang, the elder of Lie Guang City, had changed into a crimson robe, transforming into a giant crimson fire python, also moving freely through the crowd.

Wherever he passed, flames burned, scorching many of his fellow cultivators, but he didn't have time to care, only trying to avoid the metal beasts' attacks and find a way to escape.

Just then, a clear, ringing sound echoed from above, and a golden eagle swooped down, its talons swiping at the fire python's body.

Yang felt the terrifying golden energy emanating from the eagle and barely avoided its attack, only to collide with Han Li.

"Get out of my way..." Yang shouted, his anger burning brighter.

Han Li slightly furrowed his brow, turned his head, and slapped Yang with a palm.

Yang's anger intensified, and he spat out a stream of intense flames, engulfing Han Li.

"You're looking for death..." Yang sneered.

But then, he saw a thick hand emerge from the flames, drawing a circular arc in the air, before slapping Yang's head with a loud "pap".

Yang felt a massive force crash down on him, and his consciousness began to blur. When he regained his senses, he found himself trapped in the eagle's talons.

"No..."

His voice was cut off as the eagle tore his body into three pieces, which were then swallowed by three metal beasts.

Han Li turned his head, no longer paying attention to Yang, and this scene was witnessed by the fleeing Yu Kuohai. His heart felt as if it had been struck by lightning, and his mind went blank.

When he regained his senses, a bitter taste filled his mouth, and he cursed Han Li for being a heartless actor, while praying that he wouldn't settle the score with him later.

Han Li didn't even notice them, and if Yang hadn't provoked him, he wouldn't have bothered with him.

At this moment, Han Li's gaze fell upon the "Lan siblings" in the distance.
