Just as Jintong and Xueli were at a stalemate, a loud thunderclap echoed through the sky, and a massive golden lightning cloud had formed, with a magnificent heavenly gate standing tall.

"Move aside!" Han Li shouted.

Jintong relaxed his claws, and his body flashed with golden light, transforming back into a girl's form before disappearing in an instant.

A golden giant sword then descended from the sky, splitting the heavens and bringing with it a torrent of thunder and lightning.

Xueli saw this and knew he was in trouble, attempting to dodge to the side. However, a wave of rainbow-colored light suddenly enveloped him from above.

As the light washed over him, Xueli's eyes felt a wave of dizziness, and his spirit seemed to be violently shaken.

"Boom boom boom!"

The golden giant sword shot out golden electric threads, sealing off the entire area within a thousand miles.

Xueli's eyes flashed with golden light, and he regained his composure. However, it was too late for him to escape.

He glared at the person who had cast the spell, Ti Yu, before raising his massive axe and striking upwards.

His body glowed with a fierce blood light, and his axe grew to enormous size, its surface covered in a swirling vortex of blood-colored light. The axe struck the golden giant sword, causing a massive explosion.

A deafening boom echoed through the sky, and a brilliant light burst forth, splitting into two massive arc-shaped shockwaves that expanded outwards.

The shockwaves swept through the area, erasing everything in their path. The ghostly army that had been pursuing them was instantly decimated, with only a few of the stronger ones surviving.

The ghostly army's commander, a powerful ghost soldier, let out a shout, and the army halted their advance, not daring to approach.

Jintong struggled to breathe in the face of the massive shockwaves, using his strength to protect the injured Ti Yu as they retreated.

After a while, the dust and debris finally settled.

The thundercloud and heavenly gate had vanished, and Han Li's figure hovered in the air, gazing down.

The stone bridge, despite being made of unknown materials, had withstood the massive impact without sustaining any damage. Xueli still stood on the bridge, his axe still in hand.

However, a massive wound had appeared on his neck, stretching from the base of his skull to the center of his chest. The wound was so deep that it had split his chest cavity in two.

Han Li could see the internal organs still moving within the wound, but Xueli's body remained motionless, without any sign of life.

"Is he dead?" Han Li's brow furrowed in confusion.

He didn't dare to approach Xueli, instead flying over to Jintong and Ti Yu.

"Uncle, did we win?" Jintong asked.

Han Li shook his head, his expression uncertain. "How is she?" he asked Ti Yu.

Ti Yu forced a smile. "The wound isn't too severe, but there's a strange power at work, preventing the blood from healing."

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he examined the wound before placing his hand on Ti Yu's neck.

As the time law's power flowed through him, a small green sprout emerged from his palm.

The sprout grew a root, which entered Ti Yu's wound.

Ti Yu gritted her teeth as the root began to repair the damage. A small golden tree, resembling Han Li's Dongyi divine tree, appeared on her back, its roots stitching together the torn flesh.

Under the power of the time law, the wound healed quickly, and the roots dissipated into a burst of golden light.

"It seems that Xueli has mastered a kind of reincarnation law, which can cause your wound to continuously reopen, preventing it from healing. I used the time law to break this cycle," Han Li explained.

Ti Yu nodded. "Thank you, Master."

Han Li's gaze turned serious. "This place is full of mysteries. We've been delayed by Xueli for too long, and those ghostly creatures will catch up to us soon. Let's leave for now."

Jintong and Ti Yu had no objections, especially Jintong, who had been eager to leave.
Just as the three were speaking, a wave of law fluctuations suddenly emanated from Xue Li's body on the stone bridge, and a crimson vortex appeared on his chest, rotating counterclockwise and expanding until it engulfed his entire body.

"What is this?" This scene shocked both Ti Hu and Jin Tong.

"Don't mind this guy, let's hurry and leave." Han Li gazed at Xue Li from a distance, a hint of abnormality flashing in his eyes, and then said.

The three immediately turned and flew towards the other end of the stone bridge without looking back.

After they disappeared from sight, the crimson vortex suddenly began to rotate clockwise, and a tall figure emerged from it, its upper body bare and headless.

It was Xue Li.

Compared to earlier, his injuries had completely recovered, and even his breath had returned to its previous state.

"Hmph, they actually escaped, otherwise I would have made them taste my power... If not for the old wounds, I would have used a small wheel of reincarnation technique, and it wouldn't have taken so long." Xue Li's abdomen fluttered, and he coldly snorted, saying.

After speaking, he suddenly covered his heart with his hand, and his body swayed a few steps.

At this time, a commotion suddenly erupted from the other end of the stone bridge, and the group of Yin Sha ghosts that had been standing still earlier began to approach.

However, just as they were about to step onto the bridge, the ghost general at the forefront suddenly stopped, raised his fist, and ordered everyone to halt.

The ghost general looked at the headless man on the bridge, hesitated for a moment, and then called out in a tentative tone:

"Xue Li, sir..."

The headless man heard the voice, turned his head, and looked at the ghost general. After recognizing him, his abdomen began to flutter again, and he said:

"Yin Luo, is that you?"

The ghost general heard the words, immediately ran forward, and knelt down before Xue Li, bowing his head to the ground and respectfully saying:

"Your subordinate Yin Luo, greets Xue Li, sir."

The large group of ghosts standing at the end of the bridge also knelt down, trembling with fear, and did not dare to rise.

Xue Li gazed at Yin Luo for a long time, seemingly lost in thought.

"Get up..." After a while, Xue Li let out a long sigh, his abdomen fluttering as he said.

"Congratulations, Xue Li, sir, you have finally escaped." Yin Luo did not immediately rise, but instead straightened his upper body, his face filled with joy.

"It was those people from the immortal realm who helped me escape. However, it seems that you are pursuing them?" Xue Li said.

"Not bad, these people somehow invaded here, and I was unable to intercept them, so I've been pursuing them until now." Yin Luo said.

"I originally wanted to kill them after escaping, but those people still have some abilities, and I've been sealed for a long time, with internal injuries, and they were able to escape." Xue Li said.

"Sir, your injuries..." Yin Luo's words were cut off by Xue Li, who waved his hand to stop him.

"Tell me, what happened after I was sealed away?" Xue Li asked.

"After you disappeared, our forces were left without a leader and fell into internal strife. Later, I don't know where the information came from, but it was said that you were imprisoned in the Guicheng of the ghost witch. Yin Qiu, Fan Li, and I led a group to attack the Guicheng, but we were defeated. Fan Li died in battle, and most of his ghostly followers defected to the underworld king, while a small portion directly surrendered to the ghost witch." Yin Luo replied.

"What about Yin Qiu?" Xue Li asked.

"Yin Qiu and I have never gotten along, and we parted ways after that. I remained in our original territory, while he gradually disappeared, and it's said that he was recruited by the Zhuanlun Wang." Yin Luo said.

"Zhuanlun Wang?" Xue Li asked, puzzled.

"That's the mysterious person who collaborated with the underworld king and the ghost witch to seal you away. After sealing you, he occupied most of our territory and declared himself the Zhuanlun Wang. The underworld king saw that he had not fulfilled their previous agreement, so he led a rebellion, but was defeated and killed. His loyal followers fled to our territory and told us the truth about your imprisonment. However, we were unable to break the seal, and you were forced to sleep for so many years." Yin Luo explained.

"The underworld king is already dead?" Xue Li seemed to feel a sense of regret, saying in a low voice.

"Not just the underworld king, but the ghost witch has also died, both at the hands of the Zhuanlun Wang. Now, the three major domains of the black river, the underworld, and the Yanluo are almost all under his control." Yin Luo continued.

"What...?" Xue Li's eyes narrowed, and he seemed to be shocked.

In the past, the three of them had each controlled one of the three major domains, with Xue Li having the highest combat power, the underworld king being the most skilled at governing, and the ghost witch being the most cunning, with various ruthless methods and exceptional survival skills. It was unexpected that he had also died at the hands of the Zhuanlun Wang.

"Now that I think about it, we were all played by the Zhuanlun Wang. It's no wonder we were so obsessed with the wheel of reincarnation's cultivation secrets, and we fought each other, giving the Zhuanlun Wang the opportunity to intervene. It's only fitting, it's only fitting, haha..." Xue Li's abdomen fluttered uncontrollably, and he burst into loud laughter.
