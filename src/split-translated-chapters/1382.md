"What's going on... Am I going to return to the void, merge with this world?"

"Unexpectedly, since I started on the path of cultivation, I've been cautious and never dared to slack off, but in the end, I couldn't escape this calamity..."

"Compared to those cultivators who fell early on due to various reasons, I've only added a few years to my life..."

"Yan'er, I'm sorry..."

"If there's a next life... I'd rather be an ordinary mortal, without the chance of longevity, but I can still have a family and not have to envy the immortals."

Han Li's thoughts were chaotic, but there was a hint of helplessness and sorrow in them.

At this moment, the surrounding void began to shine with a golden light, which was the power of the time law, rapidly converging towards his body, but the world around him was still extremely slow.

The golden light transformed into five golden torrents, merging into his body.

These five time law powers were extremely familiar to Han Li, and were the five time law powers of the Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique that he had cultivated for many years.

What was lost was regained, and the time law power within him quickly became full, and his five senses were restored.

The five time law powers madly circulated within him, like a raging storm, sweeping away everything.

The incantation of the Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique flowed through his mind, and his understanding of this technique was deeper than ever before.

Han Li felt his body become light and airy, and with a loud "boom", his vision was filled with golden light, as if he had pushed open a door and entered a new realm.

The time law power continued to flow into him, and his body's time quickly reached its previous level, but the time law power converging from the void did not stop, and instead increased.

Five thick golden torrents surged towards him, pouring into his limbs and bones.

The heavenly and earthly energies also rushed towards him, pouring into his body.

Han Li's broken body began to heal rapidly, and his injuries were quickly restored.

A brilliant golden light burst forth from his body, and a powerful aura that was several times stronger than before erupted from him, spreading outwards like a tidal wave.

Almost the entire Middle Realm's heavenly and earthly energies began to fluctuate wildly.

The surrounding world's time flow rate suddenly changed, and returned to normal.

The Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation, the Demon Lord, and Gu Tianyou looked at Han Li's transformation with changing expressions.

From their perspective, this series of events had occurred in the blink of an eye, and Han Li, who had been severely injured and on the verge of death, had suddenly transformed into his current state.

The Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation and the Demon Lord's eyes flashed with excitement.

Although Han Li's transformation was strange, the aura emanating from him was not unfamiliar, and was the sign of a breakthrough to the Daoyuan stage.

Han Li's breakthrough to the Daoyuan stage at this critical moment gave him more confidence in his ability to resist Gu Tianyou.

"This is impossible, Gu Tianyou is still here, how can Han Li possibly become the Time Daoyuan?" the Demon Lord exclaimed in surprise.

"Gu Tianyou has fused with the power of chaos, trying to break through the heavenly law, which is equivalent to giving up the position of Time Daoyuan. Han Li can only smoothly ascend to this position. I think Gu Tianyou did not expect this, it's the will of heaven." The Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation's eyes gleamed with understanding.

The Demon Lord nodded in agreement.

Gu Tianyou looked at Han Li with a dark expression, his eyes flashing with a fierce light, as if he wanted to do something.

"Don't think about it!" The Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation and the Demon Lord appeared, blocking Gu Tianyou's path to Han Li.

Gu Tianyou's brow furrowed, and he and the chaos vortex had merged, increasing his power, but also creating a problem that made it difficult for him to move.

At the same time, the previously bright sky suddenly turned dark, and a large amount of gray and black clouds appeared, covering the entire sky, and emitting a heavy pressure.

This pressure was as heavy as the heavens, and as thick as the earth, and was unstoppable.

"The Daoyuan Great Calamity!" The Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation and the Demon Lord's faces showed concern, but also a hint of joy.

The Daoyuan Great Calamity was a heavenly calamity that one must experience when breaking through to the Daoyuan stage, and was not to be underestimated. A single misstep would result in downfall.

But the Daoyuan Great Calamity had arrived, and the area around Han Li was now a forbidden zone, and any outsider who entered would be attacked by the heavenly calamity, including Gu Tianyou.

"The Daoyuan Great Calamity has arrived quickly, but the time law is the supreme law, and the power of the Daoyuan Great Calamity is far greater than that of other ordinary laws. I had to prepare for a long time, and even then, I only barely passed with a bit of luck. I don't believe you can pass through this calamity, having suddenly broken through to the Daoyuan stage." Gu Tianyou sneered, his expression slightly more stable than before.

At this moment, the sky above had completely turned black, and the area below was also shrouded in darkness, with an aura of killing intent emanating from it.

A loud "hiss" sound filled the air!

The dark clouds in the sky began to churn, forming a massive vortex that was aimed at Han Li.

Han Li looked up at the sky, his expression calm.
Han Li had previously "died" once, and unknowingly, he had thought through some things, and his heart had become much more at ease.

In the vortex, black lightning bolts were racing and roaming, looking exceptionally frightening, and in the center of the vortex, there was a black hole emitting a deep, mysterious glow, connecting to who-knows-where.

Between the flashes of black lightning, a deafening roar erupted, and a terrifying pressure, many times greater than before, emanated from the vortex, causing the surrounding void to violently shake and distort.

Han Li's body was enveloped by this pressure, and he slightly trembled, but immediately stabilized his figure.

In the depths of the vortex, a gray glow flashed, and countless dense gray clouds flew out, covering the sky and pressing down on Han Li.

This gray cloud, he had seen before, was the same as when Crab Daoist had advanced to the Dao Ancestor realm and transcended the Heavenly Dao tribulation.

However, the number of gray clouds that appeared when Crab Daoist transcended the tribulation was not even one-tenth of what Han Li was facing now.

Han Li's mouth curled into a smile.

When he had witnessed Crab Daoist transcending the tribulation, the gray clouds had just appeared, and he had been unable to withstand the pressure, fainting on the spot. Now, as he personally transcended the tribulation, the pressure of the gray clouds was still considerable, but it was nothing to him.

His eyes flashed with a black, mysterious light, and he quickly discovered the true form of the gray clouds, which were composed of extremely fine, gray lightning bolts.

These lightning bolts were incredibly fine, but the power they contained was extremely terrifying, and they also contained a strange, demonic energy that stirred the heart.

Han Li's eyes flashed with a sharp light, and he let out a low shout, punching the air and striking the gray clouds.

Tens of thousands of golden lights burst forth from his fist, resembling a brilliant sun suddenly rising.

The golden lights pierced through the gray clouds, easily tearing them apart.

The gray clouds violently trembled, were pierced through with countless holes, and then, like ice and snow meeting fire, completely collapsed and dispersed.

The power of the lightning was nothing to Han Li. As for the demonic energy, Han Li had long since refined and purified his heart, and the three corpses had been beheaded, allowing him to transcend the threefold heart tribulation. His heart was now impervious to evil!

Seeing Han Li easily transcend the first great tribulation, the Lord of the Reincarnation Hall and the Demon Lord both felt a sense of joy.

"Hmph! The first great tribulation is just an appetizer, the truly difficult ones are still to come." Guo Ou Jin coldly laughed.

As soon as Guo Ou Jin's words fell, the heavenly tribulation clouds in the sky once again violently churned, and the originally black clouds suddenly turned blood-red.

Thick, blood-red lightning bolts rolled within the clouds, weaving together, and vaguely taking the shape of a blood-red lotus flower, emitting a terrifying, world-destroying energy.

"The Red Lotus Divine Lightning!" Han Li's eyebrows twitched.

The Red Lotus Divine Lightning was one of the thirty-six heavenly thunders, ranking extremely high, and its power was extremely terrifying.

Its main effect was not to destroy the physical body, but to annihilate the divine soul, and thus, it was also known as the Soul-Annihilating Divine Lightning.

Furthermore, the Red Lotus Divine Lightning in the heavenly tribulation clouds contained the power of the heavenly tribulation, making it even more powerful than the ordinary Red Lotus Divine Lightning.

Before he could think further, a deafening roar erupted, and the Red Lotus Divine Lightning in the heavenly tribulation clouds finally gathered, forming a massive, mountain-sized lotus flower that descended upon Han Li.

Han Li's face showed no fear, and he spat out a mouthful of air.

A golden light ball flew out from his hand, hovering above his head, and with a swift rotation, it split open, transforming into a massive, golden light shield.

The light shield was extremely crystal-clear, resembling a diamond, and the symbols on it danced, with a sturdy, square-shaped tower pattern at its center. The entire shield gave off an aura of being indestructible.

This was the defensive divine technique of the True Word Sect, the Taiyu Law Shield, which was renowned alongside the Undying Golden Cloud.

A deafening roar erupted as the Red Lotus Divine Lightning struck the Taiyu Law Shield, causing the shield to tremble violently, emitting a series of creaking sounds, and the symbols on it became blurry.

However, the Taiyu Law Shield did not shatter, and it steadily hovered above Han Li's head, withstanding the Red Lotus Divine Lightning's frenzied attacks.

The Red Lotus Divine Lightning did not shatter the shield, but a half-transparent, blood-red lotus shadow suddenly separated from it, piercing through the Taiyu Law Shield and rapidly striking Han Li.

Han Li was not surprised, and with a swift hand seal, a complex, crystal-like symbol appeared on his forehead, emitting a series of crystal-like ripples that enveloped his entire body.

The blood-red lotus shadow struck Han Li's body, but the crystal-like ripples firmly withstood its attack.

After a full quarter of an hour, the blood-red lotus shadow finally shattered, and Han Li, protected by the crystal-like ripples, remained unscathed.

The distant Lord of the Reincarnation Hall and others watched this scene, their expressions varied.

But before they could say anything, the heavenly tribulation clouds in the sky once again changed, suddenly turning golden.

Innumerable, massive golden lightning bolts rolled within the clouds, emitting a series of thunderous, earth-shaking roars, as if they were about to shatter the heavens.

The golden lightning bolts contained an extremely powerful time law, and they were filled with a violent, destructive energy, similar to the time law that Guo Ou Jin had previously used in the shape of lightning.
