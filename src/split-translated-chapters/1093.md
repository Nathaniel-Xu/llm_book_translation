As the blue yuan zi and blue yan duo activated the formation, the blue oil paper umbrella suspended above the altar began to rotate rapidly, and the pool drawn on it was like being hit by a sudden storm, shaking violently.

The edge of the umbrella seemed to have water splashing, almost jumping out of the paper, and the ten or so golden carp in the pool also began to move, swimming on the umbrella's surface, their tails leaving behind golden trails.

As the formation started, the altar began to shake violently, and the golden flame on top of it wavered slightly, but the blue cloth bag on the side reacted much more dramatically.

The bag's body was bulging and shaking violently, and the sound of "rumbling" grew louder, no longer sounding like a river flowing, but like thunder shaking the sky.

Lan Yuanzi heard the sound and exchanged a glance with Lan Yan, both of their expressions were serious, and they couldn't help but feel a bit tense.

Suddenly, a loud "boom" sounded.

The blue cloth bag shook violently, and a blue light flashed from within, eighteen water dragons burst out, charging straight at Lan Yuanzi and Lan Yan.

Each water dragon was over ten meters long, its body crystal clear, like a water crystal, and the water inside was flowing, releasing a powerful water attribute law.

"Be careful..." Lan Yuanzi's eyes narrowed, warning.

As soon as his words fell, the eighteen water dragons crashed into the formation they had set up.

A series of thunderous sounds continued to ring out, and the water dragons' bodies were filled with lightning, countless blue water thunderbolts surging out, constantly bombarding the formation, and the electric threads that shot out enveloped the entire altar.

Lan Yan felt the power and force contained within the water thunder, and her face turned slightly pale.

She secretly stabilized her mind, her hands continuously forming hand seals, coordinating with Lan Yuanzi, sending spiritual energy to the blue oil paper umbrella.

The umbrella's light flashed, and it suddenly expanded several times, the pool drawn on it churning, and the golden carp inside jumped up, leaving behind golden trails.

As the umbrella's strange phenomena appeared, the symbols on the umbrella's handle began to glow brightly, and a series of black whirlpools emerged, releasing a powerful attractive force.

The whirlpools absorbed the blue lightning, and the umbrella's surface was still, the pool's water was boiling, and the golden carp inside were no longer just jumping, but were frantically leaping, their scales flashing with electricity.

As the umbrella continued to absorb, it seemed to have temporarily reached a stalemate with the water dragons, and the altar's surroundings were still filled with the power of the water thunder.

"It seems we can only control it to this extent, if we continue to stalemate, the Jin Yu umbrella might not be able to withstand it, since we've reached this point, we have to take a risk..." Lan Yuanzi's expression was serious.

"Alright!" Lan Yan's face was pale, and she nodded.

The two of them simultaneously closed their eyes, sat down in a cross-legged position, and formed a strange hand seal, their bodies releasing a powerful water attribute law.

As they changed, the two layers of spiritual domain light screens surrounding them produced thin threads, connecting and pulling each other, and finally, the light merged into one.

At the same time, a blue light flashed on Lan Yuanzi and Lan Yan's foreheads, and two tiny yuan babies emerged, flying to the center of the two, their hands clasped, and their bodies glowing brightly, merging into one.

The merged yuan baby's body rapidly expanded, becoming almost human-sized, but its face was slightly blurry, making it difficult to distinguish its sex.

Suddenly, the merged spiritual domain released a powerful water attribute law, enveloping the transparent merged yuan baby, forming a strange blue water armor.

The water armor was attached to the merged yuan baby's body, and its aura surged, looking back at the two physical bodies still sitting on the ground, it took a step forward, and its body instantly appeared at the edge of the altar.

It saw the two hands enter the lightning-filled curtain, and with a split, the water thunder was like a curtain, opening up a hole.

The merged yuan baby bent down, entering the hole.

As soon as it entered the altar's range, the eighteen water dragons immediately raised their heads, charging towards it.

The merged yuan baby saw this, its hands forming a strange seal, and with a push, a half-person-high circular water shield appeared in front of it, blocking the water dragons' attack.

A loud "boom" sounded, and the eighteen water dragons crashed into the water shield, splashing out large amounts of blue water thunder.
The sound of crackling electricity filled the air as countless bolts of lightning struck the Yuanying, despite being separated by the water armor. The Yuanying's face contorted in agony, clearly in immense pain.

However, the Fused Yuanying refused to retreat, inching closer to the altar with each passing moment.

The thunderous roar grew louder, and the water lightning became increasingly violent, causing the water armor to begin dissolving. The intricate symbols etched onto the armor's surface began to blur and fade.

At the same time, the oil-paper umbrella above began to mist, releasing a massive amount of water vapor. The water pool painted on the umbrella's surface became increasingly shallow, and the dozen or so golden fish began to disappear, with seven or eight of them vanishing into thin air.

The Fused Yuanying's face twisted in agony, on the verge of collapse, as it finally reached the altar.

"Ah..." The Yuanying let out a mighty roar, and in the moment before it was about to collapse, it grasped the blue cloth bag.

With a sudden yank, the bag was pulled back, and the eighteen lightning water dragons that had emerged from it retreated, transforming into a pool of water that fell back into the bag. The blue light on the bag's surface flashed once, and all sound ceased.

At the same time, the oil-paper umbrella above the altar finally gave way, its surface cracking and crumbling as the water pool painted on it completely dried up. The golden fish had all disappeared, and the umbrella's surface resembled parched, wrinkled skin.

As the last of the umbrella's spiritual energy dissipated, the surface erupted in a fierce blaze, burning to ashes.

The Fused Yuanying retreated from the altar, and its body flashed with blue light as it transformed back into two small Yuanying, which flew back to Lan Yuanzi and Lan Yan.

The two sat cross-legged on the ground, their eyes snapping open as they let out a deep breath.

Lan Yan held the blue cloth bag, gazing at Lan Yuanzi with an expression of joy.

Just as Lan Yuanzi was about to speak, the altar began to shake violently, its surface cracking and splitting like a spider's web. The two quickly stood up, Lan Yuanzi grasping Lan Yan's hand as they retreated from the altar, flying out of the grand hall and back onto the mist-shrouded square.

As they descended, they noticed the mist on the square beginning to dissipate, gradually clearing away.

At that moment, the people on the square, who had been trapped in the illusion, suddenly felt their pain intensify before their eyes snapped open, and they awakened from their trance-like state.

Han Li, who had just escaped the suffocating feeling, took a few deep breaths and looked around, his gaze falling upon the blue grand hall, which was shaking violently, and the Lan siblings, who were descending from the sky.

He furrowed his brow, puzzled, and just then, a loud rumble shook the ground. The black crack that had appeared on the ground began to expand, splitting the mountain cliff in two.

"Ah no..." Lei Yushi's voice echoed through the air as he leapt into the air, attempting to fly towards the grand hall.

However, the black crack expanded rapidly, and the grand hall was torn in two, collapsing in both directions.

Through the crack, Han Li saw the altar, which was still intact, with a lone golden flame hovering above it. The flame danced and flickered, as if it might extinguish itself at any moment.

Han Li's thoughts moved swiftly, and the Great Five Elements Illusory Realm Technique within him began to rotate, drawing upon the power of time to manipulate the flame. He raised his hand, and the flame shot out from the altar, circling his palm before being absorbed into his body.

The altar, which had been on the verge of collapse, finally lost all its restrictive power, and with a deafening crash, it crumbled into the depths of the black hole.

A massive, dark pit had formed, and the remnants of the altar fell into its depths, silence following.

"Too late, too late..." Lei Yushi's voice was laced with regret as he muttered to himself.

His words were cut short by a chorus of eerie, piercing cries that echoed from the depths of the pit.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he sensed the presence of numerous powerful auras rising from the pit, growing stronger by the second.

"Hear the old man, you've suppressed me for so long, but I've finally broken free, haha..." A sharp, sinister voice echoed from the depths of the pit, filled with malice and hatred.
