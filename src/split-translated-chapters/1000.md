With the sound of "later will have no chance" accompanying, a white light flew out, under the protection of a spatial law, it pierced through the big array, and hit his body.

Han Li was shocked, only had time to lower his head to take a glance, and found that it was a marked jade ring, but he didn't have time to react, a strong tearing sensation surged in from all directions.

He felt the air around him tighten, and then a twisting force surged towards him from all directions, making him feel like his body was about to be torn into pieces, his powerful divine sense was also somewhat scattered, and he couldn't concentrate at all.

There was a loud explosion.

The entire Void Tower shook violently, a silver light shot out from the top of the tower, and violently rubbed against the void clouds, creating a dazzling display of colorful light.

At the same time, the silver light on the surface of the rhombus-shaped crystal stones on the outer wall of the tower suddenly exploded, turning into a wave of invisible energy that swept in all directions.

The silver light shot out for a few breaths, and then suddenly dimmed, and the sound stopped.

The entire Void Tower was filled with smoke and dust, the rhombus-shaped crystal stones on the outer wall were mostly destroyed, and the remaining ones were dull and dim, it was clear that the energy they contained was almost exhausted.

A moment later, Shi Po Kong and his group walked out of the tower.

His face was still not looking good, his eyebrows were slightly furrowed, as if he was thinking about something, but his eyes had a few more relaxed expressions than before.

...

In the immortal realm, a place surrounded by green mountains, a ancient Taoist temple was built.

The temple's buildings were built according to the terrain, stretching for dozens of miles.

In a slightly lower valley, there was a white stone formation, surrounded by stone pillars, and dense talismans were carved everywhere.

At this moment, nearly a hundred cultivators, dressed in two different uniforms, were gathered around the formation, their faces serious and solemn.

Among them, there were two leaders, one was a middle-aged man wearing a white robe, his body was not too tall, but his aura was very powerful, and he looked like a person who was used to holding power.

The other was an old man with a thin and long body, his cheeks were sunken, and his beard was sparse, making him look somewhat withered.

"Ta Ji, brother, where did you get this information from, is the person really going to come here today?" the old man suddenly asked, breaking the silence.

"Jin Chuan, brother, yesterday night I suddenly received a cross-border message, saying that the killer of Yu Er would appear on the transmission platform of the Returning Dragon Temple today. Time was too tight, I didn't have time to verify the authenticity, and I hurriedly brought some of my subordinates who could be mobilized, and came here. I thought you were not far away, so I bothered you to come and help." Ta Ji said.

"No problem. But if I'm not mistaken, the person who killed Yu Er back then was just a True Immortal, a small person who could be crushed with just one finger, why are you making such a big fuss?" Jin Chuan asked in doubt.

"This matter is somewhat strange, the person who sent the message said that the person's strength is not bad, and I should treat him as a Tai Yi realm cultivator..." Ta Ji hesitated for a moment before saying.

"This is impossible! How many years has it been since Yu Er was killed? Even if someone is a genius, it's impossible to cross from the True Immortal realm to the Tai Yi realm in such a short time. It's definitely not possible. If I were to say, it's probably someone setting a trap for you, you've offended many people in your position over the years." Jin Chuan shook his head and said.

"Jin Chuan, brother, you also know how much thought I've put into this matter, even if there's only a slight chance, I don't want to miss it. Besides, even if someone is setting a trap for me, with you here to help, what do I have to fear?" Ta Ji sighed and said seriously.

"Don't mention having me help, I think that even if I didn't come, with your current lineup, as long as it's not a Da Luo realm expert, no one would be able to take advantage of you." Jin Chuan swept his eyes around the white stone formation and smiled.

"I only have five Golden Immortal peak cultivators from the Immortal Palace, and over 40 Golden Immortal mid-to-late stage cultivators, if it weren't for your people coming to supplement, and setting up this complete Yin Yang array, I'm afraid the power wouldn't be able to reach its best." Ta Ji smiled bitterly and said.

"Earlier, I heard you say that this person cultivates the power of time laws, it's really quite reckless." Jin Chuan suddenly thought of something and said.

"Probably because he's from a humble background, without a large sect's background, he doesn't know the secrets of law cultivation, and blindly walked onto this path of no return. But he was able to kill Yu Er with his True Immortal cultivation, and then kill Gong Shu Jiu, it's clear that he has already achieved some level of proficiency in his cultivation of time laws." Ta Ji said thoughtfully.

"Haha... even if he has achieved some level of proficiency in time laws, as long as he enters this Yin Yang array, he won't be able to use his power, and will be at our mercy. Don't worry, today he won't come, but if he does, we'll let him know that he's flown into a trap, and avenge Yu Er's blood debt!" Jin Chuan laughed.

Ta Ji's expression relaxed a bit, and he was about to speak when his expression suddenly changed.

"He's here..." Jin Chuan's expression moved, and he smiled.

As soon as he finished speaking, the void above suddenly violently churned, and the clouds gathered above the valley, blocking out half of the sky.

The valley suddenly darkened, and a loud whistling sound rose, and the crowd looked up at the sky.

The clouds above churned violently, and the air was filled with an intense energy, as if something was about to descend from the sky.
"Set up the formation." Tao Ji's expression turned solemn, and he gave a low order.

The nine leading Golden Immortal peak cultivators immediately responded, each leading nine Golden Immortal mid-to-late stage cultivators to move around the transmission platform, searching for their own positions to guard the formation's nodes. They wove a complex large formation together.

The ninety people simultaneously used their hands to seal their techniques, recited incantations, and the ground and the stone pillars around them emitted symbol lights. A layer of black and white glow slowly enveloped the surroundings, like a large mouth waiting to swallow its prey.

A loud rumbling sound shook the air!

Above the transmission platform, a burst of electricity exploded from the gathering dark clouds, and a strong spatial fluctuation spread out. A silver light column tore through the void, emitting a dazzling seven-colored light, and descended straight down.

The transmission platform shook violently as the silver light landed, and a blue figure appeared - it was Han Li.

As the silver light dissipated, a humming sound came from above, and the black and white glow closed in instantly, like a large pot being overturned. The entire transmission platform was enveloped.

The spatial tearing force accompanying the inter-domain transmission was extremely terrifying. Only a Taiyi cultivator would dare to attempt it. If a Golden Immortal cultivator forced it, they would likely suffer severe injuries or even death.

Han Li's physical body was exceptionally strong, so he wouldn't suffer from tearing damage. However, he still felt his head spinning, his body aching, and it was difficult to stand up immediately.

The refining technique in his mind had automatically activated, and after a moment, he recovered his calm.

As he stood up straight, a thumb-sized jade ring fell from his side with a crisp sound.

Han Li shook his head, picked up the jade ring, and looked around. Seeing that half of the people setting up the formation were wearing clothes with the mark of the Heavenly Palace, he couldn't help but sigh:

"Stone Breaker, it seems you've set me up again..."

On the other side, Jing Chuan glanced at Han Li and thought he looked ordinary. He asked:

"Is it him?"

Tao Ji's eyes locked onto Han Li, and he nodded affirmatively.

Although he had never seen Han Li before, he felt a strange sense of recognition when he saw him. He instinctively knew that this person was the one who had killed his child.

"Should I call you Lei Feiyu or Han Li?" Tao Ji asked coldly.

Han Li had already guessed that something might go wrong when he heard Stone Breaker's parting words, but he hadn't expected it to be like this.

"Have we met before?" Han Li asked, furrowing his brow.

"You haven't seen me, but you've seen Yu'er, and you killed him." Tao Ji said coldly.

Han Li examined the middle-aged man carefully and found that his eyes and eyebrows seemed familiar. After a moment, he realized:

"You're Tao Yu's father, the Tao Long that Gong Shujiu mentioned?"

Tao Ji nodded, his expression unchanging.

"You've found the right person, so today is the day you pay your debt in blood. Take action."

The transmission platform shook violently, and the air seemed to be sucked dry. Han Li's brow furrowed as he discovered that the heavenly spiritual energy in the surrounding air had vanished in an instant, making it seem like he had returned to the Accumulated Scale Realm.

He thought about it and couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions, his face showing a hint of helplessness.

"Activate the Yin-Yang Extreme Stone." Tao Ji ordered, his brow slightly furrowed.

As soon as he spoke, the Golden Immortal cultivators changed their techniques, and their hands pushed forward simultaneously.

The symbol lights on the formation's edges suddenly appeared, and the black and white glow seemed to be attracted to them, separating into two distinct parts. The white light moved to the left, and the black light moved to the right, condensing onto the symbol lights and transforming into two massive black and white millstones. They rotated fiercely, pressing towards the center.

Han Li stood at the center, feeling the crushing force from the millstones even before they touched him. The air around him seemed to compress, forming two invisible walls of air that locked him in place, making it impossible for him to move.
