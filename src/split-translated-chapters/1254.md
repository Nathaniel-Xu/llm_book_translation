As the ancient mirror shattered, the black-clad woman's face turned red, and she spat out a small mouthful of blood. Her complexion suddenly turned deathly pale, as if the destruction of her life-bound artifact had caused her physical body to suffer.

However, she didn't even glance at the shattered mirror. Instead, she swiftly extended her right hand.

A dark red glow shot out from her palm, and she grasped the five-colored small bottle, holding it tightly in her hand.

Chi Meng and Huo Yuan witnessed this scene, and both of them burst into anger. Their bodies surged with energy, and they simultaneously snapped their fingers.

The nine fire dragons and over a hundred bolts of lightning flashed brightly, their speed increasing exponentially as they descended, encircling the black-clad woman from all sides. A massive pressure descended upon her, and she fell to the ground with a thud, her body "plop" landing on the floor. However, her right hand still clutched the five-colored small bottle tightly.

The three of them had clashed in a complex manner, but in reality, it was all over in the blink of an eye.

At this moment, the pure and refined Pure Jun True Person, Shi Kongmo, Wu Yang, and others, who had been knocked into the walls of the great hall, finally regained their breath and looked towards the five-colored small bottle.

Seeing the black-clad woman in a desperate situation, Wu Yang and Jiao San's faces changed dramatically.

The two of them disregarded their own injuries and transformed into two flashes of light, dashing towards the entrance. They seemed determined to rescue the black-clad woman at all costs.

Unfortunately, they were too far away, and it was already too late.

The black-clad woman's bamboo hat had been blown away, and her face veil had disappeared, revealing a stunning, lively, and beautiful young girl's face.

She struggled to lift her head, gazing towards the terrifying attacks that were flying towards her from all sides. A hint of despair appeared on her face.

But just as she was about to be overwhelmed, the air around her began to fluctuate, and a figure suddenly appeared â€“ it was Han Li.

He swept his sleeve, and a golden glow shot out from his sleeve, flashing towards the black-clad woman's head.

With a "whoosh" sound, the golden glow expanded, transforming into a dense, thick, and solid golden cloud. The golden cloud was filled with countless symbols that danced and emitted a series of melodious, chanting sounds, enveloping Han Li and the black-clad woman within.

"This is...?" Wu Yang saw the golden cloud, and his face changed. He paused momentarily in his flight.

Pure Jun True Person's expression also changed upon witnessing this scene.

The fire dragons and lightning bolts descended like rain, engulfing the golden cloud.

A deafening roar erupted, filled with the sounds of thunder, flames, and dragon roars.

The flames rolled and the lightning flashed, and the air within a radius of several dozen feet shattered, creating a multitude of spatial rifts that crisscrossed and cut through the air. The spiritual energy of the heavens and earth surged violently, as if it was about to collapse.

The entire great hall shook violently, and the ground and surrounding walls glowed with a golden light, as if they were about to collapse under the intense pressure.

After a while, the turbulent flames and lightning finally subsided, and the shattered air quickly mended itself, revealing the scene within.

The golden cloud seemed to have been shaved off by a layer, but it still stood firm, its surface radiating dazzling golden light, without any signs of damage.

Chi Meng and Huo Yuan witnessed this scene, and their faces revealed their incredulity.

Their previous attack had seemed ordinary, but in reality, it was already their full strength. Yet, they hadn't been able to break through the thin layer of golden cloud.

Just then, two sharp, piercing sounds echoed through the air, and two beams of golden light shot out, slashing towards Chi Meng and Huo Yuan.

The two of them changed their expressions, hastily retreating to avoid the golden light's slash.

The golden light didn't pursue them, instead, it immediately retreated, disappearing into Wu Yang's sleeve.

Wu Yang's body moved, landing near the golden cloud.

A series of swift, swooshing sounds followed, as Jiao San, Lu Chuanfeng, and even Shi Kongmo flew towards the golden cloud, gathering around it and protecting it.

The golden cloud fluctuated, and with a "whoosh" sound, it expanded, revealing Han Li and the black-clad woman within.

Han Li waved his hand, retracting the golden cloud, and ignored the others, gazing intently at the black-clad woman.

"Wan'er..." He had always maintained his calm demeanor, but now it had completely disappeared from his face. He had become infatuated, his lips moving slightly as he whispered her name.

This face, which had haunted his dreams for so long, had finally reappeared before him. It seemed that not a single day had passed since their first meeting.

Only, there was a hint of celestial energy, and her beauty was even more enchanting, more heartbreaking.

Han Li's mind was now empty, devoid of any thoughts of cultivation, realms, techniques, or incantations. His eyes only saw the delicate, weak girl before him, and he yearned to hold her in his arms, to protect her. But he feared that if he touched her, she would vanish, leaving him with nothing but a dream.

A previously unknown emotion flooded Han Li's heart, and his mental state reached a new level.

A faint sound echoed, and a certain bottleneck shattered, allowing Han Li's mental state to reach a new realm.
Ruxue? You're referring to me? Thank you, sir, for rescuing me, but my name is Rushuang, not Ruxue. The black-clad woman raised an eyebrow and stood up, her expression cold and detached.

As she spoke, she took out a red pill and swallowed it, and a warm glow flashed on her face, restoring some of her vitality.

Rushuang... Han Li's body shook, and his expression returned to normal, but he stood there in a daze.

Han fellow, thank you for saving Rushuang, but how did you end up here? Jiao San asked, his eyes flashing with surprise.

Han Li glanced at Jiao San, but didn't respond, his gaze turning back to the black-clad girl.

The black-clad girl scrunched up her nose and dodged behind Wu Yang, avoiding Han Li's gaze.

Han Li's heart ached, and his eyes turned cold as he looked at Wu Yang, his fists clenched involuntarily.

He and Wan'er had been married for many years, and their hearts were connected, so he couldn't be mistaken. This black-clad girl was definitely his wife, Nangong Wan'er.

Although there were many doubts about this, such as why Nangong Wan'er was here, and how she had become a member of the Wheel of Reincarnation, and how her cultivation had reached the Great Luo Realm, Han Li trusted his instincts.

We're not here to chat, now that we have the item, let's retreat immediately! Wu Yang noticed Han Li's gaze and frowned, then immediately said.

But before he finished speaking, a loud, muffled sound echoed through the hall, and the main gate slammed shut, trapping everyone inside.

The expressions of the people in the hall changed.

Chi Meng, who was closest to the gate, immediately raised her hand and cast a spell.

A sword-shaped flame shot out, carrying the power of the fire law, and struck the gate.

A loud explosion shook the hall, and the flame burst into a red mushroom cloud, which quickly dissipated.

The gate was unscathed, without a single mark.

Chi Meng's face fell.

The gate has been sealed by the ancestor's personal spell, and it will take some time to activate it. But we've made it just in time. A cold laugh echoed from the side, and Chun Jun walked over, his face expressionless, his eyes scanning the crowd.

Yang Junzi and Lei Junzi stood behind him, each holding a golden token, and they were activating the spell.

The tokens emitted a golden glow, which spread outwards, enveloping the entire hall.

A low hum filled the air, and a layer of golden light, like crystal, covered the hall.

Han Li had regained his composure, and his face changed as he looked around.

He had sensed that the hall was surrounded by an invisible force, which had affected the operation of the law.

Wu Yang and the others had been fighting on a small scale, and their cultivation was not commensurate with their Great Luo Realm status. They had only been able to expand their spiritual domain a few dozen feet, probably due to this reason.

Now, the golden light had strengthened this invisible force, making it even harder for them to escape.

Wu Yang and the others looked worried, except for Shi Kongmo, who seemed calm and collected, examining the golden light with interest.

Chun Jun looked at the Wheel of Reincarnation group, his gaze lingering on Han Li for a moment before moving on to Lu Chuanfeng.

Lu Chuanfeng, what benefits did the Wheel of Reincarnation offer you, that you would betray the Heavenly Court and kill the Phoenix Heaven Envoy? Chun Jun's eyes flashed with confusion, and he asked in a deep voice.

I apologize, but I'm not in league with them. I'm actually a member of the Wheel of Reincarnation. Lu Chuanfeng smiled slightly and said.

I didn't expect... The Wheel of Reincarnation's reach is longer than I thought. Since you're a mole, you won't be leaving this place alive today! Chun Jun's expression changed, and he said coldly.

Please, Chun Jun, you're welcome to take my life whenever you want. Lu Chuanfeng laughed and said.

Chun Jun snorted and ignored him, turning his gaze to Chi Meng and Huo Yuan.

Chi Meng, Huo Yuan, you two sneaked into my Nine Yuan Observatory, stealing our treasures. What's the meaning of this? Are you also in league with the Wheel of Reincarnation? Chun Jun's voice was cold and detached.

Please, don't misunderstand, Chun Jun. The Wheel of Reincarnation is evil, and I and Huo Yuan would never collaborate with them. We intervened because we saw the treasure bottle was about to fall into the Wheel of Reincarnation's hands. We didn't mean to steal your observatory's treasures. Chi Meng's eyes sparkled, and she smiled slightly.
