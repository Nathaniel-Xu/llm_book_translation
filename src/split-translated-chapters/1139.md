The Golden Spring City was vast and sprawling, with countless people entering and exiting the city every day. In addition to the city gate, there were many entrances on the city's defensive barriers, making it convenient for cultivators to come and go.

Han Li and his companion flew into the city from a mid-air entrance, and they saw that the city was filled with people, with many cultivators flying about. The city's streets were wide and clean, with many large shops and buildings that seemed to be a far cry from the mundane world.

Some of the larger shops were even built in mid-air, giving off an otherworldly aura. Han Li recognized some of the shops as belonging to powerful factions, such as the Bai Zao Mountain and the Sheng Long Temple. He even saw a shop belonging to the demonic realm, the Guang Yuan Zhai.

If he had come here before, Han Li might have been interested in browsing the shops, but now his mind was preoccupied with the news of the Golden Boy's capture. He ignored the shops and flew straight to the city center.

After a few breaths, a golden tower appeared in front of him, floating in mid-air. The tower was the location of the inter-domain transmission array that connected the Golden Spring Domain to the larger domain.

The tower's entrance was closed, and the square in front of it was empty and quiet. Han Li and his companion landed on the square, and Han Li's eyes scanned the area, noticing that several divine senses had swept over them.

"What's going on?" Han Li's companion, Lan Yan, asked, noticing the strange atmosphere. "When we came here before, this place was bustling with people. Why is it so empty now?"

Han Li's brow furrowed, not just because of the situation, but also because he had detected several divine senses that had swept over them. He was about to investigate when he suddenly stopped, his expression calm as he walked towards the tower.

Two golden-armored guards stood at the entrance, their cultivation at the Golden Immortal level. Han Li couldn't help but feel that the Golden Spring Domain was much more prosperous than the smaller domains he had visited before.

"What brings you two here?" one of the guards asked, his expression neutral.

Han Li and Lan Yan had suppressed their cultivation to the Golden Immortal level to avoid drawing attention. "We want to use the inter-domain transmission array to go to the larger Golden Spring Domain," Han Li said with a smile.

"I'm afraid that's not possible," the guard replied. "The transmission array has been malfunctioning for some time and is currently closed. You'll have to come back another day."

Han Li's eyes narrowed. "What's wrong with the transmission array?"

The guard shrugged. "We're not sure. When it's fixed, we'll make an announcement. You can check the news on the Celestial Stacks."

Han Li's mind was racing as he thanked the guard and flew towards the Celestial Stacks, a large building floating in mid-air. Lan Yan followed quietly behind him.

 Inside the golden tower, four cultivators in golden robes sat in a large hall, each with a small white orb floating in front of them. The orbs displayed the images of Han Li and Lan Yan, who were now flying towards the Celestial Stacks.

The cultivators were all from the Heavenly Court, and they seemed to be monitoring the situation. "According to our information, the target's divine sense is extremely powerful," one of them said. "We can't let our guard down."

Another cultivator nodded. "It's been over a decade since we lost track of Han Li. I wonder if he's found another way to leave the Golden Spring Domain."

A third cultivator, a gray-haired old man, looked at the others. "Don't worry, we'll find him eventually. We just need to be patient."

The others nodded in agreement, their eyes fixed on the orbs as they continued to monitor the situation.
The other three nodded in agreement, focusing their attention on the white orbs in their hands.

Just then, the round-faced middle-aged man's brow furrowed, and he let out a low hum. The white orb in front of him also flickered erratically.

"What's wrong, Brother Liang?" the eagle-nosed man asked, looking over.

"It's nothing, just that controlling the Turning Wheel Orb is exhausting for my divine sense. In the past, I was injured during a mission, and my divine sense was damaged. I'm having trouble supporting it," the round-faced middle-aged man said with a hint of embarrassment.

The eagle-nosed man's brow furrowed slightly as he sensed the fluctuations in the round-faced middle-aged man's divine sense. It was weak and unstable.

"Since Brother Liang is injured, why don't you take a rest first? We have half a day before our shift changes, and the three of us can handle the investigation," the gray-haired old man said, lifting his eyelids.

"Four people investigating is not much different from three people investigating," the middle-aged woman added.

The round-faced middle-aged man gave them a grateful glance before looking at the eagle-nosed man.

"Since Brothers Tian and Liu have said so, Brother Liang should take a rest first and focus on recovering. I hope this situation doesn't happen again in the future," the eagle-nosed man said after a moment of consideration.

"Yes," the round-faced middle-aged man replied, putting away the white orb and leaving.

...

At this moment, Han Li and Blue Color were mixed in with the crowd, entering the Immortal's Stair.

He didn't know that his caution had allowed him to avoid a danger.

The Immortal's Stair was much larger than those in other immortal realms, but the layout was similar.

On either side of the stair were shops selling various elixirs, immortal artifacts, and spiritual materials, all of high quality, attracting many cultivators.

In the center of the stair, a massive blue stone wall stood, covered in task postings. This was the Task Stone Wall of the Immortal's Stair.

Behind the Task Stone Wall, a platform stood, also over a thousand feet tall, with a massive banner hanging from it. The banner was filled with various figures, and it was the Heavenly Extermination List.

The area around the Task Stone Wall and the Heavenly Extermination List was crowded with people, their faces filled with excitement, as if they had seen something thrilling.

Han Li's heart stirred, and he swept his gaze over the Task Stone Wall and the Heavenly Extermination List. His face changed.

He saw that his ranking on the Heavenly Extermination List had skyrocketed, almost reaching the top ten, and his name had been changed to Han Li.

The description of his crimes had also been added to: Han Li, member of the Turning Wheel Temple, cultivator of forbidden techniques, participant in the assassination of the North Cold Immortal Palace's Palace Master Xiao Jincheng, the Golden Source Immortal Palace's Palace Master Dongfang Bai, collaborator with the Demon Realm, destroyer of the Golden Source Mountain's spiritual vein roots, causing the mountain's collapse and the suffering of countless living beings. Death is not a concern, reward of 50 million Immortal Yuan Stones!

The Task Stone Wall also had a task posted by the Heavenly Court, to capture Han Li, detailing his various abilities, such as his possession of the Thunder Attribute's Blue Bamboo Bee Cloud Sword, his body bearing demonic energy, his ability to use the Demon Realm's Nine-Yin Demon Eye, his transformation into a Heavenly Demon, and his mastery of the Time Law.

The task also mentioned that Han Li was currently in the Golden Source Immortal Realm, and that even if he couldn't be caught, anyone providing information about him would receive a generous reward.

Jiao San, Huo San, and others who had participated in the Taichang Immortal Palace's incident didn't have any changes in their situation on the Heavenly Extermination List, and there were no tasks to capture them on the Immortal's Stair. It seemed that all the attention was focused on Han Li.

"Who is this Han Li, that the Heavenly Court is offering a reward of 50 million Immortal Yuan Stones for his capture? Ah, it's been a long time since the Heavenly Extermination List has seen such a large reward!"

"50 million Immortal Yuan Stones! With that kind of reward, I'd find a secluded spot to cultivate for a thousand years, and I wouldn't emerge until I reached the Taiyi Realm!"

"Ha! You're just a small fry, with that kind of reward, you'd be better off finding a spiritual vein to establish a sect and become a sect leader!"

"Those who can make it onto the Heavenly Extermination List are not people we can touch. Don't get too greedy, or you'll end up losing your life!"

"Hehe, Brother Qin is right, Immortal Yuan Stones are great, but you need to have a life to spend them."

"Ah, it's true, why bother with this? Let's just watch the excitement and leave it to others."

"This Han Li is clearly a ruthless character, a true fiend. We're just minor cultivators, let's not get involved."

"You didn't see it? He's a member of the Turning Wheel Temple, and the Golden Source Mountain's collapse was caused by his collaboration with the Demon Realm!"

"The Golden Source Mountain's collapse was a disaster, countless ordinary people and sects were destroyed. This person's crimes are truly heinous!"

The crowd around them was abuzz with discussion and criticism, with some people taking out their communication devices to contact their sects and inform them of Han Li's existence.

Some people even began to secretly investigate the surrounding area, as the reward of 50 million Immortal Yuan Stones was too enticing.
