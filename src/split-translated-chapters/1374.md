The gigantic wave that had been split apart by the dark purple blade and black light column suddenly dispersed, but the next moment, the splashing waves gathered again, forming a new wave that was even more powerful than before.

The dark purple blade and black light column initially seemed to be unstoppable, splitting apart wave after wave, but these waves were quickly restored to their original state, and their power became even more astonishing.

The evil and charming woman and the lion-headed giant beast continued to strike with their blades and shoot out light columns, but they were ultimately unable to withstand the endless waves, and all their attacks were completely engulfed by a massive wave that blocked out the sun.

This series of changes happened in the blink of an eye.

The massive wave swallowed up the two people's attacks, and without stopping, it fiercely crashed into the evil and charming woman and the lion-headed giant beast, unleashing a boundless and indescribable power that sent the two flying.

The evil and charming woman and the white-robed fat woman, who had transformed into a giant beast, quickly stabilized their bodies and were about to attack again, but Chen Ruyan suddenly moved, transforming into a wisp of blue smoke that escaped from the battlefield and appeared a hundred miles away.

"My fellow dao friends, is it really necessary to determine the outcome of this battle between us? Why don't we conserve our energy and see how things turn out on the other side?" Chen Ruyan smiled faintly and said.

"Don't think about it!"

The evil and charming woman's eyes were filled with envy and hatred, and she was unwilling to stop, raising her dark purple long knife once again.

"Helan, what she said isn't without reason. Let's stop for now and wait for the outcome on the other side before deciding what to do." The lion-headed giant beast's body flashed with light, and it transformed back into the white-robed fat woman, stretching out her hand to block the evil and charming woman, who was called "Helan".

Helan's face changed several times, and she reluctantly put down her long knife.

However, the two women's eyes remained fixed on Chen Ruyan, preventing her from escaping.

Chen Ruyan saw through their intentions and smiled faintly, not making any suspicious movements, standing still and gazing into the distance at the demon master and the others.

Almost at the same time that the battle on Chen Ruyan's side stopped, the Yin Ming Dao Zu also suddenly retreated.

"I say, fellow dao friends, the good show on the other side is about to begin. This is a rare sight that appears only once in ten thousand years, don't you want to take a look?" A low, muffled voice sounded, and this was the first time the Yin Ming Dao Zu had spoken.

The dried-up corpse and the yellow-robed man exchanged a glance, and although they didn't say anything, they also didn't attack.

Unlike the situation on Chen Ruyan's side, the battle between the six people, including Bai Ze and Bai Yun Dao Zu, not only didn't stop, but became even more intense.

Seeing that Guo Huo was surrounded by seven people, Bai Yun Dao Zu and the others were anxious to break free and go to his aid, and they naturally used all their strength to unleash their techniques, with various laws, spiritual domains, and treasures intersecting and colliding.

Bai Ze and the others, who had the upper hand, naturally wouldn't let them escape, and they also used all their strength to block them.

At this moment, the three people had all transformed into their true forms.

Bai Ze transformed into a white, auspicious beast with two horns and a beard like a goat, and its mouth opened and closed, spewing out countless white windstorms.

Yue Mian transformed into a massive, heavenly Peng bird, with countless lightning bolts surrounding its body, and wherever it passed, the area was filled with lightning.

The bald, burly man transformed into a massive, black, fish-like beast that was as big as a mountain, its body larger than Bai Ze and Yue Mian by more than half.

The beast's face was ugly, especially its enormous mouth, which occupied half of its head.

Its dark, cavernous mouth was filled with sharp teeth, and it seemed to be connected to another world, emitting a powerful suction force.

Everything that came before it was swallowed up, and sometimes it would even pull in large areas of empty space.

Although the six people were all at the Dao Zu level, with similar law and power, Bai Ze and the others were true spirits, with incredibly strong physical foundations, and no matter how fiercely Bai Yun Dao Zu and the others attacked, they couldn't gain the upper hand.

"Do you want to kill me?" Guo Huo looked around at the seven people surrounding him, his face expressionless, and asked in a casual tone.

"You're to blame for being too greedy," the demon master said, his eyes fixed on Guo Huo, and he sneered.

"Greedy? I just want to see the end of this world, what's there to be greedy about? You've all reached this level of cultivation, don't you have any desires or obsessions?" Guo Huo said faintly, his hand hidden in his sleeve, and he crushed the ring he was wearing without making a sound.

"Guo Huo is cunning and ruthless, don't let him use any more tricks to delay us, let's attack together!" The master of the Wheel of Rebirth said, his eyes narrowing as if he had discovered something, and he struck at Guo Huo with his palm.

A ghostly figure appeared in the air, its body a dark red color, wearing a bone-like armor, and a Wheel of Rebirth law surrounded it, constantly changing and emitting a loud, thunderous sound, as if it was fiercely roaring.

The ghostly figure also struck at Guo Huo's head with its palm, instantly tearing apart time and space.

The demon master and the others saw the master of the Wheel of Rebirth attack, and they immediately joined in.

"Space shattered!"

"Golden Emperor splits the sky!"

"Fire God descends!"

"Phantom destruction!"

"Overlord starry sky!"
"Soul Devouring, Spirit Consuming!"

The six strongest laws of the six Dao Ancestors converged, unleashing their most powerful attacks at Guo Huinian.

In an instant, the void within a million miles was shaken, the void cracked and shattered, and the golden light of the heavenly flame, the black shadow of the formless substance, and the dazzling starlight tore through the sky, churning the world into a maelstrom.

Everyone in the Yaochi, including the demon and devil armies, had already fled to a distance of a million miles, and those with weaker cultivation were instantly annihilated by the torrent of laws, their spirits and bodies destroyed.

As everyone's hearts were shaken, they dared not approach, only watching from a distance.

The ultimate showdown between the Dao Ancestors had finally begun. As the Time Dao Ancestor, Guo Huinian was the leader of the Seven Heavenly Kings, and had indulged in the Time Law for countless years, making him the strongest in the world.

The seven people surrounding Guo Huinian, including the Wheel of Reincarnation Master and the Devil Master, were the only ones who had cultivated the other two laws to the extreme, and although they were not as powerful as Guo Huinian, they could still contend with him on the level of laws.

The other five people were also not to be underestimated, for they had cultivated laws that, although not as powerful as the three supreme laws, were still formidable.

After all, the three thousand great paths of the world encompassed all the rules of the world, and cultivating any one of these laws to the extreme would allow one to grasp the true essence of the Dao.

Although the five laws were originally unable to contend with the Time Law, now that they had joined forces with the Wheel of Reincarnation and Space, the seven laws had gained the ability to rival the supreme Time Law.

Everyone held their breath, eager to see who would emerge victorious.

The void within a thousand miles around Guo Huinian suddenly collapsed, as if the pillars of heaven had been shattered, and the world was crumbling.

Guo Huinian's eyes finally flashed with a hint of seriousness, and he pinched his fingers together, causing the golden light on his body to surge, and then immediately retract, coalescing into a golden armor.

The armor had a massive dragon pattern on its chest, with lines flowing smoothly from the pattern, forming scales that extended to the entire body, and occasionally spewing out golden flames, making it seem invincible.

As soon as the golden armor was formed, the seven people launched their attacks, unleashing seven indescribable forces of law that collided with Guo Huinian's body, merging with the Time Law's power on his surface.

The seven forces of law hesitated for a moment as they intertwined with the golden light, and in that instant, Guo Huinian transformed into a golden light, shooting upwards.

The golden light broke through the seven forces of law that had been binding Guo Huinian, but the golden armor on his body, along with the golden light surrounding him, was immediately torn apart by the seven laws.

Guo Huinian's body hovered in the air, and the golden light on his forehead flashed several times, as a large amount of golden light emerged from his body.

The broken armor on his body was instantly repaired, and in the blink of an eye, he returned to normal, as if nothing had happened.

"Guo Huinian has already mastered the power of time reversal, and ordinary means are no longer able to harm him," the Wheel of Reincarnation Master said, his eyes flashing with a hint of surprise.

"Those who know me, Master, also know that," Guo Huinian replied with a smile.

"Time reversal is indeed a powerful ability, but how many times can you use it in your current state?" the Devil Master asked, his voice cold and mocking.

As soon as he spoke, his eyes flashed with a silver light, and the void around Guo Huinian was instantly frozen, his body bound by the laws.

"His surroundings have been frozen, hurry!" the Devil Master roared.

The others didn't need to be told, and they immediately launched their attacks, unleashing five or six domains of law that overlapped and bound Guo Huinian's body, making it even more difficult for him to move.

Only the Wheel of Reincarnation Master didn't act, his brow furrowed in concern, a hint of doubt in his eyes.

"It's futile," Guo Huinian said with a smile, his armor suddenly flashing, releasing a thousand golden lights that cut through the frozen space around him.

The sound of tearing fabric echoed through the air, as the space around him was once again shattered, and the binding forces of the domains of law were also broken.

Guo Huinian was instantly freed, and with a swift movement, he turned around, raised his arm, and launched a massive golden fist at the seven people, the same divine ability he had used before.

This time, the fist was even more condensed, containing ten times the power of the previous one, and the Devil Master's frozen space was instantly shattered.

"He's using that move again? Guo Huinian is already on the verge of being merged with the Heavenly Dao, and he's no longer daring to use too much of his law power. Let's work together to break him!" the Devil Master said coldly.

"This is a heaven-sent opportunity, we'll exhaust him to death today!" Yin Cheng said with a laugh.

"Guo Huinian, what are you trying to do? It seems like you're intentionally delaying time?" the Wheel of Reincarnation Master asked, his brow furrowed in concern.

As he pondered, the seven people joined forces, breaking through the golden fist and continuing to pursue Guo Huinian.
