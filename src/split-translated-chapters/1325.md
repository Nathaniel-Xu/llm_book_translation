Han Li's eyes watched as the Lei Kui's eye and the Qing Zhu Feng Yun Sword entered the Xuan Tian Gourd, and with a wave of his hand, he sealed the opening of the gourd. He then picked up the gourd with his other hand and gently shook it.

"Rumble rumble"

A low and muffled sound of thunder immediately came from within the gourd.

The symbols on the surface of the gourd flashed with a bright light, and golden electric threads flowed out from the surface, causing Han Li's palm to emit a burst of blue smoke, which quickly dissipated.

Almost simultaneously, a clear and crisp sound came from the gourd, and a fine crack appeared on its surface.

The sound of cracking grew louder, and the crack spread like a spider web, covering the entire surface of the gourd.

Han Li saw this and, without saying a word, raised his hand and tossed the gourd into the air.

He then used his hands to manipulate the time laws, reaching out to the gourd as if gathering fire, and clamping down on it with his palms. The threads of the time laws condensed into fine, golden threads that wrapped around the gourd, forming a layer of golden light.

The golden electric threads and the time laws intertwined, but were soon covered by the time laws, forming a brilliant golden light that surrounded the gourd.

With the time laws' restraint and protection, the Xuan Tian Gourd, which had cracked like a broken ceramic, did not immediately collapse. Instead, the symbols etched onto its surface grew brighter.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and a faint, purple light appeared in his eyes as he probed the interior of the gourd.

He saw that the 72 Qing Zhu Feng Yun Swords had transformed into small, golden swords, all of which were stuck to the walls of the gourd, maintaining their sword formation. The Lei Kui's eye, on the other hand, was suspended in the center of the gourd, surrounded by a dark green glow.

The dark green glow was naturally familiar with the Qing Zhu Feng Yun Sword, but it was like meeting a formidable opponent when it encountered the Lei Kui's eye. The two clashed fiercely, neither giving an inch.

In terms of power, the Lei Kui's eye was superior, and its continuous release of electric threads had already cracked the walls of the gourd. If not for Han Li's assistance with the time laws, the gourd would have already collapsed.

However, the dark green glow had the help of the sword formation, which reduced the difference in power between the two. The situation was now evenly matched.

The gourd's interior was filled with the sound of clashing, as the dark green glow and the golden electric threads alternated in intensity.

"Rumble"

After several hours, the Xuan Tian Gourd finally could not withstand the pressure and exploded in a loud, thunderous sound.

A dark green glow burst out of the gourd, transforming into a brilliant, dark green sword light that split the sky and the sea, creating a rift that stretched tens of thousands of feet in all directions.

A deep, dark crack appeared in the sky, and a series of spatial fluctuations emanated from within.

Han Li's gaze narrowed as he looked at the rift, and he saw that the Lei Kui's eye had transformed into a brilliant, golden light, with flashes of lightning-like movements within. It seemed as if a group of Lei Kui beasts were moving about.

The Qing Zhu Feng Yun Swords, which had been floating in the air, suddenly flashed with light and flew towards the golden glow.

As the swords entered the light, its brightness increased several times, and Han Li's eyes could not see what was happening inside. However, he sensed a strange fluctuation coming from within.

Suddenly, a sharp, piercing sound came from within the light, and a series of sword lights burst out, flying towards the surrounding space.

Han Li's eyes narrowed as he watched one of the sword lights fly towards the slowly closing spatial rift.

He raised an eyebrow, and without hesitation, he reached out with his palm, which was covered in golden light, and inserted it into the rift.

"Whoosh"

Han Li's sleeve was instantly torn to shreds, but his arm remained intact.

However, when he looked at what he had pulled out, he was shocked to see that it was not a Qing Zhu Feng Yun Sword, but a small, exquisite, jade-green hand.

"This is..."

Before he could finish his sentence, the surrounding space was filled with flashes of light, and a group of small, jade-green figures, each about a foot tall, appeared before him.

They were all wearing golden armbands and anklets, with intricate, golden patterns etched onto them. Some of them sat on his shoulders, while others climbed onto his hair or hung from his arms.

Han Li counted them and found that there were exactly 72 of these small figures.

"Could this be... the sword spirits born from the fusion of the Lei Kui's eye and the Qing Zhu Feng Yun Sword within the Xuan Tian Gourd?" Han Li wondered.

As if sensing his thoughts, the small figures flew up into the air, and their bodies glowed with green light before transforming into 72 Qing Zhu Feng Yun Swords.

However, these swords were different from the ones before, as they were all etched with golden, lightning-like patterns, and each one radiated an aura of a third-grade immortal artifact.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed in surprise, and he realized that these swords were far more powerful than he had anticipated.

The 72 swords flew up into the air, forming a series of sword formations that seemed to be controlled by an invisible force.

"Rumble rumble"
As the sound of thunder rolled in, a majestic thousand-meter Heavenly Gate appeared above the nine heavens.

In an instant, the surrounding golden clouds churned with a thousand different auras, and the tightly closed gate burst forth with a suppressive aura, causing Han Li to feel a shiver run down his spine. The power of the thousand sword-wielding children was even greater than he had anticipated.

A thought arose in his mind, and the Heavenly Gate began to rumble loudly. Inside, a sea of golden light churned with thousands of colorful lightning dragons, waiting for a signal to burst forth.

The void outside the gate was shaken to its core, and the surrounding space began to crack and split.

Han Li's lips curled into a smile, and with a slight movement of his divine sense, the Heavenly Gate slowly closed, and the surrounding golden clouds dissipated.

The seventy-two flying swords flashed with light, transforming back into the Jade Children, and flew back to Han Li.

Han Li opened his left sleeve, and the children flew in, disappearing from sight.

Later, Han Li pondered for a moment, then waved his hand, opening the Flower Branch Cave Heaven.

Inside the silver light gate, Zi Ling stood by the window of the bamboo pavilion, turning to ask, "How did it go?"

"It's done," Han Li replied, hesitating. "I..."

"Go do what you need to do. If possible, I'd like to accompany you," Zi Ling said with a gentle smile.

"The journey to the Heavenly Court is too perilous, I cannot bring you," Han Li shook his head.

"I know. I'll wait for your safe return," Zi Ling said, as if she had expected this.

"Regardless, I'll take you back to the Nether Realm first. After that, you can stay there or go to the Devil Realm, but I'll definitely come back to find you," Han Li said, nodding.

"Alright," Zi Ling replied.

After leaving the painted realm, Han Li took Zi Ling's hand, and with his other hand, he formed a seal to cast the Thunder Array technique.

A strange noise echoed, and the lightning cloud, which had shrunk to less than a hundred miles in diameter, was struck by countless golden lightning bolts, disappearing in an instant.

...

A month passed in a hurry.

In the Nether Realm, on the island in the middle of the Yellow Spring Lake, a black-clad woman paced back and forth on the stone steps of the great hall, her face filled with anxiety.

Standing outside the hall, two ghostly guards exchanged a glance, both shaking their heads.

The woman, "Jiao San", had been pacing for over ten days, seemingly waiting for someone, but that person had yet to arrive.

After two attempts to persuade her, they had given up.

Just then, a golden light flashed in the void outside the island, unaffected by the whirlwind, and landed on the island.

Jiao San sensed the aura and was surprised, then delighted, and was about to fly out to greet them when she felt a sudden presence, and Han Li and Zi Ling appeared before her.

"Where is the Master?" Han Li asked, releasing Zi Ling's hand.

"Let's go inside and talk," Jiao San replied, her face troubled.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he took Zi Ling's hand again, entering the hall together.

After the door closed, Jiao San spoke directly, "Father has already departed for the Central Plains Divine Realm."

"What? He left first?" Han Li's brow rose in surprise.

"Because of Mother's situation, Father feels guilty, and also due to other matters, the Reincarnation Hall has launched an attack ahead of schedule. The entire True Immortal Realm will only become more chaotic," Jiao San explained.

"Father said that the Heavenly Court has promised to release Mother if he goes to the Central Plains Divine Realm, but things won't be that simple. Previously, he used many methods to investigate Mother's prison, but to no avail. However, he did discover who had captured Mother," Jiao San said.

"Who was it?" Han Li asked immediately.

"Feng Qing Shui. You should be familiar with that name," Jiao San replied.

"It's him..." Han Li's eyes narrowed, recalling their past encounter in the Gray Realm. He knew that Feng Qing Shui was a Water Attribute Law's Dao Ancestor.

"I want to gather all the information I can about him: his sect background, the location of his immortal mansion, his current whereabouts, and his past battles with others," Han Li said gravely.

"Do you plan to find him?" Jiao San asked, her brow raised.

"He told me about Feng Qing Shui, didn't he, so that I would go find him?" Han Li replied calmly.
