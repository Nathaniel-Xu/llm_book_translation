Chapter:

Unlike the others, who were marveling at the scene, Li Qi Ma's face was stern, his hands swiftly weaving a spell as he faced the massive door. The blood-colored mist that had previously spilled out from the door suddenly surged towards him, rolling and churning.

Hou San, seeing this, immediately reacted, hastily summoning the blood mist as well.

The others only realized what was happening when they saw that the blood mist had already been divided between Li Qi Ma and Hou San, leaving them with only a few stray wisps to absorb. They could only sigh and begin to cultivate.

As soon as Hou San absorbed the blood mist, his expression changed dramatically, his eyes flashing with a fierce red light, his entire being shaking with pain.

He forcibly suppressed the power within him, only recovering after a long time.

"This power is so chaotic, so violent? Han brother, what...?" Hou San's eyes were filled with shock and horror.

On the other side, Li Qi Ma had absorbed more blood mist, but his condition was much better than Hou San's. However, he too was shocked and felt that if the power within the door was indeed so fierce, Han Li's chances of survival were slim.

Meanwhile, within the crimson copper door, Han Li's body swayed unsteadily, buffeted by the waves of blood-colored wind.

He struggled to steady himself, then looked around, seeing only a vast expanse of blood-colored void, and a thick, pungent smell of blood filling the air.

Above him, a massive blood-colored sun hung suspended, radiating a bloody glow that illuminated the surroundings.

Below him, a series of massive blood-colored whirlpools churned and eddied, filled with a chaotic and violent power.

Han Li, suspended in mid-air, felt a sense of familiarity with this power, reminiscent of the turmoil within his own blood vessels when they had gone awry in the Jī Líng Kōng Jìng.

He suspected that this was why his own small heaven and earth had formed a connection with this void, allowing him to enter the door.

After a moment of contemplation, Han Li set aside this thought and sat down, his hands weaving a spell as he activated the Xīng Lóng Twelve Transformations and the Tiān Shā Zhēn Yù.

A bloody glow and a dark glow erupted from his body, and twelve spirit shadows coalesced into a ring around him, swirling and churning.

As he did so, the void around him began to change, the blood-colored whirlpools below accelerating, spewing forth blood-colored mist that swirled towards him, entering the ring of spirit shadows.

The twelve spirit shadows seemed to come to life, their mouths opening wide as they devoured the mist.

Han Li felt a searing pain in his back, his blood vessels bursting with a fierce, burning energy.

He let out a mighty roar, his body trembling with the power that had entered him.

The next moment, his body was wracked with a tearing, burning pain, and his previously dormant acupoints began to stir.

Han Li's eyes blazed with a fierce red light, his face deathly pale, sweat and blood dripping from his brow, his teeth clenched in agony.

But in his heart, there was only one thought: "Endure, I must endure!"

Meanwhile, within the first crimson copper door, a different scene unfolded.

Liu Yue'er and the others had entered the same door, but found themselves in separate spaces, each with their own void.

Liu Yue'er stood alone on a massive, circular altar, surrounded by nine towering pillars, each inscribed with dense, blood-colored symbols that pulsed with a fierce energy.

A massive, snow-white fox with nine tails hovered above, its tails entwining the pillars, its body radiating a brilliant, flowing light that streamed down the pillars and into the altar.

On the altar, a smaller, six-tailed white fox lay bound by blood-colored chains, its jaws clenched, its eyes fixed on the nine-tailed fox above.

The light from the altar flowed into the smaller fox's body, filling it with a fierce, pulsating energy.
The six-tailed white fox was naturally Lü Lè'ěr, while the nine-tailed giant fox was merely the manifestation of the True Spirit King's bloodline power.

It had no spiritual awareness, and its narrow, long eyes only shone with a golden light, with a lotus flower pattern on its forehead, also shining brightly. However, when Lü Lè'ěr looked at it, she felt a strange connection between them, a bond that made her feel that the pain she was currently enduring was not so unbearable.

As the powers continued to merge, Lü Lè'ěr's aura also began to rise, and a light enveloped her, with the seventh tail of the fox appearing as a shadow.

...

In another space within the door, there was no altar, but a massive mountain peak hung in the air.

The mountain peak was a deep red color, with a giant ape statue carved on it, its fur standing on end, its arms like pillars, and its chest muscles bulging. The image was unmistakably that of the Mountain Ape.

Below the mountain peak, a white giant ape had transformed into its true form, carrying the mountain peak on its back, moving forward with a bent back.

Its shoulders were already bloody, and its hands were embedded in the red mountain peak, making it seem as if it was one with the mountain, being forced to move forward.

The white ape was naturally Yuán Shān Bái, and the bloodline power he was to inherit was within the blood mountain. He had to do as their tribe's name "Moving Mountain Ape" suggested, carrying the mountain and moving forward, without stopping.

When the blood mountain finally merged with him, he would truly inherit the Mountain Ape's bloodline.

For the sake of the wilderness and their tribe, he had to persevere.

...

In another space, there was no altar, nor a blood mountain, only a winding stream that flowed gently.

On the riverbank, a middle-aged man in a black robe sat with a young boy in white clothes, both barefoot, soaking in the stream, with looks of comfort on their faces.

The middle-aged man had a sword-like brow and starry eyes, with a handsome face that deserved the description "flourishing and elegant". A golden pattern on his forehead seemed to be an extra vertical eye, but it didn't look out of place, instead adding to his charm.

The young boy had red lips and white teeth, with eyes like ink, and a face that was still childish, but had some similarities to the man. When he grew up, he would definitely be a handsome young man.

"The name 'Little White' isn't bad..." the middle-aged man said with a smile.

"Dad, what was my original name?" the young boy asked, looking at the man.

"You naturally took my surname 'Mò', and as for your name...I didn't have time to choose one," the middle-aged man replied with a hint of apology.

"Oh..." the young boy said, slightly disappointed.

The middle-aged man was Mò Yù, and the young boy was Xiao Bái, who had transformed into a human.

"Back when I traveled through the immortal realm, I ignored the differences between humans and demons, and hid my identity to be with your mother. We fell in love, and when you were born, we were pursued by the Heavenly Court. To ensure I could bring you back to the wilderness realm safely, your mother diverted the Heavenly Court's attention, and never returned," Mò Yù said with a sigh.

"Was Mother killed by the Heavenly Court for my sake?" Xiao Bái asked, his heart burning with anger.

"Not just your mother," Mò Yù said slowly, "when I brought you to the border between the wilderness realm and the Northern Cold Immortal Realm, your uncle Yuán Gāng came to our aid, and we fought against the Heavenly Court's three Daos. We didn't fall behind, but unfortunately, Gǔ Huò Jīn intervened, and we were no match for him."

"Despicable," Xiao Bái said, his anger rising. "He must have taken advantage of your weakness after the battle with the three Daos."

Mò Yù's expression turned serious, and he warned, "Xiao Bái, you must promise me that you will not seek revenge against him in the future. He is a powerful foe, and even if we weren't weakened, we might not have been his match."

Xiao Bái's heart rebelled against the idea, but seeing his father's worried expression, he nodded and changed the subject.

"What happened next?" he asked.

"That battle was earth-shattering...the Heavenly Court's three Daos were killed or injured, forcing Gǔ Huò Jīn to intervene personally. Later, I and your uncle Yuán Gāng died in battle, and I used my remaining strength to seal most of my bloodline power within you. To prevent discovery, I sealed your bloodline and memories, and even froze you in place," Mò Yù said, his eyes filled with reminiscence.

"No wonder I can only transform into a human now..." Xiao Bái said, somewhat resigned.

"I had no choice...but now that this wisp of my soul has seen you, you still look like you did in my memories, which is not bad," Mò Yù said with a smile, stroking Xiao Bái's head.

Xiao Bái felt a sense of comfort and security, unlike when the Golden Boy had touched his head, making him feel awkward and wanting to avoid it.

"Why did the Heavenly Court pursue us?" Xiao Bái asked, looking up at his father.

"It's related to our innate divine abilities," Mò Yù explained. "Our True Spirit Eye can see into the void, tracing the threads of fate that connect people and events, allowing us to predict some future changes."
