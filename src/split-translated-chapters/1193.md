"I am the one who laughs, I am the one who is crazy, you rebels are just dogs in the Immortal Palace, what is there to be carefree about?"

As he thought about those rebels, now nothing more than dogs in the Immortal Palace, the gray-robed man felt a sense of satisfaction, and he gulped down a mouthful of wine, laughing loudly.

Two of his trusted disciples, who had been exiled to this place with him, exchanged a glance, and transmitted a message to each other:

"Master is having one of his episodes again, let's not let anyone hear about it, or we'll be dragged down with him..."

"I was fortunate enough to become his direct disciple thanks to the ancestral incense, but now I'm being dragged down by him, stuck in this broken place, when will we ever have a chance to rise?"

The two disciples said no more, and instead leaned against the railing, gazing out at the depths below, where a gray mist filled the air, and the shadows of floating mountains flickered in and out of sight.

But no matter how beautiful the scenery, it was dull after a while.

Just then, a loud horn blast echoed from the depths below.

The two disciples furrowed their brows, and looked over at the gray-robed man, but he seemed completely uninterested, still drinking alone, his face twisted in anger.

The two disciples saw this, and smiled wryly, before leaping into the air, and speeding downwards.

They hadn't flown more than a thousand feet before they saw the mist below, and the shadows of countless figures flying upwards, like crazy.

"It's not good, the White Ghosts have come, the White Ghosts have come..." the cries echoed up from below, accompanied by the sound of wailing.

The two disciples heard this, and their faces changed, one of them shouting: "Aren't there arrays to block them? What's there to be afraid of?"

"They can't be blocked, the White Ghosts have gone mad...!" someone shouted.

"What's going on, tell us!" the other disciple grabbed a terrified junior, and shouted.

"The White Ghosts below have gone mad... they've broken through the mist, and aren't afraid of the arrays, they're pouring up by the thousands, and destroying the arrays..." the junior disciple said, his voice shaking.

The two disciples heard this, and were about to ask another question, when they saw the mist below, and the sound of "隆隆" echoed up, as a massive, indistinct shadow surged upwards.

"Form the array, form the array, form the array..." one of the disciples shouted, his voice trembling.

But at this point, the crowd was in chaos, and no one was listening.

"Whoever takes a step back will die!" just then, a loud shout echoed from above, and the gray-robed man descended from the sky, his figure suspended in mid-air.

He flung out his sleeve, and a blast of wind and thunder shook the air, dispelling the wine fumes, and restoring his dignity.

As he released his mid-Golden Immortal aura, the entire secret realm was instantly subdued.

"It's just a bunch of White Ghosts rebelling, this has happened many times before, even a ordinary elder who was stationed here was able to handle it, now that I'm here, what's there to be afraid of? Form the array at once!" the man said coldly.

His words had a profound effect, and the thousands of fleeing disciples finally calmed down, and began to form arrays.

As soon as the arrays were formed, the mist below began to churn, and countless White Ghosts surged out, climbing up the floating mountains, and attacking the arrays.

"Kill them..." the gray-robed man said coldly.

As soon as he spoke, the entire secret realm erupted into chaos, with massive explosions echoing through the air.

A large array erupted with flames, shooting out massive fireballs that streaked across the sky, and plummeted towards the depths below.

Other arrays unleashed icy blasts, forming massive ice cones that shot downwards, and other arrays released spiritual treasures and talismans, all of which struck the depths below.

The secret realm was in chaos, with explosions echoing through the air, and countless White Ghosts were killed, their bodies falling to the depths below, but even more White Ghosts surged up, piling up corpses on the floating mountains.

"Something's not right, something's not right..." the gray-robed man frowned, his eyes fixed on the scene below.

He focused his mind, and his divine sense shot downwards, probing the depths below.

But as he delved deeper, his divine sense was blocked, and he couldn't continue to probe downwards.

As he watched, the White Ghosts surged up, and were about to overwhelm the disciples, the gray-robed man raised his hand, and a massive, blue-green ring appeared behind him.
The grey-robed man pointed forward, and a circular ring of light appeared, shooting out beams of light that flew straight down, killing a large number of white ghosts.

However, as the grey-robed man watched more and more white ghosts die, he felt increasingly uneasy.

These white ghosts had already escaped the mist that obscured their vision, and they didn't seem to be attacking, but rather fleeing in terror. But what could be chasing them in this abyss?

Just as the grey-robed man was wondering, a strange aura began to emanate from the depths of the abyss, a grey-white mist that spread rapidly upwards.

From the mist, a group of robust, blue-skinned apes emerged, chasing after the white ghosts.

The white ghosts were no match for the apes, and they were quickly slaughtered. The apes then occupied the hovering mountain peak, brandishing wolf-toothed clubs and gazing up at the humans with ferocious eyes.

"Master, what are these things?" two disciples asked, fleeing back to the grey-robed man's side.

The grey-robed man didn't recognize them, and remained silent.

At this moment, a loud whistling sound came from the mist below, and a massive spiral of mist rose up, carrying three tall figures with it.

The grey-robed man gazed at the three figures, feeling a chill run down his spine. The aura emanating from them was so powerful that he didn't dare to look directly at them, and could only guess at their cultivation level, which seemed to be at least at the Taiyi Later Stage.

One of the three figures had eyes that were long and narrow, skin as white as a corpse, and a face that seemed to be devoid of blood. He was holding a small, white, cat-like creature with soft fur and large eyes.

If Han Li were present, he would have immediately recognized this person as Gui Mu, the one who had given them a hard time in the Grey Realm.

"Looks like a secret realm," Gui Mu said, stroking the creature in his arms, "but from the density of the spiritual energy here, it's definitely a Celestial Domain."

However, his eyes didn't seem to notice the thousands of Xuanlong Dao and Celestial Palace cultivators present.

"Who are you?" the grey-robed man asked, trying to muster his courage.

Gui Mu glanced at him, then turned to the two figures beside him and said, "Kill them all, destroy their souls, and don't leave a single one alive. Prepare to guide more of our people here."

As soon as he finished speaking, the two figures beside him vanished, and the blue-skinned apes charged upwards, attacking the cultivators.

The entire abyss was filled with the sound of screams and wails.

"Celestial Domain, we're here..." Gui Mu said, a cold smile spreading across his face.

...

The Zhouyuan Celestial Domain.

Recently, a shocking piece of news had spread throughout the eight great continents under the Celestial Domain.

The original Palace Master of the Celestial Palace, Ti Hu True Person, a great Da Luo cultivator, had suddenly gone mad one day and killed all 130+ Celestial Officials in the palace.

Even the Celestial Domain's Monitor, a cultivator with unfathomable power, was killed when he tried to stop him.

The entire Zhouyuan Celestial Domain was thrown into chaos, and Ti Hu True Person disappeared without a trace.

However, just seven days later, his name appeared on the "Heavenly Execution List" in the Celestial Domain, becoming a fugitive with a large reward on his head.

Rumors spread that Ti Hu True Person was not actually mad, but had been a spy from the Wheel of Rebirth Temple all along, and had escaped back to the temple after completing his mission.

The Heavenly Court sent several Monitor Sages to capture him, but he remained elusive.

...

The Jinnan Celestial Domain.

A long-abandoned secret realm suddenly appeared, attracting the attention of the four great sects and the Celestial Palace.

Originally, the Celestial Palace had mediated the distribution of resources in the secret realm, but after the various factions entered the realm, two of the great sects' leaders and core disciples were killed, with the culprit's trail leading to the other two sects.

The four great sects then began to fight each other, with each side suffering heavy losses.

Just as the Celestial Palace thought that the conflict was getting out of hand, the four great sects suddenly turned their attention to the Jinnan Celestial Palace.

It turned out that during their infighting, the sects had discovered some hidden clues, and realized that the Celestial Palace had been manipulating them all along.

The four great sects then joined forces, overthrowing the Jinnan Celestial Palace and forcing the Palace Master to flee.
