Jiao San was able to temporarily repel the Bone Emperor with the help of the surrounding restrictions, but her face flashed with a hint of pain.

It was clear that with her current abilities, forcibly activating the restrictions in this place was still too much of a strain.

The Bone Emperor, who had been shocked back two steps by a Great Luo realm junior, was furious, and his anger was not directed at the four subordinates who had fallen, but rather at Jiao San. He punched out with his fist.

The white bone giant claw also clenched into a fist, resembling a massive rod that stretched across the sky, and with the Bone Emperor's movement, it also punched out with a speed that exceeded human thought. The Bone Emperor's arm had just moved, and the giant bone fist had already struck the dark red light barrier.

Jiao San immediately incanted and activated the surrounding Wheel of Rebirth restrictions to counterattack, but her reaction speed was much slower than the Bone Emperor's. She was only able to activate a portion of the Wheel of Rebirth restrictions.

The two massive forces collided with a deafening crash!

The Bone Emperor and Jiao San had clashed twice before, but each time, one side would use their divine ability, and the other would first withstand it before counterattacking. This was the first time they had clashed head-on.

The two light auras, one white and one red, collided and exploded violently, and the nearby void was ravaged, space fragments and other things were instantly destroyed, and a massive storm swept across the area.

This storm was different from ordinary storms, as it was filled with white and dark red light, each beam of light resembling a sharp knife that cut through the void, causing it to shatter and fragment.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat as a tangible golden light burst forth from his body, instantly enveloping Shi Chuan Kong and the others, before flying towards a distant location, avoiding the massive storm.

Xue Li and the others also quickly fled, but their speed was slightly slower than Han Li's.

Xue Li was able to react quickly, and his body was surrounded by a blazing blood light, which transformed into a burning blood-colored rainbow, allowing him to escape.

However, the black-faced giant, the black-robed ghost, and the three others were not so lucky, as they were swept up by the massive storm.

The black-faced giant, who had been injured by the island's restrictions, was unable to recover, and his face immediately changed as he was swept up by the storm.

He let out a loud roar, and his body transformed into a massive, double-headed, four-armed black skeleton.

The skeleton's body was covered in cracks, likely due to its previous injuries.

A layer of black flames erupted from the skeleton's body, blocking the storm's attack, and it flew outwards.

The black-robed ghost also let out a sharp cry, and its body transformed into a long, thin, half-transparent black snake, which also flew outwards, its speed faster than the black skeleton.

The storm swept past the black snake, and some of it even penetrated its body.

However, the black snake was not unscathed, as its body rapidly shrunk, and its aura weakened.

Just as it was about to escape the storm, a gray, ghostly light shot out from the storm and entered the black snake's body. It was the ghost of Gui Wu.

The black snake's face contorted in fear, and it opened its mouth to scream, but no sound came out.

A layer of gray light spread across the black snake's body, and it rapidly expanded, covering its entire body. The black snake transformed into a gray color.

The black snake's face also changed, and it transformed into Gui Wu's face.

The gray light on the black snake's body flashed once more, and then it retracted, transforming back into the black snake's original form.

The black snake continued to fly outwards, and with a swift motion, it escaped the storm.

The black snake flew a short distance before stopping, and its body transformed back into the black-robed ghost's form.

Xue Li was also present.

The black-faced giant, who had transformed into a skeleton, also flew out, and landed near the black-robed ghost, transforming back into his original form.

"Where's Gui Wu?" Xue Li asked.

"I didn't see him, perhaps he died in the storm," the black-faced giant replied, his expression unchanged.

Xue Li looked towards the gray stone temple, where the storm was still raging, and everything was being destroyed.

He quickly looked away, not asking any further questions.

Han Li and the others had also reached a relatively safe distance, and they turned to look towards the stone temple.

Although the storm blocked their view, they could still see the situation at the temple.

The dark red light barrier around the temple was violently shaking, and had thinned out by more than half, but it still had not shattered, stubbornly resisting the white bone giant fist.

Inside the dark red light barrier, Jiao San's face was pale, and a stream of blood flowed from her mouth, clearly showing that she had suffered severe injuries.

However, she was still stubbornly incanting and casting spells, trying to stabilize the dark red light barrier and the surrounding Yellow Spring's restrictions.

The Bone Emperor coldly laughed, and raised his hand, pointing at Jiao San.

The white bone giant fist suddenly burst forth with a brilliant light, and then one of its fingers exploded, transforming into a wave of white bone-colored light.

The light wave penetrated the dark red light barrier, but it had also weakened by more than half.

Jiao San's face changed, and she quickly flew back, her hands waving as she cast a series of dark red light beams to block the attack.
Only the bone-white light wave's speed was too fast, instantly catching up and breaking through the dark red light's obstruction, although it weakened again, it still swept past Jiao San's body.

Jiao San's body immediately let out a sound like popping beans, her mouth overflowing with blood, and her breath weakening rapidly.

Her internal bones were all cracked, and her internal organs suffered severe damage.

If not for Jiao San's cultivation of the reincarnation law, which resisted part of the bone-white light wave's power, she would have already exploded and died.

She took a deep breath, and didn't fall down, barely stabilizing her body.

Just then, "Boom!" Another bone finger exploded.

A wave of bone-white light once again seeped into the light shield, heading towards Jiao San.

Jiao San was already struggling to stand, with no strength left to escape, and her eyes showed a desperate expression, but it quickly disappeared. For some reason, she looked up in the direction of Han Li, her gaze complex.

Far away, Han Li saw this scene, and his eyebrows furrowed slightly.

Just then, two figures flew up from below, blocking Jiao San's body, and it was the Cow Head and Horse Face ghost generals from below.

"Junior Master, we'll block the Bone Emperor's attack, you quickly go in and warn the Lord!" the Cow Head ghost general roared, swinging his iron staff forward.

A series of staff shadows appeared, forming a staff mountain.

Each staff shadow had large patches of red and blue light, which merged into a flower, heading towards the bone-white light wave.

The Horse Face ghost general also swung his red crystal lock chain and peeled ghost claw, and the air in front of him crackled with a loud noise, as countless red lock chains appeared, weaving into a lock chain wall.

The lock chain wall in front of the white light flashed, and a small mountain-sized white bone ghost claw appeared, with white bone flames burning on it, grasping towards the bone-white light wave.

The Cow Head and Horse Face ghost generals' cultivation had reached the Great Luo realm, and their joint attack was quite powerful.

The bone-white light wave silently descended, and the two ghost generals' attack was like paper, instantly shattering.

The Cow Head and Horse Face ghost generals had expected their attack wouldn't have much effect, but it was so easily broken through, and their faces still showed a shocked expression.

However, they didn't retreat, and instead charged towards the bone-white light wave, their bodies flashing with black light, and their breath rapidly expanding, before suddenly exploding.

But the bone-white light wave's speed suddenly increased, and before the two ghost generals could explode, it swept past their bodies.

The two ghost generals' bodies immediately stopped, and their internal bones let out a series of crisp sounds, before turning into a puddle of flesh.

The bone-white light wave continued to surge downwards, and in an instant, it reached Jiao San's body, and descended.

The Cow Head and Horse Face ghost generals hadn't managed to stall for much time, and Jiao San's internal situation was still a mess, with no improvement.

She smiled bitterly, and closed her eyes, waiting for death.

Just then, "Hum!" A wave of golden light suddenly appeared, enveloping the gray stone temple.

The bone-white light wave paused, and its speed immediately slowed down by several dozen times.

Far away, Han Li's body was surrounded by a golden glow, and his surroundings were filled with a golden wave, forming a large golden spiritual domain.

The wailing souls, Jin Tong, and the others had disappeared without a trace.

Jiao San felt the change in her surroundings, and opened her eyes, showing a surprised expression, and barely managed to dodge to the side, avoiding the bone-white light wave's attack.

"You human brat, I knew you had ulterior motives, but I didn't expect you to be so bold. If it wasn't for your special physique and divine soul, which can help me resist the Heavenly Way, I would have killed you on the spot!" the Bone Emperor said coldly, and swung his hand.

Han Li's head was met with a loud explosion, and a white bone giant claw appeared, grasping downwards.

The giant claw's power was immense, and the air, space, and vital energy around it were all frozen, turning into an unbreakable diamond.

But before the giant claw appeared, a golden great path had already appeared under Han Li's feet, and his figure immediately became blurry, disappearing before the giant claw's power could reach him.

The dark red light shield in front of the void moved, and a golden great path emerged, trying to enter the dark red light shield, but was blocked.

The golden great path's figure flashed, and Han Li's figure appeared on it.

This golden great path was the True Words Sect's teleportation divine ability, the "Ten Directions Great Path", which he had cultivated when he received the inheritance from the Old Ancestor Miro in the Yan Luo's estate.

"Jiao San, quickly let me in!" Han Li urgently transmitted his voice to Jiao San.

He had currently cultivated the divine ability, but he didn't think he could face the Bone Emperor alone.

Jiao San seemed to be shocked by the situation, but she quickly reacted, and pointed her finger at the dark red light shield.

"You think you can just leave? Come back!" the Bone Emperor suddenly turned his head, and swung his hand.

The bone fist that hit the light shield suddenly turned into a claw, and grasped towards Han Li.

The bone claw hadn't reached Han Li yet, but a powerful and strange law had already arrived, directly piercing through Han Li's protective law, and seeping into his body.

Han Li's intuition told him that the void around him was tightening, and his bones were making a cracking sound, as if they would shatter at any moment.

His body was trembling uncontrollably, as if it would explode at any moment.
