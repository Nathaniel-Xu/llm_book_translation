Han Li's voice fell, and with a single hand, he pinched a sword incantation, waving it towards his back.

Seventy-two sword spirits immediately flew out, surrounding Jin Tong and the three others, trapping them in the center.

"Zhilalala"

Immediately, a brilliant flash of lightning illuminated the surroundings, and a massive thunder array was activated, engulfing their figures in a sea of lightning, causing them to disappear.

Without any further worries, Han Li suddenly crouched down, sitting cross-legged in the void.

His hands pinched a spell incantation, and the Great Five Elements Illusory World technique within him began to operate at full force.

Above his head, a golden moon slowly rotated, radiating brilliant light in all directions.

The starlight transformed from the Broken Time and Flowing Fire also flickered with a dazzling light, like a starry sky.

The River of Time, transformed from the Time Purification Bottle, surged and flowed, swirling around him.

The majestic mountain range, condensed from the Illusory World Sand, undulated and stretched out, extending for miles, with the dense forest transformed from the Eastern Yu Divine Tree swaying wildly.

All of this formed a breathtaking scenery of stars, moon, mountains, and rivers, constantly flowing and transforming, shaking the heavens and stirring the universe!

Within Han Li's spiritual domain, time and space transformed at an incredible speed, as if the gates of the river had opened, increasing the speed by a hundredfold.

The earth-attribute law forces within the surrounding void began to surge into Xuan Yuan Jie's body at an incredible rate, a hundred times faster than before.

"Rumble rumble..."

A series of muffled sounds echoed from the void, and Han Li's divine sense stirred, looking down towards the void below.

He saw that the void was shaking violently, as seven or eight great continents from the Immortal Realm were breaking away, step by step, traversing the Qing Ming Realm, the Tian Feng Realm, and the Tian Wai Realm, flying towards this domain.

However, as the continents rose, when they entered the Qing Ming Realm, countless escaping lights flew away from them, fleeing from the continents. When they entered the Tian Feng Realm, there were fewer people escaping.

When they truly entered the Tian Wai Realm, the massive continents began to shatter, the land breaking apart, and they slowly dissipated into the heavens, leaving behind only a powerful earth-attribute law force, converging towards Xuan Yuan Jie's body.

As more and more law forces gathered on his body, Xuan Yuan Jie's aura became increasingly refined, and he became further and further away from humanity, closer and closer to the Dao.

Xuan Yuan Jie's expression remained calm, but his eyes began to tremble slightly, as if resisting the surging powers. However, every inch of the earth's origin force was intimately connected to his Great Dao, and he couldn't reject it.

"Not enough, I'll give you some more," Han Li said, his eyes flashing with a hint of madness.

As soon as his voice fell, the time law forces within him surged out, the Five Elements Illusory World's worldly Dao patterns shining brightly, as threads of time law forces disappeared into the void, transforming into pure law forces that merged with Xuan Yuan Jie's body.

Within the spiritual domain, the accelerated time, which had already increased by a hundredfold, was further accelerated, reaching a million years in an instant.

The earth origin forces that had surged into Han Li's spiritual domain were instantly absorbed by Xuan Yuan Jie.

Even the countless meteorites in the domain's void shattered, contributing their earth-attribute origin forces, frantically pouring into Xuan Yuan Jie's body.

Finally, a massive earth vortex, almost boundless, appeared behind Xuan Yuan Jie, representing the most fundamental earth Dao power in the world, overflowing like a warm spring, enveloping Xuan Yuan Jie's body.

"No..." Xuan Yuan Jie's eyes flashed with a glimmer of reason.

But it was too late, the heavenly Dao's invasion had already begun.

"Han Li, stop, stop..." Xuan Yuan Jie tried to struggle free, his voice pleading.

At this moment, Han Li was also suffering, his time law forces flowing out at an incredible speed, his body already feeling the effects of intense exhaustion.

However, he remained expressionless, unmoved by Xuan Yuan Jie's pleas, continuing to drive the Five Elements Illusory World at full force.

Han Li knew that, with the current situation, it was far from enough to allow Xuan Yuan Jie to be fully assimilated by the heavenly Dao.

Only by further accelerating time, exhausting his own time law forces, might he have a chance to complete the heavenly Dao's invasion.

"Han Li, you and the Time Dao Ancestor are destined to be enemies, you will be separated by life and death. I can help you, I can help you..." Xuan Yuan Jie, in this moment, finally felt despair.

"Jin Tong was harmed by you in his past life, do you think I would believe you?" Han Li said, his voice devoid of any emotional tone.

"No! I can swear a Dao oath, I will not betray..." Xuan Yuan Jie was on the verge of hysteria.

Han Li heard this, and his heart hesitated for a moment.

After all, if he could gain the assistance of a Five Elements origin Dao Ancestor, he would have more confidence in his ascension to the heavenly court.

However, he quickly abandoned this idea.

The reason was that he had no guarantee that he could control a origin Dao Ancestor with a mere oath.

His mind made up, he no longer spoke, continuing to frantically exhaust his own law forces, accelerating Xuan Yuan Jie's heavenly Dao invasion.

Time passed, and Xuan Yuan Jie saw Han Li's determination to make him die, his initial pleas gradually turning to curses and insults, and finally, when he realized Han Li was about to collapse, he began to threaten him.

"Han Li, you can't hold on, I may be half-assimilated by the heavenly Dao, but I won't be completely destroyed. Soon, I'll crush your bones, extinguish your primordial spirit, and refine your soul. I'll make you wish you were dead, hahaha..."

The entire domain echoed with Xuan Yuan Jie's almost maniacal laughter.

This laughter reached Han Li's ears, but it was already a dull, indistinct humming.

At this moment, Han Li had truly reached his limit, his vision blurry, his body almost completely drained of power, the Five Elements Illusory World on the verge of collapse.

"Do you want me to lend you some power?" a ethereal voice suddenly echoed within Han Li's nearly exhausted mind.
Han Li was startled, and he hastily asked, "Who are you?"

"I... am you... you... are me..." the voice replied.

Han Li suddenly realized, "You're my self-corpse! Ever since I reached the peak of the Great Luo, I've been searching for you, and you've finally awakened in this state."

The self-corpse's response echoed in Han Li's mind, "Abandoning good and evil, as well as all seven emotions and six desires, you and I are the closest to each other. You are my true self, and I am your self."

Han Li sighed inwardly and asked, "Do you want to cause a rift between us now? If we separate, we'll both die instantly."

The self-corpse replied, "I said we're too similar, so your thoughts are my thoughts."

In the next instant, Han Li felt a warmth spread throughout his body, and the law energy that had dried up earlier suddenly surged back. The self-corpse had actually lent him its power.

However, the brief pause had given Xuan Yuan Jie an opportunity to catch his breath. Although Han Li had recovered half of his time law energy, he was still unable to continue.

Xuan Yuan Jie's eyes, which had been glowing with source symbols, suddenly darkened as he forcibly severed his connection with the Heavenly Dao.

At this moment, half of his body had merged into the void, and the remaining half was showing signs of petrification. This battle had indeed been extremely costly.

"Han Li..." Xuan Yuan Jie's voice was filled with hatred and anger as he let out a loud roar.

Before Han Li could respond, a golden light suddenly flashed from behind Xuan Yuan Jie at an unusual angle.

Within the golden light, the enormous true form of the Gold Devouring Bug, Jin Tong, suddenly appeared. A massive, blood-filled mouth opened, revealing a giant golden vortex inside, which emitted powerful law fluctuations.

Xuan Yuan Jie was shocked, and a yellow glow erupted from his body as he attempted to instantly move away.

However, Han Li had anticipated this and had already moved to his side. He raised his hand and struck Xuan Yuan Jie with a palm.

A burst of time law energy shot out from Han Li's palm, disrupting Xuan Yuan Jie's actions.

Xuan Yuan Jie had initially not feared Han Li's attack, but this brief interruption allowed Jin Tong's massive mouth to close in, swallowing Xuan Yuan Jie whole.

"No! I refuse to accept this..." Xuan Yuan Jie's voice grew fainter, as if he was being pulled into an endless void, until it was abruptly cut off when Jin Tong closed her mouth.

A rumbling sound echoed from within Jin Tong's abdomen, as if Xuan Yuan Jie was still struggling.

Jin Tong's body began to shrink rapidly, eventually returning to her female form.

Han Li looked at her and noticed that her appearance had changed significantly, losing her previous girlish aura. Her figure and demeanor had become more mature.

Her face was serene, with two vortex-like patterns swirling in her eyes. A transcendent aura began to emanate from her body.

"What's going on with your aura?" Han Li asked in confusion.

"It's not stable yet. I just need to meditate for a while, and my realm will stabilize," Jin Tong replied calmly.

Han Li said, "I had thought that advancing to the Dao Ancestor realm would be a grand and earth-shattering event, but it seems it's quite peaceful."

Jin Tong explained, "Normally, I should be absorbing the surrounding void right now, but since I swallowed Xuan Yuan Jie, a source Dao Ancestor, this power will be enough for me to digest for a while."

Han Li finally relaxed, feeling relieved.

Jin Tong said, "Thanks to you, I was able to succeed."

Han Li scolded, "You didn't tell me about your advancement to the Dao Ancestor realm. You're too reckless."

Just then, a group of people, including Yan Zhi, arrived from a distance. They were startled by Han Li's words, as no one had ever dared to speak to the Insect Ancestor like that before.

However, from Han Li's earlier actions, they had gathered that he and Jin Tong had a close relationship, so they didn't intervene. Instead, they sat down in the distance, meditating and adjusting their breathing.

Jin Tong's expression changed, and she pressed her hand against her abdomen. A golden light appeared on her palm.

"What's wrong?" Han Li asked urgently.

"It's just that Xuan Yuan Jie is resisting my digestive laws. As a Dao Ancestor, he's quite powerful," Jin Tong replied.

Han Li asked, "Is it serious? Do you need my help again?"

Jin Tong explained, "If we were outside, the outcome would be uncertain, but since he's now within my abdominal void, his defeat is inevitable. However, his earth source energy is somewhat troublesome."

Han Li glanced around and said, "This place is too exposed. You should suppress Xuan Yuan Jie's resistance, and then we'll leave and find a safe place for you to meditate. I'll protect you during that time."

Jin Tong nodded after a brief hesitation and began to suppress Xuan Yuan Jie's resistance.

Han Li turned to Yan Zhi and the others and said, "You should leave first. I'll take Jin Tong to a safe place to meditate."

The group nodded and departed, casting complex glances at Jin Tong as they left.

Han Li retrieved his treasures and sat down, taking out several pills and consuming them. He then closed his eyes and began to meditate.
