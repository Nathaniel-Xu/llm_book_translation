Han Li waited until Li Qi Ma had left before releasing his divine sense to investigate the entire courtyard. Finding nothing unusual, he waved his hand to set up layers of restrictions in various places, then turned and headed to a room deep within the courtyard.

After setting up multiple layers of restrictions in this room as well, he finally entered the Flower Branch Space.

Xiao Bai was flying back and forth in front of the bamboo pavilion, and upon seeing Han Li appear, he quickly flew over to greet him.

"Now that we're alone, tell me about the Golden Boy," Han Li asked gravely. "How did you and the others encounter the Nine Yuan Sect, and who was it that captured her?"

Xiao Bai answered swiftly, "After leaving Master's side, I and the Golden Boy traveled to the Jin Yuan Immortal Realm, where we found the Devouring Golden Immortal that you had previously encountered. After a great deal of effort, the Golden Boy managed to devour it, successfully breaking through to the Great Luo Realm."

Han Li's expression brightened at this news, but his joy was short-lived.

The fact that the Golden Boy had reached the Great Luo Realm yet was still captured meant that the person responsible must be extremely powerful. Rescuing her would be a daunting task.

Xiao Bai's next words confirmed Han Li's suspicions.

"Who would have thought that the Devouring Golden Immortal was actually owned by someone, and that person was a powerful figure from the Nine Yuan Sect? They personally pursued us, and we were forced to flee for many years. In the end, we were still caught. The person's strength was incredibly formidable, and after a fierce battle, the Golden Boy was captured. However, in the final moment, she used her magic to tear open the void and send me away, instructing me to find you and rescue her. I never expected to see you so soon."

Xiao Bai's words were rapid and fluent, recounting the entire sequence of events.

"Do you know the name of the person who captured you, and their position within the Nine Yuan Sect?" Han Li asked, his expression calm.

"The person's name is Gui Lingzi, and they seem to be one of the Four Great Sacred Envoys of the Nine Yuan Sect," Xiao Bai replied, his body trembling slightly as a hint of fear flashed in his eyes.

"Gui Lingzi..." Han Li's eyes narrowed.

He had learned a great deal about the Nine Yuan Sect from Lan Yu, including information about Gui Lingzi. According to rumor, Gui Lingzi's strength surpassed even that of the Miao Fa Immortal, and he was likely the leader of the Four Great Sacred Envoys.

Han Li's brow furrowed in concern. The Miao Fa Immortal's strength was already formidable, and Gui Lingzi's was even greater.

"Master, don't worry, that person didn't capture the Golden Boy to harm her. It seems they plan to use her as a gift, to be presented at a certain Bodhi banquet," Xiao Bai said hastily, seeing Han Li's expression.

"Bodhi banquet?" Han Li's face changed, and he realized that he had never heard of such a thing. It sounded like some sort of grand gathering.

He pondered for a moment before producing the mask from the Wheel of Rebirth Temple and offering a high price for information about the Bodhi banquet. Xiao Bai, sensing Han Li's intentions, obediently waited off to the side.

Unexpectedly, someone responded quickly.

According to legend, the Bodhi banquet was a grand gathering held every 5 million years in the Heavenly Court, with a long and storied history.

The Bodhi banquet was said to have originated from a Bodhi tree in the Heavenly Court, a tree that was rumored to have existed since the dawn of time. The Bodhi fruit that grew on this tree had the power to increase one's cultivation by millions of years.

Moreover, consuming the Bodhi fruit had a certain chance of transforming one's physical body into a Bodhi body, a state that was extremely beneficial for cultivating the laws of the universe.

Originally, the Bodhi tree only produced fruit once every billion years, but the Heavenly Court's Time Ancestor had used his ultimate divine power to make the tree produce fruit every 5 million years. Furthermore, whenever the Bodhi fruit ripened, the Time Ancestor would invite the powerful figures of the various immortal realms to gather and hold a grand banquet, distributing the Bodhi fruit among them.

In the past, the Bodhi banquet had been a simple gathering to discuss the distribution of the Bodhi fruit, but as the fruit's fame spread, more and more powerful figures requested to attend. The scale of the banquet grew, and the Bodhi fruit became scarce, leading to various powerful figures offering grand gifts to the Time Ancestor in exchange for a Bodhi fruit.

As the number of attendees grew, the Bodhi banquet became more than just a distribution of Bodhi fruit. It became a grand gathering where powerful figures would forge alliances, discuss major events, and establish agreements.

Today, the Bodhi banquet was the greatest event in the Heavenly Court, and indeed the entire True Immortal Realm.

The next Bodhi banquet was scheduled to take place in less than 3,000 years.

Han Li's brow furrowed as he considered this information.

According to Xiao Bai, Gui Lingzi likely planned to present the Golden Boy as a gift to the Heavenly Court, or perhaps even directly to the Time Ancestor.

Based on the information provided by the Wheel of Rebirth Temple, the Time Ancestor had a fondness for rare and unusual objects, whether they were strange treasures or exotic beasts. It was likely that Gui Lingzi intended to offer the Golden Boy as a gift to the Time Ancestor due to her rarity.

If the Golden Boy fell into the Time Ancestor's hands, Han Li would have no chance of rescuing her.

Although Jiao San had mentioned that there would be a task related to the Nine Yuan Sect, which could aid in rescuing the Golden Boy, Han Li couldn't rely on the Wheel of Rebirth Temple's assistance. He could only depend on himself.

The time limit of 3,000 years was extremely tight.

Currently, Han Li's cultivation needed to advance further, requiring him to find two more time law artifacts to enhance the time law crystals on the East Yi Divine Tree and the Huan Chen Hourglass. This would allow him to break through to the next level.

However, finding matching time law artifacts was extremely difficult.

Han Li had previously been fortunate enough to obtain a Water Yuan Time King Crystal, but such good fortune was unlikely to happen again.

"I'll find a way to rescue the Golden Boy," Han Li said, his mind racing with thoughts. "Xiao Bai, you've just awakened, so take these items and consume them to recover."

Han Li handed Xiao Bai a large pile of immortal artifacts and materials.

Xiao Bai's eyes widened as he took in the sight of the artifacts, and he hastily thanked Han Li.

"Ah, Master, when I and the Golden Boy captured the Devouring Golden Immortal, we infiltrated the Nine Yuan Sect. I found this item, but it's too difficult for me to digest. Perhaps it will be useful to you," Xiao Bai said, remembering something as he was about to consume the artifacts.
Then it opened its mouth and spat out a yellowish-brown bowl, which flew out and landed in front of Han Li.

The bowl looked somewhat damaged and seemed to be an ancient relic, with golden patterns etched onto its surface.

"This is..." Han Li's eyes lit up, and he stared at the bowl in a daze.

The bowl emitted a strong temporal fluctuation, which was identical to the temporal law fluctuations on the Xuan Chen hourglass.

Moreover, the bowl's temporal law power was enormous, surpassing even the Water Origin Crystal he had obtained recently.

"Xiao Bai, well done! This is exactly what I need!" Han Li exclaimed, embracing Xiao Bai and rubbing his head.

"Could it be that my luck has changed, and I've been obtaining temporal law objects one after another?" Han Li thought to himself.

"This thing is useful to Master, I'll go cultivate now." Xiao Bai smiled and flew off to the side with the materials Han Li had given him.

Han Li picked up the bowl, examining it carefully, and his excitement grew.

He took a deep breath and calmed his emotions, then sat down to circulate the "Great Five Elements Phantom Sutra". Five golden lights shot out and condensed into a golden ring, enveloping the yellowish-brown bowl.

With a cracking sound, the bowl shattered, releasing numerous golden light points that flew into the golden ring.

The ring then flashed with golden light, and sixty-three golden threads condensed and flew out, wrapping around the Xuan Chen hourglass.

Han Li's internal temporal law power surged again, and his circulation became smoother, filling him with joy.

Now, only the East Pole Divine Tree remained, and if he could find a matching temporal law object, he could attempt to break through to the Great Luo Realm.

Han Li's eyes flashed, and he flipped his hand to retrieve the Wheel of Reincarnation mask, increasing the price of the temporal law object by 50%.

Time was his most pressing concern now, with the Bodhi Feast approaching in less than a thousand years. This period was short, even for someone with his cultivation level.

Han Li had to break through to the Great Luo Realm before the Bodhi Feast to rescue Jintong from the Ninth Heaven Observatory.

As for the cost of the Sanyuan Stone, he had more than enough, with over 70 million stones in his possession.

Han Li removed the Wheel of Reincarnation mask and, after a brief moment of contemplation, exited the Flower Petal Space and went to the outer courtyard, where he instructed the attendants to inform Li Qi that he would be staying on Mount Baishi.

He then returned to the inner room, re-entered the Flower Petal Space, and raised his hand.

A silver light shot out from Han Li's sleeve, and the Jingyan Tongzi appeared.

"In the next few hundred years, I have a crucial task to complete, and I may need your help. From today on, you will remain here and cultivate, refining the white fire bead. As for your lost vitality, I will find a way to restore it," Han Li said to the Jingyan Tongzi.

The Jingyan Tongzi looked at Han Li with a tilted head, nodded, and flew to a corner of the Flower Petal Space.

Its body transformed into a silver fireball, and the white fire bead rotated within, emitting powerful fire law fluctuations.

Han Li smiled, pleased with the sight, and turned to look at the distant pavilion.

The pavilion was quiet, with only the faint sound of ghostly wails, as Aiping continued to cultivate in seclusion, unaware of when he would awaken.

Han Li quickly withdrew his gaze and did not continue cultivating. Instead, he retrieved a small jade plate, inscribed with a complex array diagram, which was the Guangyin Tiandao Great Array.

After returning from the Zhenyan Gate, Han Li had feared that he would forget the array, so he had inscribed it on the jade plate.

He still had many tasks to complete, including comprehending the Tongtian Sword Array, cultivating the "Reversal of the True Wheel" and "Law of Heaven and Earth" temporal divinities, and breaking through to the Great Luo Realm.

Time was running out, and if he could set up a temporal difference space like the Zhenyan Gate, all his problems would be solved.

Although there was still a crucial issue to be resolved, Han Li decided to start setting up the array first.
