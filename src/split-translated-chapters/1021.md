Time Domain!

Dongfang Bai's eyes swept around, and his heart trembled.

The next moment, he silently retracted the blue Time Domain, grabbed Tao Ji and Lü Yun, and their figures burst forth, shooting towards the high sky.

The lake water, now free from the Time Domain's constraints, immediately rolled back and surged towards the center.

Dongfang Bai and the other two were surrounded by a dazzling blue glow, which violently clashed with the golden Time Domain. Astonishingly, it neutralized most of the Time Domain's power, allowing them to escape at a speed that was hardly affected.

"You think you can escape today?" Han Li bellowed, his body's true wheel reversing instantly. His figure flashed, and he reappeared above the three.

Dongfang Bai saw this and a hint of ruthlessness flashed in his eyes. He slapped Tao Ji and Lü Yun's backs, sending them flying towards Han Li above and Xiuhun below.

Tao Ji and Lü Yun were shocked, realizing they couldn't move or even speak.

Han Li saw Tao Ji hurtling towards him and raised his palm to strike. However, Tao Ji suddenly discovered his abdomen had rapidly inflated, and a small, green sprout had grown from his navel.

Before Han Li's palm could touch him, a deafening explosion occurred.

Tao Ji's abdomen had swollen to its limit and burst apart, releasing a massive amount of energy that sent Han Li flying backward, his outstretched hand now bloodied and mangled.

However, Han Li didn't have time to tend to his wounds, as Lü Yun was now hurtling towards Xiuhun.

Han Li reversed his true wheel, unleashing the power of the Lei Peng, and his figure shot into the lake like a bolt of lightning. He grabbed the exhausted Xiuhun and, before he could escape, heard a thunderous explosion behind him.

The sound of the explosion shook the three lakes, causing the underwater mountains and waterfalls to shatter and erupt in a massive wave that reached thousands of feet high, flooding the nearby Shuzi Mountain.

After a while, two figures emerged from the lake, hovering in mid-air.

"Master, Dongfang Bai is truly cunning and ruthless. To escape, he didn't hesitate to sacrifice his companions!" Xiuhun said, her face pale with anger.

"The fact that someone with such a wicked heart is in charge of a domain is a testament to the corruption within the Heavenly Court. However, it's of no consequence. You can't escape forever; debts will always be repaid." Han Li shook his head, speaking slowly.

"Master, what do you plan to do now?" Xiuhun asked, looking at Han Li.

"I'll take care of it. For now, rest and recover." Han Li waved his hand, opening the Huazhi Cave Heaven, and let Xiuhun return to rest.

Then, his figure vanished into the sky.

...

At the western end of the Jin Yuan mountain range, a series of palaces stretched across the mountains, peaks, and even floated in mid-air, as far as the eye could see.

Rainbow-colored bridges connected the various palaces, and the sky was filled with auspicious clouds and flying cranes, creating a breathtaking landscape.

This was the Jin Yuan Immortal Palace.

A green light appeared in the distance, shooting towards the palace at an incredible speed. In an instant, it arrived, and Dongfang Bai's figure emerged, continuing towards the palace's inner depths.

His face was gloomy, like a stormy sky, and his expression was unsightly. The palace's personnel bowed and greeted him, but dared not speak further.

Dongfang Bai soon arrived at the grand hall where the golden transmission circle was located. He took out the purple token, hesitated for a moment, and then placed it on the circle, pointing at it with his fingers.

A dazzling purple light emanated from the token, turning the surrounding golden array purple, and it began to flash rapidly.

A moment later, a figure appeared within the array – a woman with green hair, looking like a 16- or 17-year-old girl with a pale complexion, as if she were a frail, sheltered noblewoman. However, her eyes exuded boundless majesty.
Dongfang Bai, what's the matter that you've used the Nine Yuan Command to activate the Tian Luo Formation and contact me? If those people from the Qing Tian Monitoring find out, it'll be another trouble.

Miao Fa Xian Zun, I've just received some news regarding the Chaos Crystal Grain, I didn't dare to delay even for a moment, so I used the Nine Yuan Command to report to you immediately, please forgive me.

What?! You've found a lead on the Chaos Crystal Grain?! Tell me everything, don't leave out a single word!

Dongfang Bai's clothes fluttered in the windless air, his heart skipped a beat, and he quickly composed himself before reporting the matter of Han Li and the Palms of Heaven Bottle.

The origin of this matter was related to the Tao brothers, but in Dongfang Bai's words, it was as if he had discovered a clue beforehand and sent people to investigate. Anyway, the two brothers were already dead, and there was no evidence to prove otherwise.

The crystal grain is indeed likely to be the Chaos Crystal Grain! Good, great, the Palms of Heaven Bottle has finally reappeared in the True Immortal Realm!

Before Dongfang Bai could catch his breath, Miao Fa Xian Zun's eyes flashed with a cold light, and she said in a cold tone:

But you've already discovered this matter, why didn't you report it earlier?

I'm guilty! I was greedy for merit and wanted to capture Han Li, take the Palms of Heaven Bottle, and present it to you, but I didn't expect him to be so powerful. I gathered all the power of the Jinyuan Xian Palace, but we were still no match for him. Please punish me!

Dongfang Bai knelt down, his face filled with shock and fear, but his eyes revealed a hint of calmness.

He didn't try to cover up his mistakes, as the matter of Han Li had already spread, and it was better to admit his fault.

Miao Fa Xian Zun's expression turned displeased, and she asked:

Where is Han Li now?

Dongfang Bai quickly replied:

I've sent people to investigate his whereabouts, but we haven't received any news yet. However, I've already ordered the closure of all transmission formations in the Jinyuan Xian Domain, so he must still be in the Jinyuan Mountain Range.

Miao Fa Xian Zun's expression softened, and she said:

You've done well. You've discovered the lead on the Chaos Crystal Grain, and your merit is not small. However, you hid this matter and didn't report it in time, and you took action on your own, which led to Han Li being on guard. Your fault is not light. Now, your merit and fault cancel each other out, and your future performance will determine your punishment. If you can capture Han Li and retrieve the Palms of Heaven Bottle, your previous mistakes will be forgiven, and I will personally reward you. But if you let him escape the Jinyuan Xian Domain, the consequences will be severe.

Dongfang Bai's face tightened, and he said:

Yes, I understand. But with Han Li's strength, I'm afraid the Jinyuan Xian Palace alone is not enough...

Miao Fa Xian Zun's expression turned serious, and she said:

Don't worry, I'll send the Lan siblings from the Jinhuan Xian Palace to assist you. You must be more careful this time and not alarm Han Li.

Dongfang Bai's face lit up with joy, as he had heard of the Lan siblings' reputation.

Although they were only in the Taiyi Later Period, they had a secret technique that allowed them to merge their cultivation for a short time, reaching the Great Luo Realm. They had once fought a Great Luo from the Wheel of Reincarnation for three days and three nights without losing, and their reputation had spread far and wide.

Even if Han Li was powerful, with the Lan siblings' help, it would be like having two Great Luo Realm cultivators fighting against him, and he would not be a match.

Dongfang Bai's heart was filled with determination.

Miao Fa Xian Zun reminded him a few more times before ending the conversation, and her figure disappeared from the formation.

Dongfang Bai's face relaxed, and he let out a long sigh before stopping the formation and retrieving the purple command token. The formation returned to its original state.

In a pink palace within the Heavenly Court, a girl with green hair sat on a bed, surrounded by a soft, pink glow that gave off a gentle, feminine atmosphere.

A large, yellow toad sat beside the bed, its body covered in rough, hard bumps, and six copper bell-sized eyes on its face. Although it was motionless, its aura was extremely powerful, almost rivaling Miao Fa Xian Zun's.

The yellow toad spoke in a human-like voice:

Congratulations, Master, you've found a lead on the Chaos Crystal Grain. If you can retrieve the Palms of Heaven Bottle, the Nine Yuan Ancestor will surely look at you differently, and the position of Deputy Observer will be yours for the taking.

Miao Fa Xian Zun replied calmly:

I'm not interested in the position of Deputy Observer, I just hope to use this merit to ask the Observer for guidance and help me overcome the second corpse.

The yellow toad nodded and said:

You're right, Master, no matter what, strength is the most important thing.

Miao Fa Xian Zun ordered the yellow toad:

Pass on my orders to the Jinhuan Xian Palace, and you also go to the Jinyuan Xian Domain.
