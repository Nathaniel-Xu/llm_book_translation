Han Li slowly said, "The Gray Boundary is trying to stabilize its foothold, establish a foundation for its future expansion. As for the Heavenly Court... on one hand, it's to ensure the Bodhi Banquet proceeds smoothly and maintain a stable surface, with everything revolving around the Bodhi Banquet. On the other hand, there's also the matter of the Wheel of Rebirth Hall, which currently poses the greatest threat to the Heavenly Court."

Zi Ling sighed, "It's a pity for the countless beings in the occupied immortal realms..."

Han Li said, "Let's go, we don't have much time."

With that, the two flew off, transforming into a streak of light as they left the Ancient Cloud Continent, speeding towards the Wasteland Continent.

As they entered the ocean, the water's color deepened, gradually changing from a blue-green hue to a dark purple. The sea's surface was turbulent, with waves crashing against each other, creating a deafening roar.

The sky above was shrouded in a thick layer of dark clouds, which seemed to stretch on forever. The distance between the clouds and the sea's surface was only about 70-80 zhang.

Suddenly, a loud rumble shook the air, and a bolt of lightning illuminated the dark clouds. The lightning's power was so great that it seemed to split the clouds apart, striking the sea's surface with incredible force.

Han Li could feel the electricity in the air, even before they entered the Thunder Sea. The Gray Boundary's mist didn't dare approach this area.

"You return to the Flower Petal Cave Heaven and wait for me. The commotion here will be intense soon," Han Li said, gazing out at the Thunder Sea.

Zi Ling nodded and disappeared into the cave heaven.

Han Li didn't continue flying, instead summoning the 72 Qingtian Bee Cloud Swords. He leaped into the air, landing on one of the swords, and began to ride the wind.

The other 71 swords surrounded him, forming a protective sword array that shielded him from harm.

Han Li's gaze locked onto the Thunder Sea, and he charged forward, his swords at the ready.

As soon as he entered the Thunder Sea, a massive purple lightning bolt struck down from the heavens, targeting Han Li. He didn't even glance at it, and one of his Qingtian Bee Cloud Swords automatically intercepted the attack.

The lightning struck the sword, causing it to shudder and emit a metallic ringing sound. The sword's surface erupted with purple electricity, which spread out like a web.

Han Li's speed didn't increase, but instead slowed down, as if he was being hindered by the lightning. His swords continued to take turns deflecting the lightning bolts, each one striking the sea's surface with incredible force.

As the lightning continued to strike, the Qingtian Bee Cloud Swords began to exhibit a network of fine, electric lines on their surfaces.

"Indeed," Han Li said to himself, a smile spreading across his face.

The deeper they delved into the Thunder Sea, the more intense the lightning became. The electricity in the air grew stronger, and the Qingtian Bee Cloud Swords began to work together to deflect the attacks.

The swords no longer took turns, but instead formed a protective barrier around Han Li, shielding him from the lightning.

As they journeyed deeper into the Thunder Sea, they encountered increasingly powerful lightning bolts, which threatened to engulf them. Han Li and his swords persevered, eventually emerging from the Thunder Sea after more than half a month.

The Qingtian Bee Cloud Swords had grown stronger, their electric lines more pronounced.

Suddenly, a massive golden lightning bolt struck down from the heavens, followed by hundreds more, which descended like a golden waterfall. The Qingtian Bee Cloud Swords flew out, forming a bridge-like structure above Han Li's head.

The golden lightning bolts struck the swords, causing them to shudder and emit a deafening crackling sound. The swords' surfaces erupted with golden electricity, which spread out like a web.

The Qingtian Bee Cloud Swords now seemed to be imbued with the power of the lightning, their electric lines pulsing with an otherworldly energy. They appeared to be no longer ordinary swords, but rather, they seemed to be imbued with the power of the heavens.

Han Li stood beneath the "sword bridge," gazing out at the sea ahead, his eyes calm and serene.
In the void, a massive black vortex suddenly appeared.

Inside the vortex, a blurry shadow was visible, disrupted by the residual lightning and thunder, making it impossible to see clearly.

But Han Li's heart was clear about what it was.

He raised his hand and swept his sleeve, and the void in front of him condensed, and all the golden lightning threads and turbulent lightning waves were easily swept aside.

In the black vortex, a massive eye finally appeared.

Han Li's heart tightened, and he recalled the scene when he first saw this "Lightning Eye" years ago.

In his memory, the eye was only a few hundred meters in size, with a orange-yellow color, and a thin, long line on the pupil, shining with cold light.

At that time, he was only able to glance at it, and was struck by a terrifying aura, causing his soul to suffer significant damage.

With his current level of spiritual power, he was unable to see the true appearance behind the eye, and had even guessed that it was a massive beast lurking in the void.

Now, he was facing this terrifying eye once again, and his power had long surpassed his previous weakness. Yet, as he gazed at the eye, his heart still trembled with fear.

It turned out that he had guessed that the massive eye was not connected to a body, and that the black vortex only contained this solitary eye.

As he stared at the eye, the orange-yellow eye slowly turned towards him, and a loud thunderclap echoed in Han Li's mind.

His spiritual sea was suddenly torn apart, and a massive gash appeared, causing him to feel as if his head was about to split open. The impact was thousands of times stronger than before.

However, in the next instant, a faint glow spread through Han Li's spiritual sea, instantly healing the gash, and calming the turbulent waves.

Now, his Seven Volumes of the Refining God Technique had been fully cultivated, and his spiritual power was far beyond what it was before.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and the Five Elements Fantastical World Technique began to circulate within him. A round moon rose into the air, shining with a brilliant golden light, and the True Speech Treasure Wheel appeared.

In the center of the wheel, a massive golden vertical eye was suspended, its eyelids tightly closed.

"Today, I will see what you truly are," Han Li said, staring at the orange-yellow eye.

As he spoke, he activated the True Eye, and the wheel's intricate patterns began to glow. The golden eye's eyelids slowly opened, revealing a golden eyeball.

A soft golden light shot out from the pupil, and Han Li's spiritual energy began to move, no longer using his own eyes to see, but instead using the golden vertical eye.

The massive eye above him began to glow with golden threads, which intertwined with each other, gradually revealing its true shape.

Han Li's eyebrows rose, and he was shocked.

The reconstituted shape had the body of a cow, but with dragon horns on its head, and its massive body was covered in ancient, mysterious symbols. Its belly was round, and it had only one thick leg, with a long tail behind it.

"Is this not the 'Lei Kui'?" Han Li muttered to himself.

Han Li was not unfamiliar with the Lei Kui, and had even used its true pattern to inscribe symbols on his own magic soldiers. He had never imagined that the massive eye in the thunderstorm ocean was a relic of the Lei Kui.

However, as he looked closer, he discovered that the symbols on the Lei Kui's body were different from those he had seen before. They were a type of pattern that contained the true essence of lightning, which was not something that an ordinary Lei Kui could possess.

Han Li's thoughts moved, and the power of the Time Law surged out from his body, pouring into the True Eye.

The golden eyeball began to rotate rapidly, and the golden light emanating from it grew thicker.

In an instant, the flow of time in the entire thunderstorm ocean was interrupted, and the void seemed to freeze. Only the Lei Kui's shadow began to move.

The light and shadows shifted, and massive lightning pillars appeared in the nine heavens, as if the gates of heaven had opened. Thousands of lightning threads flowed out, striking the Lei Kui's body.

Its seemingly indestructible body began to disintegrate, turning into a brilliant flow of light that flew into the heavenly gates.

However, the Lei Kui seemed to be unwilling to give up, and let out a silent roar, as its body was torn in two by the lightning threads. One half was swallowed by the heavenly gates, while the other half surged towards its left eye.

Until its entire body was reduced to ashes, dispersing into the heavens, leaving behind only the solitary orange-yellow eye, suspended in the void.
