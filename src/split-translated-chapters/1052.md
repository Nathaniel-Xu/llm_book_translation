“Then I don't know, I just think this skeleton is a bit strange, so I'll let Master take a look.” Qiuhun shook her head and said.

Han Li nodded, looking at the skeleton, and fell into a thoughtful silence.

At this moment, he suddenly turned his head and looked back.

“Su Zhongyan, Jing Liu, they're here, Qiuhun, hide in the flower branch space, don't let them discover you.” Han Li's eyes flashed, and he immediately waved his hand to open the entrance to the flower branch space.

Qiuhun responded with a sound, turned around and flew inside.

As for Han Li, he immediately rose into the air and flew in a certain direction.

A moment later, the horizon behind him revealed a series of colorful escape lights, their direction slightly deviating from Han Li's.

Han Li looked at the escape lights and immediately went to meet them.

The escape lights also immediately changed direction, flying towards him, and the two sides quickly met.

Han Li stopped in mid-air, and the escape lights landed nearby, their colors flashing before revealing Su Zhongyan, Jing Liu, and others, only thirty or forty people, fewer than before.

However, the likes of Fu Gu and other Taiyi realm existences were still present, but these people were almost all injured, looking quite disheveled.

Han Li's mind moved, and he immediately guessed some of their experiences.

"I remember you're the stone friend by Yu's side, you're actually still alive? How come you're the only one, what about the others?" Su Zhongyan looked at Han Li and asked.

"We encountered many metal beasts behind the Golden Gate, Yu and the others all died at the mouths of those metal beasts, I and a few other friends escaped by chance, but later got separated. Su friend, Jing friend, it's great to have met you." Han Li looked like he was still shaken.

The others, although they had some premonitions, heard this and still looked solemn.

"You're really lucky." Jing Liu saw Han Li's timid appearance and a hint of disdain flashed in his eyes, coldly mocking him.

"Friend, you're absolutely right, I'm lucky, otherwise I would have died at the mouths of those metal beasts too." Han Li seemed to not have noticed Jing Liu's mockery, and nodded in agreement.

Jing Liu was taken aback, glared at Han Li, and didn't continue with the mocking words, instead asking: "Shi Mu, your group entered the Golden Gate first, there should be some treasures inside, what kind of treasures were they? Who do they belong to now?"

As he spoke, a hot light flashed in his eyes.

"Ah, the Golden Gate was empty, there were no treasures. And as soon as we entered, we were attacked by metal beasts, we barely escaped, and didn't get anything." Han Li was taken aback, and immediately shook his head.

"Is that so?" Jing Liu's eyebrows rose, clearly doubting Han Li's words.

"Jing friend, we previously agreed that the treasures obtained inside the Golden Gate would belong to each individual, you're pressuring him, isn't that unfair?" Fu Gu suddenly spoke up.

"Fu Gu, don't misunderstand, Jing isn't trying to rob others of their treasures, I just want to make a deal with this stone friend, since there's nothing inside, then forget it." Jing Liu laughed.

"If you want to make a deal, let's talk about it after we leave this Years Tower. Stone friend, you arrived at the second layer before us, have you discovered anything?" Su Zhongyan looked at Jing Liu, then asked Han Li.

"Nothing, I've been wandering around here for half a day, and only found sand." Han Li shook his head.

"Since that's the case, let's continue to explore." Su Zhongyan furrowed her brows, then said.

The others didn't have any objections, and the group didn't linger, continuing to fly forward.

In the blink of an eye, half a day had passed.

The desert below finally showed some changes, with large stone blocks emerging, and a series of short mountains appeared in the distance.

As they flew forward, the more they went, the more of those strange, weathered skeletons appeared on the ground.

Han Li trailed behind the group, his eyes flashing, and his heart growing increasingly uneasy.

Su Zhongyan and the others also noticed the skeletons on the ground, but they thought they were just ordinary corpses, and didn't pay much attention.

As they flew, a loud rumbling sound came from the front, at first very faint, but after a few breaths, it became deafening.

"What's going on!"

Su Zhongyan and the others stopped in mid-air, their divine senses probing forward, and their faces turned pale.

Just now, they had sensed a massive, dark red cloud appearing in the distance, rapidly pressing down on them.

The dark red cloud was filled with countless, grain-sized, dark red insects, their bodies burning with tiny, red flames, densely packed, and unknown in number.

"This is the fire years cicada!" Han Li quickly recognized the true form of the red cloud, the same fire years cicada he had encountered in the True Speech Sect's forbidden land, and was greatly shocked.
Han Li finally understood the origin of the skeletal remains, which were killed by the fire-age glowworms, explaining why the erosion was so severe.

Without hesitation, Han Li turned into a golden rainbow and flew away in the distance.

During the day at the True Speech Sect, Chi Rong released nearly ten thousand fire-age glowworms, which had already caused chaos among them. The number of glowworms present was unknown, but it was clear that they were vastly outnumbered.

Others, although unfamiliar with the fire-age glowworms, were shocked by the massive red cloud of worms and immediately turned to flee.

Among them was Jin Liu, who sneered at Han Li's cowardice, fleeing in the rear.

The fire-age glowworms seemed to sense the presence of Han Li and the others, emitting a deafening hum and excited chirping, like sharks smelling blood, as they chased after the group.

The worm cloud moved at an incredible speed, unaffected by the time restrictions of the area. Despite the group's full-speed retreat, they were slowly closing in.

The few scattered Golden Immortals flying in the rear were quickly caught up by the worm cloud.

"What kind of ghostly insects are these? I don't believe they're that powerful!" a red-faced man shouted, stopping in his tracks.

His body flashed with a crimson glow as he ignited a massive flame, covering a radius of several hundred meters, forming a sea of red golden fire.

A wave of intense heat emanated from the flames, causing the surrounding air to violently tremble, as if it were about to be ignited.

The red-faced man spat out a mouthful of fire, which expanded into a massive wave, engulfing thousands of fire-age glowworms.

The flames rolled, causing the engulfed worms to writhe and sizzle, while the surrounding worms were thrown into chaos.

The red-faced man's face lit up with a hint of joy, but it was short-lived, disappearing in an instant.

The worms, despite being engulfed by the flames, quickly regained their composure, spreading their wings and flying towards the red-faced man, unharmed.

The man's face contorted in shock and anger, shouting as he summoned a fiery red scroll, emitting a powerful flame aura.

He rapidly incanted a series of spells, imbuing the scroll with his energy.

The scroll burst into a brilliant flame, shielding the red-faced man's body.

The next moment, the worms swarmed, covering the man and the flame shield, forming a massive cocoon.

The worms then flew down, striking the flame shield, their dark red flames burning fiercely, merging with the shield.

The shield flashed brightly, then rapidly shrunk, disappearing in an instant, leaving behind the scroll, now worn and cracked, devoid of its former spiritual energy.

The worms then swarmed, covering the red-faced man, who was now helpless, his protective flames ineffective against the worms.

The man's face, once radiant, rapidly aged, his skin wrinkling, his hair turning white.

In an instant, the man transformed into a desiccated corpse, his clothes rotting, as he fell to the ground.

The worms lost interest in him, focusing on the others, who were soon caught up in the swarm.

The few remaining people were quickly overwhelmed, their screams silenced.

"Fire-age glowworms! I remember now, those worms possess time law, spewing out flames that burn the lifespan of other living beings! Wherever they pass, nothing remains, they're incredibly terrifying, and there are so many here!" Jin Liu exclaimed, his body trembling.

The others, hearing this, turned pale, each using their speed-boosting techniques, increasing their velocity by two or three times, fleeing forward, keeping pace with the swarm.

"Fire-age glowworms are extremely sensitive to blood and flesh auras, conceal your bodies and fly to the side, avoiding the swarm's front!" Su Zhenqi advised.

The others quickly hid their auras, flying to the left, trying to evade the swarm.

Han Li, hearing this, revealed a hint of surprise, immediately using the "Wan Kong Xu Ji" technique to conceal his aura.

The worms, momentarily confused, lost their sense of direction, failing to pursue Han Li and the others.

The group breathed a sigh of relief, but the memory of the red-faced man's fate kept them vigilant, continuing to flee with all their might.
