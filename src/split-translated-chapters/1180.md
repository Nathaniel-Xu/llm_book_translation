It seems that Luo and You Tian Kunpeng, the two True Spirit Kings, still have no intention of returning to the Savage Lands. Li Qi Ma sighed as he gazed at the scene before him.

"Why haven't they, like Bai Ze, stayed in the Savage Lands?" Han Li asked.

"Luo and You Tian Kunpeng are both free-spirited individuals who have always wandered through the numerous heavens and realms, and I've never seen their true forms. Now that the Spirit Realm is in turmoil and the Savage Lands are in a state of upheaval, I hope they'll return soon and help my father revive the Savage Lands." Li Qi Ma sighed.

Han Li nodded, but remained silent.

As the five True Spirit Kings' virtual shadows coalesced, including the Nine-Tailed Spirit Fox, Bai Ze stopped stimulating the Savage Lands' fire, and the several split bodies descended to the ground, merging into one.

"The five True Spirit Kings' bloodline powers have been summoned, although they're not complete, I believe they're sufficient for use. You five tribes should quickly choose your successors and merge the five True Spirit Kings' bloodlines." Bai Ze said.

"Thank you, Your Majesty!" Qing Yuan, Zhuo Wu, and the others from the five tribes stood up, bowing in gratitude.

Today's success in summoning the five True Spirit Kings' bloodlines was all thanks to Bai Ze's assistance. Otherwise, relying solely on their blood arrays would not have been enough to spread far.

Bai Ze waved his hand casually and walked towards the Hun and Lei Peng tribes.

The five tribes had already chosen their successors.

Qing Yuan, Zhuo Wu, and the others from the three tribes, including the young white-haired youth, flew out and landed beside the True Spirit Kings' bloodline, sitting cross-legged in the air as they began to merge the bloodlines.

The Mò Yǎn Pí Xiū tribe only had one person, so there was no need for discussion.

As for the Tian Hu tribe, Liu Le'er emerged from the crowd, surrounded by the envious gazes of the other Tian Hu youths, and flew down to the Nine-Tailed Spirit Fox's bloodline, about to begin merging.

"Wait!" a voice interrupted from outside.

Before the voice had faded, a grey-white light flashed, and a figure appeared beside the Tian Hu tribe, revealing a middle-aged man in a grey robe.

The man's features were refined, but his expression was always shrouded in a cold, dark aura, as if veiled by a shadow.

"Who is this?" the people from the various tribes exclaimed, their faces shocked, as many of them shouted in anger.

Inheriting the True Spirit Kings' bloodline was an extremely important matter for the tribes of the Savage Lands.

Now that the entire Ba Huang Mountain was surrounded by the tribes, and the Shi Luo Blood Gate had set up a network of restrictions to prevent the ceremony from being disrupted, it was unclear how this person had managed to intrude.

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise as he gazed at the newcomer.

The grey-robed middle-aged man's appearance was familiar, and he was actually Liu Zi Yang.

"No, he's not Liu Zi Yang, although his appearance is similar, his aura is different." Han Li's eyes flashed as he shook his head.

The grey-robed middle-aged man gave off a cold, dark aura, vastly different from Liu Zi Yang's.

Moreover, this person seemed familiar to Han Li, as if he had seen him before.

"It's him!" Li Qi Ma's eyes narrowed, as if he recognized the grey-robed middle-aged man.

The Tian Hu tribe's members, however, looked at the grey-robed middle-aged man with shock and awe, as if they had seen a ghost.

"Gentlemen, I am Liu, also a member of the Tian Hu tribe. I've come today to compete for the inheritance of the Nine-Tailed Spirit Fox's True Spirit King bloodline, not to cause trouble. If I've caused any inconvenience, please forgive me." The grey-robed middle-aged man bowed, his hands clasped together, as a grey-white light enveloped him.

A pure and powerful Tian Hu bloodline aura burst forth from his body, causing the surrounding space to distort and tremble violently.

The Tian Hu tribe's members stumbled backward, their faces pale, except for Liu Qing and the two middle-aged men beside him, who managed to stand firm.

Liu Le'er, who was floating in mid-air, was also affected by the aura and was blown backward, her face pale.

Just then, a figure flashed beside her, and Han Li appeared, supporting Liu Le'er and releasing a golden light that formed a protective barrier in front of them, shielding them from the intense aura.

Liu Le'er breathed a sigh of relief and thanked Han Li.

Han Li ignored Liu Le'er and gazed at the grey-robed middle-aged man, his eyes narrowing.

This person's cultivation had reached the peak of the Da Luo realm, and was not inferior to the Black Sky Demon Ancestor's. In fact, he seemed even stronger.

"This person's strength is too great, we can't match him. Let's retreat for now." Han Li thought to himself and transmitted a message to Liu Le'er.

Liu Le'er naturally had no objections and retreated with Han Li.

As they flew backward, Han Li glanced at the Hun and Lei Peng tribes, where Bai Ze was standing, watching the grey-robed middle-aged man with a calm expression, as if he were an outsider.
The people of the various tribes in the Blood-colored Space, including the few clan leaders, felt the aura of the gray-robed middle-aged man, and their expressions changed. The people who had been scolding the gray-robed middle-aged man closed their mouths and retreated quietly.

The Tian Huo tribe quickly stabilized their formation, and among them, Liu Qing glanced at Bai Ze with a sidelong glance. Seeing that Bai Ze was standing still, Liu Qing's eyebrows furrowed slightly, but he immediately returned to normal and waved his hand to let the people beside him go to protect Liu Le'er.

Liu Qing had seen Han Li protecting Liu Le'er earlier, and he didn't question Han Li's good intentions towards Liu Le'er, so he didn't stop him.

Three Tian Huo tribe members appeared around Han Li and Liu Le'er, including Huo San, Mu Changlao, and a black-faced old man, Tai Yi. "Han Dao friend, thank you for protecting Miss Le'er in the critical moment," Huo San said with a bow.

The black-faced old man also thanked him, and Mu Changlao, although unwilling, also bowed his head.

"Le'er is not an outsider to me, I should have done so, Liu Dao friend doesn't need to be polite," Han Li said, scanning Mu Changlao with a glance before turning to Huo San.

"Since we parted ways last time, Han Dao friend's strength has made great progress, especially in the face of so many powerful people, your spirit is not affected at all, it's truly admirable," Huo San said with a sigh.

Han Li heard this and glanced at Liu Le'er, Huo San, the black-faced old man, and the other Tai Yi realm existences, and his heart moved.

At this moment, the many Da Luo existences in the Blood-colored Space were releasing their auras, and the gray-robed middle-aged man was trying to resist, filling the entire Blood-colored Space with a terrifying pressure. Liu Le'er, Huo San, and the other Tai Yi realm existences were maintaining a calm face, but their souls were constantly trembling.

This was the suppression of the Da Luo realm, a natural suppression of the Tai Yi realm.

Advancing from the Tai Yi realm to the Da Luo realm required not only a breakthrough in cultivation, but also a great transformation of the soul, and the beginning of fusion with the physical body.

Every move of a Da Luo realm cultivator would carry the overwhelming power of their soul.

Therefore, Tai Yi realm cultivators facing Da Luo realm cultivators would often be unable to move, and would lose 90% of the time before even starting.

Han Li had previously felt the pressure of the Da Luo realm existences, but he had cultivated the Lian Shen technique, and his soul was much stronger than that of ordinary Tai Yi realm cultivators, so the pressure was much smaller. This was why he could resist those Da Luo realm existences and even win with the power of time.

However, at this moment, he seemed to be completely unaffected by the pressure. This was why he was able to protect Liu Le'er before the Tian Huo tribe could react.

Han Li's eyebrows moved, but he quickly realized the reason.

Although his cultivation had not increased during this time, he had mastered the Sui Yue Shen Deng, and the time law crystals in his body had increased greatly. He had also comprehended the Tong Tian Sword Array and set up the Time Difference Space, and his confidence had grown. His spiritual realm had been growing steadily.

Unbeknownst to him, his soul had undergone a transformation, and the powerful soul of the Da Luo realm existences could no longer suppress him.

Han Li discovered the change in his soul and secretly rejoiced, but his face did not show it.

"Liu Dao friend is too kind, Han's strength is nothing compared to the Tian Huo tribe, let's see how Liu Qing retires the enemy," he said calmly.

Huo San's eyes flashed with a strange light, but he didn't continue to dwell on the matter and looked forward.

The Tian Huo tribe had recovered from their shock and were now staring at the gray-robed middle-aged man, facing off against him.

"Liu Tianhao, you did something like that back then, and now you dare to come to the Blood-colored Space, your courage is not small!" Liu Qing stepped forward, his eyes flashing with cold light.

"What are you talking about, Liu Qing Dao friend? Please clarify," Liu Tianhao said, unaffected by the killing intent in Liu Qing's words.

"You seem to have a poor memory, but that's okay, there's plenty of time for you to think in the underworld!" Liu Qing smiled coldly and waved his hand.

The Blood-colored Space around Liu Tianhao suddenly disappeared, and he was enveloped in a dark, starry sky. A massive star river appeared, rotating rapidly.

He seemed to be transported to the depths of the starry sky.

The star river suddenly expanded, filling the entire starry sky, and its rotation became fierce.

A terrifying power that could crush the starry sky emanated from the rotating star river, enveloping Liu Tianhao and threatening to tear his body apart.

At the same time, a hail of meteorites shot out from the star river, striking Liu Tianhao's body and sending him flying, his blood splattering everywhere.

"Hmm? Your cultivation of the Huan Jing Ling Yu is not bad, you've reached the realm of Huan Mo Sui Xin, but it's not enough to trap me," Liu Tianhao said, ignoring his injuries, his eyebrows raised.

He then made a hand seal, and a gray-white light appeared on his forehead.

The light split open, revealing a gray-white vertical eye, which shot out endless gray-white flames.

The flames emitted a pure and powerful illusory law, causing the starry sky to collapse wherever they touched.

In an instant, the surrounding starry sky was extinguished, and Liu Tianhao returned to the Blood-colored Space.

His injuries had also disappeared without a trace.
