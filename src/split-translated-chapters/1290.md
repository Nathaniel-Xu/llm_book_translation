Han Li nodded and said, "Since you've considered all aspects, I'll accompany you to take a look. We'll discuss other matters based on the actual situation."

Gui Wu's face lit up with joy, "Thank you, Han Dao friend. The Six Paths Reincarnation Disk is extremely extraordinary, and it will definitely be of great help to you."

Suddenly, Ti Huo interrupted, "Master, wait, there's something else we need to clarify."

Han Li nodded at Ti Huo, indicating for him to speak.

"Ti Huo Dao friend, what's on your mind? Please speak freely," Gui Wu said with a smile.

Ti Huo asked, "You said it appears every certain period of time, but how long is that? We can't stay in the Underworld for too long, and we'll have to leave soon."

Gui Wu's smile faded, and he said seriously, "Don't worry about that. The positive and negative whirlwinds appear quite frequently. According to my calculations, it will appear again in about a thousand years. The next occurrence is not far away, and it will happen within a hundred years."

Ti Huo continued, "Since the positive and negative whirlwinds are so powerful, won't the Six Paths Reincarnation Disk be affected?"

Gui Wu explained, "The Six Paths Reincarnation Disk is a natural treasure born in the Underworld, and it's a manifestation of the Heavenly Dao. It's extremely hard and unbreakable. Moreover, the Six Paths Reincarnation Disk and the positive and negative whirlwinds are related, so the whirlwinds won't affect the disk."

Jin Tong asked, "From here to the Yellow Spring Great Marsh, will we pass through many ghost tribe territories? What's the strength of those ghost tribes?"

Gui Wu replied, "We'll inevitably pass through some ghost tribes' territories, but with Han Li Dao friend's current strength, and with the two of you assisting, it won't be a problem. I'm familiar with the route, and I'll help you avoid some trouble."

The following time, Ti Huo and Jin Tong asked a few more questions, and Gui Wu patiently answered them, providing solutions to each problem. The two soon ran out of questions.

Han Li said, "Gui Wu Dao friend has indeed considered everything in great detail."

Gui Wu smiled, "Han Dao friend is too kind. If it weren't for the three of you assisting me, even if I considered everything, it would be useless."

Han Li smiled faintly but didn't say anything.

The three of them set off immediately, first walking away from the Lost Soul Cliff, then flying northwest according to Gui Wu's directions.

Ti Huo transmitted a message to Han Li, "Master, do you really believe what Gui Wu said? What if he's like that Blood Li, deceiving us?"

Han Li replied, "Can you sense whether his words are true or false?"

Ti Huo transmitted, "I couldn't. Although he's just a residual soul, his spiritual soul cultivation is quite high, just like Blood Li. I and Jin Tong tried to ask him questions, but we couldn't sense anything."

Han Li reassured, "Don't worry, you also said that Gui Wu is just a residual soul now. If he has any treacherous intentions, I'll handle him immediately. The Six Paths Reincarnation Disk is extremely valuable, and it's worth taking a risk."

Ti Huo heard Han Li's words and was taken aback, then nodded and didn't say anything.

The group flew for half a month, getting closer to the depths of the Underworld. More and more ghostly creatures began to appear.

These creatures either formed various tribes or lived in cities, unlike the chaotic situation in the Black River Domain.

Fortunately, with Gui Wu's guidance, they encountered no major obstacles, and the distance to the Yellow Spring Great Marsh grew shorter.

The three of them flew through the dark clouds, using the cloud energy to conceal their tracks.

Han Li flew forward, holding a thick book in his hand, flipping through it quickly.

This was something he had obtained by sneaking into a city they had passed through.

According to the book's contents, Gui Wu's words were mostly true.

Ti Huo suddenly spoke up, "Master, there's movement ahead. It seems like someone is fighting."

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he stopped in mid-air, putting away the book.

Ti Huo and Jin Tong also stopped, standing on either side of him.

Han Li asked, "Is there anything special about the fighting parties?"

Gui Wu appeared from the black box, saying, "Ah, it's interesting. There are outsiders in the Underworld, and they're from the Demon Domain."

Han Li glanced at Gui Wu, then looked at Ti Huo.

Ti Huo replied, "Yes, one of the fighting parties is from the Demon Domain."

Han Li asked Gui Wu, "Can you sense things from such a distance?"

Gui Wu said, "In the Underworld, as long as you can control your spiritual sense, sensing things from this distance is only natural. You're a human, and you're not familiar with spiritual sense control. Ti Huo, you're the reincarnation of the Underworld King, but you've forgotten even the basics of our ghost tribe's abilities. You only sensed the fighting from this distance?"

Ti Huo's expression changed, and she coldly replied, "I've said it before, I don't remember anything about being the Underworld King."

Gui Wu smiled faintly and looked away.

Han Li asked again, "How far can you sense things?"

Gui Wu didn't respond, and the group continued to observe the fighting from a distance.
I'm now only left with a wisp of residual soul, and can only sense a distance of about 130,000 miles. Gui Wu immediately replied.

Han Li heard this and was shocked, Gui Wu's range of perception was five or six times that of Ti Huan.

"We are now like ants on a string, Gui Wu's range of perception is so vast, from now on, we'll have to rely on Gui Wu to scout ahead." Han Li said.

"Of course, naturally," Gui Wu chuckled.

"Let's move forward, and see what's ahead." Han Li waved his hand.

The group continued on, and soon arrived at a mountain valley, hiding in a secluded spot outside the valley.

Ti Huan recited an incantation, and used the concealment technique he had just remembered, erasing their tracks.

Unfortunately, this technique couldn't be sustained for long, otherwise they would have been able to avoid a lot of trouble on their journey.

"This is the Ming Wang's Erased Tracks Spell! You must be the Ming Wang's reincarnation, no one else can comprehend this divine ability!" Gui Wu exclaimed.

"Ming Wang's Erased Tracks Spell? I don't know what you're talking about, I'm Ti Huan, not the Ming Wang." Ti Huan coldly snorted, ignoring Gui Wu.

Han Li heard Gui Wu's words, and his mind began to turn, but he quickly pushed the thought aside and looked towards the mountain valley.

The mountain valley was quite large, spanning about 20-30 miles, and was currently filled with countless dark shadows, forming a massive encirclement, howling incessantly.

These ghostly creatures were humanoid, with sheep-like heads, and stood about 4-5 zhang tall, covered in dense black fur, and surrounded by a black mist.

These sheep-headed ghost creatures held massive black curved blades, emitting a thick smoke-like black energy, and as they swung their blades, a wave of black misty blade lights shot out, striking the center of the encirclement.

The sheep-headed ghost creatures seemed to understand the art of battle formations, and coordinated with each other with great skill, their black misty blade lights forming a massive blade array, emitting a powerful and unmatched killing intent, like a lid covering the entire mountain valley.

"These are the Shang Yang Ghost Tribe, in the Yu Ming Three Realms, they're only considered mid-tier." Gui Wu said.

Han Li's gaze shifted, looking towards the center of the formation.

Through the waves of blade lights, he could faintly see two black-robed figures, one tall and one short, completely shrouded in black, their faces hidden.

Their black robes were not ordinary attire, imbued with a strange restrictive force, preventing divine sense from penetrating, making it impossible to see their faces.

The two figures were surrounded by four black flags, adorned with purple cloud patterns, revolving around them in a circular motion, forming a half-spherical purple protective barrier, resisting the encirclement's killing intent.

The four black flags were of high quality, forming a remarkably resilient purple barrier, which, despite trembling under the blade array's onslaught, did not immediately shatter.

"Indeed, they're two demons, with considerable cultivation, strange, what are these two demons doing here?" Han Li muttered to himself.

The two black-robed figures emitted pure and untainted demonic energy, the taller demon's energy was vast and powerful, having reached the Da Luo Realm.

The shorter demon, despite being shrouded in black, seemed to possess a slender and agile physique, clearly a female cultivator, with a slightly weaker cultivation, but still at the peak of the Tai Yi Realm.

Although the two demons were not weak, the surrounding sheep-headed ghost creatures were too numerous, and their individual strength was not weak, the two demons were firmly trapped within the blade array, unable to escape.

"Master, if we continue to hold out, these two might not be able to withstand it, should we rescue them?" Ti Huan asked.

Han Li heard this, and looked towards Gui Wu.

"Gui Wu, are there any powerful ghost tribes nearby, will attacking these Shang Yang Ghost Creatures stir up trouble?"

"The Shang Yang Ghost Tribe is not a top-tier ghost tribe in the Yan Luo Realm, but they are a subordinate tribe of the Ma Wang Ghost Tribe, one of the four major ghost tribes in the Yan Luo Realm. If you want to rescue them, you can, just be quick and decisive, rescue them and leave immediately, and you shouldn't stir up trouble." Gui Wu replied.

"Very well, Ti Huan, Jin Tong, you two break through the blade array, and rescue those two." Han Li said, his expression easing.

Ti Huan and Jin Tong acknowledged, and shot out.

Ti Huan's right hand grasped at the air, and a massive black claw appeared above the mountain valley, about the size of a small mountain, and swiped down at the blade array.

Jin Tong's body flashed with golden light, and he transformed into a house-sized Xi Jin Xian, his two front claws swiping down.

In a burst of ear-piercing, heaven-shaking shrieks, a massive sword-like energy shot out, instantly forming a sword mountain, which, combined with Ti Huan's massive claw, struck the blade array.

Due to Ti Huan's concealment technique, the sheep-headed ghost creatures had not detected their presence, and only reacted when the black claw and sword mountain descended, but it was already too late.

The black claw and golden sword mountain struck the blade array, producing a deafening "Boom" "Boom" sound!

The blade array shattered, but did not collapse.

A wave of black and golden light rippled out, crashing into the surrounding mountains, causing them to crumble and collapse.

A massive gust of wind swept up, rolling towards the surroundings, affecting an area of several hundred miles, stripping away a layer of earth.
