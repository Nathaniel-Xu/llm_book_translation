The entire Spiritual Sea space suddenly erupted into a cacophony of thunder and lightning, instantly filling the air with an intense and violent energy.

The Corpse and Han Li locked eyes, neither of them speaking a word, but instead charging at each other with a fierce battle cry.

As they clashed, the divided Spiritual Sea space descended into chaos, with both sides surging forward in a frenzy of energy.

A deafening crash shook the air!

Han Li and the Corpse exchanged blows, their movements straightforward and unadorned, yet filled with a deep-seated power.

As they collided, the two halves of the Spiritual Sea merged into one, their energies intertwining in a spectacular display.

Above, the blood clouds churned and boiled, lightning flashing through the air as the two forces clashed in a frenzy of energy.

Han Li felt his divine soul shudder, as if it was being torn apart, and he could only focus on frantically activating his cultivation technique, pouring all his spiritual energy into the battle.

"Don't you understand yet? The Spiritual Sea is already mine to command, and the more you rage, the stronger I become. Ha ha, let your anger burn brighter still!" the Corpse sneered, his voice dripping with contempt.

With a sudden burst of energy, the Corpse launched a powerful attack, his palms striking out with a force that shook the air.

The pressure from the half of the Spiritual Sea space bore down on Han Li, pushing him back despite his best efforts to resist.

As the Corpse's blood-red Spiritual Sea surged forward, it began to occupy the dominant position, its power growing with each passing moment.

Han Li's eyes widened in alarm as he realized the Corpse was slowly taking control of the Spiritual Sea space, threatening to supplant him as the true master.

If he lost, his divine soul would be cast out, forced to flee the Spiritual Sea like a stray dog.

Worse still, he would be completely absorbed and assimilated into the Corpse's being.

"Ha ha, you've lost... I'll take your place, and your name will echo throughout the entire Immortal Realm!" the Corpse cackled, his eyes gleaming with triumph.

Just as the Corpse was about to deliver the final blow, Han Li suddenly laughed coldly, his voice dripping with malice.

"You're celebrating too early, it's not a good habit."

In the next instant, a massive yin-yang fish diagram appeared beneath Han Li and the Corpse, its surface gleaming like a mirror as it supported the two combatants.

The Corpse's eyes widened in shock as he stared at the diagram, his face pale with fear.

"Impossible... how did you...?"

The yin-yang fish diagram suddenly burst into a brilliant display of black and white light, its energy swirling in a maddening dance.

"Cut!"

Han Li's eyes snapped shut, his voice booming out as he unleashed a devastating blow.

The Spiritual Sea space shuddered, its energy surging forward in a massive wave that crashed down on the Corpse.

As the two forces clashed, the divided Spiritual Sea space finally reunited, its energies merging into a single, unified whole.

At the same time, on the altar of the Heavenly Frost Island, Han Li's body, its seven apertures bleeding profusely, suddenly opened its eyes.

A dark, swirling energy burst forth from his eyes, only to be enveloped by a powerful, crystalline energy that wrapped around it like a shroud.

The dark energy seemed to resist, turning back to attack Han Li's brow, but was suddenly absorbed by the sun-fish's eye, its energy dissipating into the void.

The Corpse's body, now freed from its prison, let out a deafening roar as it struggled to regain control.

Its eyes blazed with fury, its face twisted in a snarl as it sat up, its hands grasping at its head in a futile attempt to regain mastery.

The air was filled with the sound of chanting, the Corpse's rage growing with each passing moment as it realized it was trapped in this new body, unable to control its actions.

Han Li, still seated across from the Corpse, his face smeared with blood, his body battered and bruised, yet his eyes shone with a fierce determination.

His eight hundred and forty spiritual apertures had been fully opened, his cultivation reaching the mid-stage of the Great Luo Realm.

However, the Corpse's departure had taken a significant portion of his spiritual energy, leaving him weakened and in need of time to recover.

"Don't say I didn't warn you, this body will take some time to master, so be patient."

Han Li's voice was calm, his eyes closing once more as he began to meditate.

The Corpse's face twisted in rage as it realized Han Li's plan, its eyes fixed on the chains that bound it to the body.

It knew it had to calm down, to focus on refining the body, but its anger and frustration threatened to consume it.

As the Corpse's energy flowed through the body, it began to change, its crystalline structure shifting towards a more human form.

The body's internal energy pathways began to open, its organs and meridians connecting in a complex network.

The Corpse's power surged through the body, its energy coursing through the veins like a river, as it began to take control of its new prison.
The Earth Immortal's corpse, whose chest had been slowly rising and falling, suddenly emitted a burst of vitality.

Han Li, who was sitting in meditation, had already split off a thread of his consciousness to monitor the changes in the Earth Immortal's corpse.

Upon seeing this, his heart tightened, and he couldn't help but wake up once again.

The degree of fusion between the evil corpse and the Earth Immortal's body far exceeded his original expectations, and the speed at which it was transforming was also causing him concern.

Just as he was about to pause his cultivation and operate the formation to suppress the evil corpse, a sudden change occurred.

The evil corpse, which was sitting opposite him, suddenly made the first move.

Its body was surrounded by a blue glow, and the original aura of the Corpse Qi had disappeared without a trace. Instead, a dense aura of water attribute laws was emanating from it.

The aura around its body was also rapidly increasing.

"Not good," Han Li muttered to himself, looking up at the golden light screen above him.

The golden light screen had been set up with Buddhist scriptures and mantras to suppress the Corpse Qi, but who would have thought that after the evil corpse merged with the Earth Immortal's body, it would completely suppress the Corpse Qi?

"Boom!"

A loud explosion sounded, and the blue light on the evil corpse's body intensified, creating a massive blue water wave that burst forth, directly shattering the chains that bound it.

The evil corpse's body was then lifted up by the blue water wave, which had transformed into a blue dragon, and it charged straight at the golden light screen.

"Hmm..."

A dull sound echoed, and the golden light screen did not collapse, but instead, the blue dragon dissipated, scattering water droplets everywhere.

"Where are you going?"

Han Li shouted, his five fingers curved like claws, reaching out to grab the evil corpse's ankle.

Just as he was about to grab it, the evil corpse's ankle suddenly flashed with blue light and transformed into water, flowing away.

Han Li's hand grasped at nothing, and he was about to grab again when a loud explosion sounded from above.

The golden light screen exploded, and the evil corpse's body burst forth, flying away from the altar and disappearing into the distance.

At that moment, a brilliant golden light illuminated the sky, and a seven-layered golden pagoda appeared, descending rapidly to encase the evil corpse.

Han Li's figure also flew out from the altar, chasing after the evil corpse.

However, before he could catch up, a loud rumbling sound echoed through the sky.

The golden pagoda's top burst open, revealing a massive black hole, and a dense black aura erupted from it, accompanied by a faintly visible black wheel.

Han Li's eyes widened, and his forehead bulged with veins. The evil corpse had self-destructed its Heavy Water True Wheel to escape.

"This time, I underestimated you. I'll take this body for now, and I'll come back to trouble you again in the future." A voice filled with resentment echoed from the sky.

A dark light shot down from the sky, piercing into the ocean and creating a massive wave.

Han Li's face darkened, and he quickly chased after the evil corpse.

Compared to the risks brought about by the instability of his own cultivation, allowing the evil corpse to escape his control would bring him unpredictable trouble in the future.

He was determined to catch the evil corpse at all costs, taking advantage of its current weakness to suppress it completely.

The events that had transpired, from the evil corpse breaking free from the isolation formation to being suppressed by Han Li, and then escaping again, had all occurred within the span of a single incense stick.

The Golden Boy and the Wailing Spirit, who were stationed at the north and south ends of the island, had not yet grasped the situation, and seeing this, they quickly followed Han Li in pursuit.

In the blink of an eye, Han Li had already chased after the evil corpse for a thousand miles, and when he looked around, he could no longer see any sign of it. He had to hover in mid-air, using his Refining Spirit Technique to track its trail.

"Uncle, what's going on? Did something go wrong with the beheading?" the Golden Boy asked as he caught up.

"The Earth Immortal's corpse has been eroded by the malicious intentions of countless people, including those who sought revenge. Its fusion with the evil corpse was far beyond my expectations, and it escaped. It's now hiding in the ocean, and my aura is unstable, making it difficult for me to use my Refining Spirit Technique to its full potential. I've lost its trail," Han Li explained, his face pale with concern.

At that moment, the Wailing Spirit, who had been chasing after them, pointed in a direction and shouted, "It's heading in that direction, and it's moving very fast. Should we..."

"Chase!" Han Li replied, quickly following the direction the Wailing Spirit had pointed.
