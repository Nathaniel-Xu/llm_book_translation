As soon as Han Li and Lan Yan passed through the restriction, a dark red glow suddenly shot out from the void outside the entrance of the Golden Jade Gate, and with incredible speed, it flew through the crack in the restriction and entered the inside.

"Not good, quickly close the exit!" Qi Lao's face changed, and he immediately activated the golden token.

A golden light shot out from the token and entered the restriction's light screen.

Almost at the same time, the other eight people also immediately activated the golden flags in their hands, and the exit of the golden light screen quickly closed.

At the same time, Qi Lao spat out two white glows, which transformed into two white giant swords, emitting a chilling aura. The surrounding void appeared to be frozen, with ice crystals floating in the air.

The white giant swords moved extremely quickly, creating a dense array of residual shadows, and in an instant, they caught up to the dark red glow.

However, the dark red glow suddenly brightened, and a series of dark red light waves shook out from within.

The two white giant swords, upon touching the dark red light waves, were immediately repelled, and the white light on the swords seemed to melt like ice and snow, quickly dispersing. The two giant swords were also directly blown away.

A red-robed girl's figure suddenly appeared within the dark red glow, her figure curvaceous and her features delicate. It was none other than Jiao San.

Lan Yan was also shocked by the sudden change, and he stared blankly at the scene before him.

However, Han Li's face remained calm, as if he had expected this all along.

Jiao San glanced in Han Li's direction, a faint smile flashing across her face, and then she raised her hand.

A silver light gate appeared from the void beside her, and a series of figures emerged from the gate, none other than the people of the Wheel of Reincarnation Palace. There were hundreds of them, and more were still emerging from the gate.

"Take control of the Golden Jade Gate!" Jiao San shouted.

The Wheel of Reincarnation Palace's people charged towards Qi Lao and the others, each emitting a variety of lights.

Qi Lao's eyes widened in anger, but he could only fight back.

Fortunately, the number of Nine Heavens Observatory disciples stationed at the Golden Jade Gate was numerous, with over a thousand people, giving them a numerical advantage.

In an instant, the two groups clashed, emitting a deafening roar.

"Let's go!" Han Li pulled Lan Yan, who was still in a daze, and flew towards the distance.

"Hehe, thank you, Han Dao friend, I will surely repay you once this task is complete." Jiao San's laughter echoed in Han Li's mind.

Han Li ignored her, pulling Lan Yan as they flew towards the front, quickly disappearing from view. No one noticed them.

"Han Dao friend, did you know that the Wheel of Reincarnation Palace's people would appear?" Lan Yan asked.

"Han Dao friend, sometimes it's better not to ask questions. Knowing too much won't do you any good." Han Li replied coldly, his mind racing.

It seemed that Jiao San had been secretly following them, knowing that he wanted to rescue Jin Tong, and would definitely go to the inner observatory. She had used them to sneak into the inner observatory and seize control of the Golden Jade Gate. What a clever plan. It seemed that the mask she had given him had some hidden purpose.

"Let's take this opportunity to rescue Jin Tong quickly. I'm familiar with the inner observatory's layout, I can guide you." Lan Yan said, trying to change the subject.

"According to my information, Jin Tong is being held in the inner observatory's Ghost Valley. Here's the map." Han Li said, taking out the map jade and handing it to Lan Yan.

"Ghost Valley? I've heard that's where the Ghost Spirit Master, one of the four great saints, cultivates." Lan Yan's face turned pale.

"Ghost Spirit Master's territory?" Han Li's brow furrowed, but he quickly relaxed.

Since Jin Tong was captured by the Ghost Spirit Master, it made sense that he would be held in the Ghost Spirit Master's own territory.

"Ghost Spirit Master's cultivation has reached the middle stage of the Great Luo Realm, and his ghostly cultivation method is extremely unusual. In terms of strength, he's considered the strongest among the four great saints. Although the Wheel of Reincarnation Palace's attack has occurred, he might not be in the Ghost Valley at the moment, but we should still be prepared for the worst." Lan Yan glanced at Han Li, warning him.

"Don't worry, I'm not underestimating the Ghost Spirit Master." Han Li smiled lightly, and then waved his hand.

A black energy emerged from his hand, enveloping the two of them.

Their figures disappeared in an instant, transforming into a formless shadow that flew rapidly towards the front.

Han Li's black mask could not only be used on himself, but also on those around him, as long as they were not too far away.

Lan Yan looked around, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes, but he quickly regained his composure and focused on guiding Han Li.

The inner observatory's buildings were fewer in number, and the natural scenery was more prominent. However, the heavenly energy here was much denser than the outer observatory.

Although the inner observatory had activated some restrictions, there were fewer than in the outer observatory. Perhaps the Nine Heavens Observatory people thought that the outer observatory's restrictions and the Golden Jade Gate's super array were already sufficient.

This made it easier for Han Li and Lan Yan to move quickly, and they flew rapidly towards the front.
After a long time, the two arrived at a mountain valley, quietly descending onto the ground.

The land and rocks surrounding the valley were pitch black, and a thick layer of dark clouds hung above, slowly drifting through the air like water clouds. The dark color was so intense that it seemed to contain a powerful poison.

A chill wind blew out of the valley, emitting a sharp, ear-piercing whine that rose and fell, causing one's heart to tremble with fear. Moreover, a violent and brutal intent seemed to churn within the wind, making the place seem like a realm of ghosts and demons.

Han Li and Lan Yan were still far away, yet they could feel the intense, malevolent energy emanating from the valley, as if countless cold steel needles were piercing their bodies.

Fortunately, the two had deep cultivation, and they could withstand it.

"Is this the Ghost Valley?" Han Li asked, scanning the area with his eyes.

"Yes, I've never been here before, but I've heard about it. The atmosphere is indeed eerie and foreboding, and the map indicated this place. It can't be wrong." Lan Yan replied confidently.

Han Li nodded, closing his eyes to try and sense the presence of the Golden Child.

After a long time, he opened his eyes, his brow furrowed in concern.

"Can't sense anything?" Lan Yan asked.

Han Li slightly nodded, his face somewhat gloomy.

He had been unable to sense the Golden Child's presence in the Golden City, possibly due to the distance. Now, being close by, he still couldn't sense it, which was quite strange.

Was the Golden Child sealed within a barrier that could block his senses? Or was the information from the Wheel of Reincarnation incorrect?

The mountain valley before them was filled with an intense, ghostly energy, making even Han Li feel apprehensive. Moreover, there might be a powerful ghost spirit, a mid-stage Mahayana cultivator, inside.

"Master, let's not rush into the Ghost Valley. First, let's confirm if the Golden Child is inside. The information from the Wheel of Reincarnation might not be accurate." Qiuhun's voice echoed in Han Li's mind.

Han Li slowly nodded.

"Master, release me. I've been with the senior for a long time, and we have a connection." Xiao Bai suddenly said.

"Very well." Han Li waved his hand, summoning Xiao Bai out of the flower petal space.

Xiao Bai closed her eyes, a faint white light surrounding her body. A misty, crystal-like light appeared on her forehead.

"No, I can't sense the senior's presence either." Xiao Bai opened her eyes, shaking her head.

Han Li wasn't too surprised, as the Golden Child was a spirit beast he had cultivated himself. If he couldn't sense it, Xiao Bai naturally couldn't either.

"Master, what do we do now?" Xiao Bai asked anxiously.

"No need to worry, we may not be able to sense the Golden Child, but there's someone who can." Han Li smiled slightly, then formed a hand seal.

The restrictions on the flower petal space's upper floor dissipated, and a figure flew out, landing on the ground. It was Qu Ling.

Han Li's hand moved again, directly summoning Qu Ling out of the flower petal space.

"Brother Han, Qu Ling and you are traveling together, but I'm not a prisoner to be locked up and restricted." Qu Ling's face was quite unsightly, glancing around before speaking to Han Li in a low voice.

"Sorry, Qiuhun was a bit sensitive on the way. I apologize on her behalf." Han Li cupped his hands.

"Hmph! What is this place?" Qu Ling snorted, looking around before asking.

"We're within the Nine Yuan Sect's territory. Please don't randomly extend your divine sense to explore, lest you be discovered." Han Li said calmly.

"Oh, if I recall correctly, Brother Han is currently being pursued by the Nine Yuan Sect, right? You're quite bold to come here." Qu Ling's expression changed, looking at Han Li deeply.

"Some matters require me to come here." Han Li smiled faintly, not revealing the Wheel of Reincarnation's plan to attack the Nine Yuan Sect.

"Brother Han, you've released me, so there must be a reason, right?" Qu Ling's eyes sparkled as he asked.

"Indeed, I have a task that requires your assistance. According to the information I've obtained, a Golden Devouring Beast might be hiding in the mountain valley ahead. However, the valley's restrictions are too heavy, and we can't sense the beast's presence. As you are of the same kind, I'd like to ask you to sense whether the Golden Devouring Beast is inside the valley." Han Li said, not mentioning the Golden Child.

"Could it be that there's a Golden Devouring Beast here? Brother Han, you're not planning to capture it, are you?" Qu Ling's eyes lit up, followed by a hint of suspicion.

"This Golden Devouring Beast has a connection to me. It stole something from me, and I need to retrieve it." Han Li chuckled.

"Ah, I see. Sensing the Golden Devouring Beast's presence is not difficult." Qu Ling looked at Han Li for a moment, then smiled and agreed.

He closed his eyes, and a golden light flashed around his body. After a moment, he opened his eyes, a hint of joy in his gaze.

"It's true; there is a Golden Devouring Beast in the mountain valley ahead. However, it's not on the surface but rather underground." Qu Ling said.
