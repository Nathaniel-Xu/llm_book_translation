Han Li, it would be better for you to join the True Speech Sect. Your "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique" is not bad, but it has many drawbacks. Right now, the five strands of time law within you are still weak, so you don't feel much. But when these time laws become stronger, various problems will arise, and you will be torn apart by the chaotic time laws, exploding and dying.

Miro Old Ancestor looked Han Li up and down, then spoke again in a calm tone.

Han Li's face changed several times, quickly becoming extremely serious.

Actually, after hearing Miro Old Ancestor's words, he had gained a deeper understanding of the "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique" and had already vaguely felt that the five strands of time law within him were not quite right.

Specifically, where was the problem, he still couldn't confirm, but Miro Old Ancestor's words were definitely true.

"Miro Senior's words are reasonable, so I will join the True Speech Sect." Han Li was silent for a moment, then raised his head and said, before preparing to give Miro Old Ancestor a bow.

"You and I are friends from different eras, so there's no need for these empty formalities." Miro Old Ancestor was overjoyed to see Han Li agree to join the True Speech Sect, and he reached out with a strand of invisible energy to hold Han Li's body, not allowing him to bow.

Han Li saw this scene and revealed a surprised expression.

"I may have taken you, Han Xiao You, as a disciple, but your abilities are not ordinary, and you will likely soon break through to the Great Luo Realm. You and I are nominally master and disciple, but we can treat each other as friends." Miro Old Ancestor smiled again.

Han Li heard these words and was truly surprised.

In the True Immortal Realm, the relationships between masters and disciples of various sects were all very strict, and the True Speech Sect was an ancient sect with strict rules and customs, especially emphasizing respect for one's elders. What did Miro Old Ancestor mean by this?

Although he couldn't understand, Miro Old Ancestor not allowing him to bow was exactly what he wanted.

Han Li had been used to traveling alone for many years, and if he had to kowtow to someone, even if it was his master, he would feel a bit awkward.

"I dare not, since I have taken you, Senior, as my master, I must naturally receive the master-disciple etiquette." He said respectfully.

Miro Old Ancestor also didn't insist on this matter, and instead pulled Han Li to sit down.

"Han Li, since you come from the future, what is the situation with the True Speech Sect in your time?" Miro Old Ancestor asked seriously.

"In my time, the True Speech Sect was long ago destroyed by the Heavenly Court. According to my investigations, it was the Heavenly Court's Time Ancestor who personally took action." Han Li hesitated for a moment, then said.

"Is that so..." Miro Old Ancestor heard these words, and his expression didn't change, as if he had already expected this.

"There's another matter, Master. Qi Mozi is not reliable, and he had already betrayed the sect and joined the Heavenly Court. And the destruction of the True Speech Sect is likely related to him, so please be cautious." Han Li hesitated again, then said.

"If it's heaven's will, there's no need to try to change it, or else who knows what will happen?" Miro Old Ancestor listened to these words, and his expression remained unchanged, before speaking calmly.

Han Li heard these words and was about to open his mouth to say something.

"Who can guarantee that stopping him will definitely prevent the destruction of the True Speech Sect, and that the situation will be better? Alright, don't worry about the True Speech Sect's affairs, you said you don't have much time to stay here, so quickly use the "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique" and let me take a look at the problems within." Miro Old Ancestor raised his hand to interrupt Han Li's words, then said.

Han Li didn't say anything else, and instead began to use the "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique".

The True Speech Treasure Wheel, the Time-Cutting Fire Torch, the Time-Purifying Vase, the Phantom Hourglass, and the East Yi Divine Tree all appeared, surrounding his body and slowly rotating.

This time, he was seeking Miro Old Ancestor's guidance, so he used the "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique" with all his might. The True Speech Treasure Wheel and the other objects not only had the time law lines shining brightly, but also had time law crystals appearing.

The fifty time law crystals that had been consumed by his previous time-traveling were mostly from the Time-Cutting Fire Torch, and now there were only over a hundred time law crystals left on the Time-Cutting Fire Torch.

The True Speech Treasure Wheel had thirty or so time law crystals wrapped around it, and the Phantom Hourglass, the Time-Purifying Vase, and the East Yi Divine Tree all had very few time law crystals, only a few roots.

Miro Old Ancestor looked at the True Speech Treasure Wheel and the other objects, nodded, and then shook his head.

Han Li saw Miro Old Ancestor's expression change, and he told him about the problems he had encountered during his usual cultivation, as well as his previous failure to break through to the Great Luo Realm. Then he cupped his hands and said, "Please, Master, point out the way."

"Time laws are one of the three supreme laws, surpassing the other three thousand great paths, and everything in the world cannot exist independently of them. The Five Elements are the foundation of all things in the world, and the "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique" is actually using the most ordinary Five Elements principles to explain the supreme time laws, which is the simplest and most fundamental principle." Miro Old Ancestor fell silent for a moment, then spoke slowly.
Han Li listened attentively, his eyes fixed on the old man.

"Water nourishes from below, fire blazes from above, metal is sharp, wood transforms, earth is thick, these five elements are not limited to the five elements law, they are also reflected in other laws, including the time law. The five elements cycle, generating and restraining each other, repeating endlessly, yet never dying. The 'Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique' is precisely the pursuit of this great principle, regardless of the passage of time, I will continue to cycle and repeat, standing firm in the river of time, forever unchanging." Mi Luo Old Ancestor continued.

Han Li's heart felt as if a lamp had been lit, and he felt a sense of awakening from a dream.

He had always been puzzled by the 'Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique', which was clearly a time cultivation technique, yet it produced five divine abilities with obvious five elements characteristics, namely the True Word Treasure Wheel, the Time Purification Bottle, the Illusion Hourglass, the Dong Yi Divine Tree, and the Fire Age Sprout. It turned out that the technique was using the five elements principle to explain the time principle.

"Therefore, the most important thing in cultivating the 'Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique' is balance, the five elements generate and restrain each other, if you can't grasp the balance, you will be harmed instead. Your current cultivation is uneven, the time law crystal threads on the Fire Age Sprout are numerous, but the Time Purification Bottle, the Illusion Hourglass, and the Dong Yi Divine Tree have very few. With such an imbalance, how can you successfully break through to the Great Luo Realm?" Mi Luo Old Ancestor said.

"Ah, I see. However, it's not easy to increase the time law crystal threads on the Time Purification Bottle, the Illusion Hourglass, and the Dong Yi Divine Tree. Treasures that contain time law power are hard to find, and it's even harder to find ones that are similar to the Time Purification Bottle, the Illusion Hourglass, and the Dong Yi Divine Tree. May I ask, Master, do you know of any other ways to increase the time law crystal threads?" Han Li asked, his brow furrowed in concern.

"The 'Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique' can refine the time law power within external objects, condensing it into time law crystal threads, this is a remarkable divine ability. Other time cultivation techniques can only be slowly comprehended, and the time law crystal threads can only be increased by advancing one's cultivation realm. You have already surpassed others by a huge margin, yet you are still not satisfied." Mi Luo Old Ancestor glared at Han Li, scolding him.

"Yes, disciple understands. However, in my original time and space, the Heavenly Court is pursuing me relentlessly, and I need to rapidly increase my strength. The True Word Sect has a deep foundation, and even the Sumeru Golden Mountain is a treasure that can communicate with the heavens. Master, can you grant me a few treasures that contain time law power, so that I can refine them and increase my strength?" Han Li asked, smiling.

"You little scamp, you're actually thinking of taking advantage of me. I do have some materials, but there may be some restrictions on crossing through time and space, you may not be able to bring them back to your original time and space." Mi Luo Old Ancestor said slowly.

Han Li was taken aback, he hadn't thought of this problem.

"However, it's worth a try." Mi Luo Old Ancestor said, after a moment of contemplation, and then waved his hand.

Three objects appeared beside him, a piece of ancient wood with a pale blue color, a broken water-blue long spear, and a yellowish-brown circular stone.

All three objects emitted strong time law fluctuations, which were no weaker than the Fire Age Sprout's crystal threads.

"Thank you, Master, for granting me these treasures." Han Li's mind was still reeling from Mi Luo Old Ancestor's words, but he was still delighted to see the three treasures, and he quickly stored them away.

"The path of cultivation requires patience, you must proceed step by step, and not rush forward recklessly. Your body's time law power is very turbulent, this is precisely because you have been cultivating too quickly. In the future, you must spend more time in quiet contemplation, to make up for this deficiency." Mi Luo Old Ancestor said.

"Yes." Han Li replied solemnly.

"Disciple has another question, regarding the cultivation of the spiritual realm. I have already cultivated the spiritual realm for many years, but I am still at the initial level, and have not been able to enter the creation realm and the transformation realm. What is the reason for this?" He shook his head, and asked again.

"Time law is the supreme law, its power is overwhelming, crushing all other laws beneath it. However, the heavens are balanced, and advancing in the time law realm is more difficult than other laws. The spiritual realm cultivation is the same. This problem can only be solved by you yourself, you must continue to comprehend the time law, and I have no other methods to help you." Mi Luo Old Ancestor shook his head.

Han Li nodded slowly, and then continued to ask questions, some regarding the 'Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique', some regarding magical artifacts, and others regarding various aspects of cultivation.

Mi Luo Old Ancestor's cultivation was profound and unfathomable, his insights into the laws, divine abilities, magical artifacts, and other aspects were equally profound and unfathomable. No matter what questions Han Li had, Mi Luo Old Ancestor was able to provide answers, pointing out the key points of cultivation, and giving Han Li a sense of clarity.

Before long, the golden wheel's time law pattern had almost disappeared.

Although only a short period of time had passed, Han Li's understanding of the 'Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique', the time law, and the entire cultivation system had already surpassed his previous level.

Han Li and Mi Luo Old Ancestor were still seated in the grand hall, facing each other.

Han Li no longer asked any questions, and Mi Luo Old Ancestor also remained silent, as if he knew that Han Li was about to leave.

"Thank you, Master, for your patience and guidance, disciple has benefited greatly." Han Li bowed respectfully.

"You have become my disciple, so I naturally must guide you in your cultivation. Unfortunately, time is limited, and I am also regretful. However, since you have the ability to traverse time and space, you should have the opportunity to return in the future, and I still have many things to teach you about the 'Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique'." Mi Luo Old Ancestor sighed, and said.
