Han Li's feet had just stepped onto the square when his eyebrows furrowed, and his feet immediately felt a scorching heat, as if he was walking on hot coals. Although his boots blocked the heat, he still felt like he was walking on fire.

However, after taking a few steps, he found that there was nothing else unusual, and he quickly adapted.

The several hundred meters wide square quickly came to an end.

Han Li stepped onto the stone steps in front of the crimson palace, looked up, and saw that the high gate was adorned with a plaque that read "Huo Yuan Palace" in ancient seal script. Above the plaque hung a copper plate with a flame pattern, and in the center of the plate was a strange flame symbol.

Han Li's eyes widened as he looked at the symbol, and he quickly dodged to the side, trying to avoid something.

Suddenly, the flame symbol on the copper plate flashed brightly, and a thumb-thick red flame shot out from it, straight at Han Li's forehead.

Han Li had already sensed the danger, but he was still unable to avoid it completely, and the flame hit his forehead.

A searing pain shot through his forehead, and his skin was instantly charred, revealing white bone underneath.

Han Li felt like his forehead was burning, as if his skull was about to melt.

Just as he was about to be overwhelmed, a silver light burst forth from his forehead, and a silver flame appeared, colliding with the red flame.

The flame bird's appearance caused Han Li's pain to subside, and his skin began to heal quickly.

He looked up, and his eyes flashed with a fierce light. The flame bird let out a loud cry, and the silver flames erupted, enveloping the red flame and devouring it.

The copper plate was quickly melted by the silver flames, and the fire energy it contained was absorbed by the flame bird. The remaining material turned into a puddle of copper liquid, flowing down the plaque.

The flame bird then flew back to Han Li, as if seeking praise, and circled around him.

Han Li smiled and beckoned, and the flame bird returned to him.

He rubbed his forehead, and the skin was already healed, but there was still a thumb-sized crimson mark left behind.

He looked up at the palace door, pushed it open, and stepped inside.

The interior of the palace was simple, with wooden shelves along the walls, each one holding a lantern with a small flame inside. In the center of the room was a circular altar, similar to the one in the golden palace, but made of red crystal.

On the altar were two objects: a white sphere the size of a dragon's eye, surrounded by a transparent white flame, and a golden flame.

Han Li's eyes scanned the room, and he felt a surge of energy. He raised his hand, and the time domain enveloped the room.

The air was filled with the power of time, and Han Li's hand beckoned to the golden flame.

The flame seemed to sense the power of time, and it wavered slightly, but it did not move.

Han Li smiled wryly. "It seems that without breaking the altar's formation, nothing can be taken."

He dispelled the time domain and approached the altar, examining it carefully.

After a moment, he stopped, rubbed his chin, and fell into thought.

Suddenly, he seemed to have an idea, and he began to set up a formation around the altar using flags and plates.

Soon, an eight-sided formation appeared around the altar.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed as he examined the formation, and he began to activate it.

The flags and plates lit up, and a golden light enveloped the altar, forming a golden wall around it.
As the spell formation on this side began to rotate, the altar suddenly shook violently, and the white fireball suspended above it flashed brightly. The nearly transparent flames on its surface surged upwards, seeping out in threads and flowing into the altar below.

The altar's surface instantly lit up with countless flame symbols, and a loud whooshing sound erupted as a wave of crimson flames burst forth, rushing towards Han Li.

However, the flames were blocked by the golden "city walls" and could not break through, instead surging upwards in a frenzy, like a massive pillar of fire that pierced the roof of the grand hall. With a deafening "boom," the flames were blown open, revealing a massive opening above.

Han Li gazed up at the opening above, his eyes flashing with a hint of determination. As long as he could use the spell formation to block the altar's power and prevent it from spreading, he could wait for it to dissipate into the void, weakening its energy. Then, he could safely enter the formation and retrieve the treasure.

But just as he thought this, a sudden change occurred!

The walls of the grand hall on either side began to glow red, as if heated by the flames, and strange flame symbols appeared on their surfaces, emitting a strange, pulsating energy.

"Damn it, the restrictions aren't just on the altar..." Han Li's eyes widened in alarm as he exclaimed.

As soon as he spoke, the flame symbols flashed red, and a pair of grotesque, horned heads emerged from within, their faces resembling those of oxen, with long, serpent-like bodies trailing behind them.

The two creatures burst forth from the wooden racks, and the flames from the lanterns on the racks shot upwards, attaching themselves to the creatures' bodies.

With a deafening "boom," the two creatures' bodies erupted in a fierce blaze, as if they had transformed into two clawless, fire-breathing dragons. They charged towards Han Li, their mouths agape.

Han Li dodged to the side, narrowly avoiding the creatures as they passed by. The two fire serpents circled around, their bodies forming a circle as they trapped Han Li in the center.

Han Li let out a wry smile. He had just built a high wall around the altar, and now these two fire serpents were doing the same to him.

The two serpents raised their heads, their eyes fixed on Han Li, and a cold, icy glint appeared in their eyes.

A deafening roar erupted from the serpents' mouths, and a wave of flames shot out, engulfing Han Li.

But Han Li's body was instantly surrounded by a golden light screen, protecting him from the flames. The ground beneath him began to shudder and crack, as if it could not withstand the intense heat.

Suddenly, the ground gave way, and the rocks beneath Han Li's feet turned into a sea of molten lava. The flames surrounded him, and he felt like he was being refined in a furnace, struggling to breathe.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he focused his energy, using his Heavenly Prison technique to resist the flames. His hands transformed into fists, and he swung them in a flurry of punches, striking the flames around him.

As he moved, his body began to glow with a soft, golden light, and his fists left behind a trail of starlight. The flames around him began to recede, and a circular, vacuum-like wall formed around him.

Han Li's movements became faster and more frenzied, his fists striking the flames with increasing force. The vacuum wall around him grew stronger, and the flames were compressed into a smaller and smaller area.

Finally, the wall exploded in a deafening "boom," releasing a massive amount of energy. The flames around Han Li were blown back, and the two fire serpents were torn apart, their bodies disintegrating into a vortex of flames.

Han Li's figure emerged from the flames, his fists still glowing with energy. He struck out with a pair of swift punches, and the walls of the grand hall on either side were blown open, revealing massive holes. The flame symbols on the walls were destroyed, and the wooden racks were reduced to splintered fragments.

As Han Li regained his footing, he saw that the flames on the altar had weakened by nearly a third, a clear sign that his spell formation was working.
