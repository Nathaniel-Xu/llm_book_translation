Han Li saw the middle-aged man break the Evil-Suppressing Divine Thunder with ease, and his pupils constricted slightly.

But when his gaze fell on the man's face, his heart stirred slightly.

The middle-aged man's appearance was unfamiliar, and Han Li confirmed that he had never seen him before, but for some reason, the man gave him a sense of familiarity, as if he had seen him somewhere before.

Han Li didn't notice that, in the distance, the black-clothed youth who was fighting with Lei Yu and Wen Zhong was shaken when he saw the middle-aged man appear, and his eyes flashed with excitement.

"Tell me, how did you see through my true form?" the middle-aged man asked Han Li, his voice calm, but the laziness in his tone was gone.

"Who are you? Why did you set up a trap here and try to harm us?" Han Li didn't answer the man's question, but instead asked his own.

"It seems we don't want to answer each other's questions. How about this: you answer one of my questions, and I'll answer one of yours?" the middle-aged man said, his eyes narrowing.

Han Li's eyebrows rose, and he glanced at Lanyan and the others, who were still fighting. Seeing that they were unharmed, he nodded in agreement.

"Since it's my method, I'll ask first," the middle-aged man said magnanimously.

"Who are you?" Han Li asked after a moment's thought.

"I've been imprisoned for countless years, and my name is unknown to you. I'm just a prisoner trapped in this place," the middle-aged man said indifferently.

Han Li heard the vague answer and frowned, feeling unsatisfied.

However, the man's words revealed that he was a prisoner trapped in this layer, which did answer one of Han Li's questions.

"I've answered one of your questions. Now it's your turn to answer mine. What are you people, and how did you come here?" the middle-aged man asked, looking at Han Li.

"We're from the Golden Source Immortal Domain, and we stumbled upon the cave of the Tai Sui Immortal Lord. We came here to search for treasures," Han Li replied vaguely.

"Tai Sui's cave has appeared?" the middle-aged man asked, his body shaking with surprise, and his eyes flashing with excitement.

"Now it's my turn to ask a question, I suppose," Han Li said, seeing the man's reaction, and his mind racing.

"Go ahead," the middle-aged man said, his face flashing with anger, but then he seemed to remember something and suppressed his anger.

"How many prisoners are there in this layer, apart from you?" Han Li asked, his eyes flashing.

The middle-aged man heard the question and didn't respond for a moment. Then, he burst out laughing.

"What's so funny?" Han Li asked, his voice low.

"Do you think I'd answer that question?" the middle-aged man asked, his smile disappearing.

"Does that mean you won't continue our conversation?" Han Li asked, his eyes narrowing.

"I've wasted enough time. I won't waste any more words on you, boy. Come and die," the middle-aged man said, his face twisting into a cruel smile, and his eyes flashing with gray-white light.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat, and he quickly looked away, his body glowing with golden light.

But no matter what he did, it was futile. The surrounding scenery changed, and the space turned into a gray-white mist.

The palace, Lanyan, and the others disappeared, and the middle-aged man was nowhere to be seen.

"Is this an illusion?" Han Li muttered.

He quickly calmed down and grasped his fists. Golden lightning flashed on his body, and a thunderous sound erupted. A layer of golden light condensed into a suit of armor, which looked like the god of thunder had descended.

Han Li's sleeves fluttered, and the sound of thunder echoed again. Thirty-six golden flying swords appeared, and he grasped a hand seal. The swords glowed with golden lightning, and a dazzling electric arc flashed out, containing a powerful lightning law.

"Go!" Han Li shouted, his hands pressing down.

The thirty-six swords exploded out, turning into thirty-six blinding golden lights that streaked through the gray-white space.

The space was torn apart, leaving thirty-six scars. But the gray-white space flashed with light, and the scars disappeared.

Han Li's face fell, and he was about to do something else.

Just then, the entire gray-white space lit up, and a dazzling gray-white light shone on Han Li's eyes, making them hard to open. He closed them slightly.

However, his golden armor flashed with lightning, and the thirty-six swords flew back to him, swirling around him and emitting a fierce sword aura.

The light flashed, and when it disappeared, Han Li opened his eyes to find that his body was fixed to a copper pillar, his hands and feet bound by thick copper rings. He was unable to move.

His golden armor and the thirty-six swords had vanished.

"This...!" Han Li's heart skipped a beat, and he let out a low growl. Over nine hundred points of mysterious light appeared on his body, and he used all his strength to struggle.

But the copper rings and pillar didn't budge, still holding him firmly in place.
"This is impossible!" Han Li exclaimed.

With his current physical strength, even if the copper pillar was a powerful immortal artifact, it shouldn't be able to withstand his full force without any reaction.

A loud, muffled sound echoed, and a wave of intense heat suddenly appeared on the copper pillar, causing it to turn bright red.

Han Li's skin was instantly scorched, and his body was covered in a thick layer of black smoke. His physical defense, which was normally unbreakable, seemed to have vanished.

A deep, searing pain shot through his body, as if his soul was being burned by the flames. Even Han Li's strong willpower couldn't withstand it, and he let out a muffled groan.

Before he could even react to the pain, a flurry of gray-white blades appeared in front of him, stabbing down at him with a sharp, piercing sound.

Han Li's face changed, and his body glowed with a brilliant golden light. The True Word Treasure Wheel appeared behind him, emitting countless golden waves that enveloped the surrounding area.

However, the copper pillar and the gray-white blades were unaffected by the True Word Treasure Wheel.

The blades continued to fall, stabbing into Han Li's body without any delay. Han Li's endurance was finally broken, and he let out a pained cry.

He realized that he had been trapped in an enemy's illusion, a powerful one that had complete control over his senses and spiritual awareness.

This illusion was unlike anything he had ever seen before, and it seemed to be able to break through the boundaries of reality and illusion.

As the blades continued to fall, a strange, unpredictable force began to emanate from them, enveloping Han Li's body.

But just as this force was about to overwhelm him, a burst of temporal energy emerged from Han Li's body, as if it had sensed an external force invading his space.

This energy resisted the unpredictable force, and for a moment, it seemed to be at a stalemate.

However, the blades continued to fall, piercing Han Li's body and causing him immense pain.

A wave of unpredictable energy accompanied the pain, invading Han Li's mind and causing his consciousness to become hazy.

Han Li's eyes began to glaze over, and his mind became cloudy.

A series of attacks came at him like a tidal wave, each one faster and more intense than the last. Han Li's willpower was strong, but even he was starting to feel overwhelmed.

Just as he was about to give up, a powerful spiritual energy surged up from within him, and his cultivation technique began to rotate automatically.

A crystal-clear sword shadow appeared in his mind, radiating a fierce and powerful energy.

Han Li's feelings of despair were instantly dispelled, and he regained his clarity.

He opened his eyes, and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead.

Han Li endured the intense pain, his eyes narrowing as he gazed at the gray-white space. A resolute look appeared on his face, and his body began to glow with an intense golden light.

He was about to activate the Great Five Elements Fantasy Technique, to completely destroy the gray-white space.

But just as he was about to do so, the gray-white space suddenly began to tremble, and a low, humming sound filled the air.

A massive, blood-red sword shadow appeared, piercing through the gray-white space and radiating a terrifying, destructive energy.

Han Li felt a chill run down his spine, and his spiritual energy seemed to be drawn towards the sword shadow.

"This sword shadow is...!" Han Li's cultivation technique rotated, and he immediately recognized the sword shadow.

If he wasn't mistaken, this was the Heavenly Fox Blood Knife!

The massive sword shadow slashed through the gray-white space, causing it to tear apart and disintegrate into countless gray-white light particles.

Han Li's vision blurred, and he found himself back in the collapsing palace. The green bamboo sword was still by his side, and the golden lightning armor was still on his body.

In the distance, the middle-aged man in blue robes stood with a shocked expression, looking at the black-clad youth who was holding the blood-red long knife.

The black-clad youth was standing not far away, and the Heavenly Fox Blood Knife was still radiating a powerful, destructive energy.

At the same time, the Li Qi beast appeared on the battlefield, fighting against the black-clad woman.

The Li Qi beast was surrounded by four or five hundred-foot-long white wind serpents, which were coiled around its body. The beast's mouth was open, and it was spitting out waves of white wind blades that were piercing through the air.

These wind blades seemed ordinary, but they were incredibly powerful, and they could easily tear through the air and create fissures.

The black-clad woman had a dark red circular shadow behind her, which had six black holes arranged in a hexagonal pattern. The circular shadow was rotating, and a powerful, unpredictable energy was emanating from the six holes.

This energy was able to easily deflect the wind blades, and then it crushed them with a single blow, making it impossible for the Li Qi beast to get any closer.

The others, including Lan Yu, were standing on the sidelines, their eyes gray and white, as if they had been controlled. However, they didn't move, and they seemed to be waiting for something.

Han Li looked at the black-clad youth and the woman, and his eyes narrowed. He immediately guessed what had happened.
