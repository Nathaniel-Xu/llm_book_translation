"If we're late, things will change, and we won't know what will happen, so it's better to take a risk and try...”

Han Li hesitated for a moment, then decided not to wait any longer and immediately took the white fire bead.

He raised his hand, and a small silver flame person appeared in the palm of his hand, which was the Jingyan Firebird.

This small thing was connected to Han Li's mind, and without needing to speak, it understood Han Li's plan. With a flash of silver light, it transformed into a silver flame that enveloped Han Li's entire body.

Han Li felt the layer of flame on his body and then raised his right arm to look at it.

At this moment, his right arm was also surrounded by a layer of flame, but unlike the other places, it was a seven-colored flame, which was the concentrated power of the seven-colored fire dan sand.

Han Li was ready, and with a slight movement, he charged into the altar with the silver flames swirling around him.

As soon as he entered the altar, the red flames that had seemed to weaken by three points suddenly surged up, becoming even stronger than before.

Han Li felt an unbearable burning sensation spreading from his body, and even his bones and meridians seemed to be being roasted over an open flame.

At the same time, his spiritual sea seemed to be filled with flames, causing his soul to be tormented. For a moment, Han Li felt like he could smell the scent of burning flesh in his nostrils.

He quickly gathered his thoughts and used his Lianhua technique and Tianxia Town Prison to raise his spiritual and physical state to their best condition, and only then did he feel the unbearable sensation subside.

At this time, the Jingyan Firebird on his body began to fully utilize its powers, suppressing its instinct to devour the flames and instead using its own flame power to push back the flames that were deadly to Han Li.

Despite this, Han Li's situation was still not easy.

The white fire bead and the golden flames were at the center of the altar, which was the hottest place. Han Li was already being burned by the flames at the edge, and it was even harder for him to penetrate deeper.

He furrowed his brow, gritted his teeth, and his face was filled with pain. His body was constantly sweating, and the water vapor rose up, making a hissing sound.

He took a step forward, his arm stretched out, and his fingers formed a claw as he reached for the white fire bead.

Just then, the palace door suddenly opened, and a figure flashed in.

Han Li divided his attention to investigate, and his brow furrowed. The person was none other than Xiongshan.

"Xiongshan..." Han Li couldn't speak, so he used his voice to shout.

"I'm just here to watch the fun, I won't do anything stupid," Xiongshan said, waving his hand to explain.

"Just watch, don't do anything unnecessary," Han Li warned, not having time to spare.

If Xiongshan dared to make any abnormal movements, he was confident that he could kill him within two to three breaths.

Xiongshan didn't speak, but stood obediently at the door, not taking another step forward.

The temperature of the altar was extremely high, and Han Li's right arm was still surrounded by the seven-colored flames, but the burning power was still making his brow furrow.

When his palm approached the white fire bead, a white shadow suddenly flashed across the center of the bead, looking like a symbol or a wisp of flame.

After it flashed, the white fire bead suddenly erupted with white flames, forming a layer of white light around it that blocked Han Li's hand.

Han Li's palm pressed against the light screen, and he was immediately enveloped by a strange power. The two flames seemed to be intertwined and resisted each other, unable to advance or retreat.

Just as he was about to use his true spiritual bloodline to forcefully break through the white flame screen, a sudden change occurred.

Xiongshan, who was standing at the door, suddenly changed his expression, raised his hand, and swung it forward.

A silver token shot out from his hand, flying towards the altar and bursting with silver light. The surface of the token was engraved with symbols, and numerous silver threads erupted from it, emitting a powerful spatial fluctuation.

Han Li sensed the change behind him, but it was difficult for him to withdraw at this moment. He could only force the Jingyan Firebird to separate from his body, using his physical body to resist the altar flames, and break through the white light screen.

The surrounding flames surged towards him, and Han Li felt like his internal organs were being burned. He could only rely on his powerful physique to endure the pain, turned around, and flew towards the outside of the altar.

However, as soon as he turned around, he saw a figure emerging from the silver light, which seemed to have torn through the void. It was a fire-red figure, and it raised its hand, pointing at Han Li's heart like a knife.

The person's face was twisted in a cruel smile, and it was none other than Qimozi.

Han Li's expression changed, and he quickly reversed his internal wheel, trying to move away from the spot. However, a flame-wreathed torch suddenly appeared in front of him, freezing him in place.

Qimozi didn't hesitate, and with a swift movement, he stabbed his palm into Han Li's heart.
As he watched, Qí Mó didn't relent, fiercely twisting his arm to shatter Han Li's entire chest, only withdrawing his hand to grab Han Li's neck.

"You little scoundrel, you can't escape this time, can you?" Qí Mó sneered, shouting loudly.

Having failed to gain the upper hand in their previous exchanges, Qí Mó's hatred for Han Li had grown extremely intense. Now that he had Han Li in his grasp, he felt an overwhelming sense of delight.

Han Li's chest was torn open, his entire body seemingly drained of its vitality, his limbs limp and lifeless as he was held in Qí Mó's hand. The light in his eyes quickly faded.

Qí Mó saw this and a hint of puzzlement flashed across his face. Just as he was about to deliver a fatal blow to Han Li's skull, his expression suddenly changed.

He saw that Han Li's body was suddenly enveloped in a layer of white light, his clothes instantly decaying into dust, his body transforming into a white puppet.

The puppet was made entirely of white beast bones, with various mysterious symbols attached to its body. It was the same substitute puppet that Han Li had obtained from Dōng Fāng Bái.

"A substitute puppet..." Qí Mó immediately recognized the object.

As soon as he spoke, Han Li's figure suddenly appeared behind him, surrounded by the five temporal law artifacts, including the True Speech Treasure Wheel, which countered Qí Mó's golden flame.

Han Li's brow flashed with light, and a small crystal sword shot out, disappearing in an instant.

Before Qí Mó could react, the sword had already pierced his brow, entering his mind and causing chaos.

Qí Mó's divine sense was disrupted, and he was thrown into a state of panic.

Han Li took a step forward, his Heavenly Prison Sect's cultivation surging, and punched Qí Mó's chest with incredible force, sending him flying into the altar, where he was engulfed by the flames.

All of this happened in the blink of an eye.

When Xióng Shān wanted to intervene, Qí Mó had already fallen into the altar, surrounded by the flames, and was propelled into the air.

Han Li didn't pursue him, instead re-entering the altar as the flames were disrupted by Qí Mó's presence.

The Jing Huǒ Niǎo, which was already struggling against the altar's flames, immediately pounced on Han Li, re-encasing him in a layer of flames.

Han Li's Heavenly Prison Sect's cultivation surged, and his True Spirit Bloodline was activated, causing his body to rapidly expand and transform into a three-headed, six-armed demonic form.

His right claw, which was enveloped in a layer of seven-colored flames, swiped at the air, piercing the light screen surrounding the white flame pearl and grasping it.

A loud explosion shook the air!

As the white flame pearl was pulled away from the altar, the entire formation began to collapse, and the flames spewing out of the altar rapidly dwindled.

A furious roar echoed from above, and Qí Mó descended, his face twisted in anger, as he charged towards Han Li.

However, Han Li had already retreated from the altar, surrounded by a ring of silver lightning that condensed into a silver lightning array, which vanished in an instant.

Qí Mó's body crashed into the ground, causing the altar to shudder violently, and a network of terrifying cracks appeared on its surface.

He slowly stood up, his massive hand clenched into a fist, which creaked with tension.

Xióng Shān hesitated for a moment before approaching Qí Mó, bowing and saying, "I'm sorry, sir. I failed to distinguish between the real and fake Han Li. Please punish me."

Qí Mó's expression changed, and he fell silent for a moment before sighing.

"It's not your fault. This substitute puppet is a product of the inner sect of Bǎi Zào Shān, and its intricacies are too complex for even me to discern. It's just that Han Li is too cunning, and he must have been prepared for this possibility from the moment you started following him."

Qí Mó's eyes seemed to drift off, and he continued, "I was too careless. I've already died at his hands once, and yet I still didn't learn my lesson."

Xióng Shān sighed, "I don't know if it's just my imagination, but compared to our previous encounter, Han Li seems to have grown even stronger. An opponent like him is truly frightening..."

Qí Mó's gaze wavered, and his voice trailed off, unsure if he was speaking to Xióng Shān or himself.

After a moment, his expression hardened, and he rubbed his still-aching brow, feeling a hint of fatigue.

His gaze then shifted to the remaining golden flames on the altar, and his face relaxed slightly as he said, "Never mind, time is pressing. Let's release those things first..."
