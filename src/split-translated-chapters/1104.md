Han Li let out a sigh of relief as he put away the True Speech Treasure Wheel, and with a flash of light, he flew towards the palace in front of him. He quickly arrived at the Golden Hall.

Above the hall, a giant plaque hung with the three large characters "Sui Yue Hall".

The doors of the hall were half-open, and from the gap, a dazzling golden light spilled out, accompanied by a massive time law fluctuation. Other strong auras, seemingly from treasure artifacts, also emanated from within.

However, the gap was too small to see inside, and Han Li's divine sense was severely hindered, unable to probe the interior.

Han Li stood before the hall, his eyes flickering slightly.

He didn't directly push open the door because in front of the main entrance of the Sui Yue Hall, a large square stretched out, with dozens of yellowish-brown stone swords standing upright. Each sword was as large as a small mountain, emitting a thick earth attribute law fluctuation.

There were thirty-six swords in total, arranged in a sword array that blocked the entrance to the hall. To enter, one had to pass through this array.

As Han Li's shoulder-mantled Phoenix Bird let out a chirp, it spread its wings, ready to fly towards the Sui Yue Hall.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he waved his hand, sending a golden light to wrap around the Phoenix Bird. Despite its protests, he forcibly pulled it into the Blossom Space.

The Phoenix Bird's power had grown significantly since it acquired the law of time, but its temperament had also become more unruly and difficult to control.

Han Li shook his head, continuing to examine the stone sword array before him. His brow furrowed, and his eyes flashed with a hint of anxiety.

This array, formed by the thirty-six stone swords, seemed simple, but the more Han Li looked at it, the more he felt that it contained hidden mysteries, making it impossible to discern.

If it were any other time, he could take his time to study and comprehend it, which would even benefit his own array formation arts. However, time was of the essence, and if he delayed any further, others might arrive, making it difficult for him to gain an advantage.

Han Li pondered for a moment before snapping his fingers.

A golden sword energy, ten zhang long and three zhang wide, shot out, striking one of the yellow stone swords.

The next moment, the stone sword emitted a low hum, and a thick yellow aura appeared, engulfing the golden sword energy. The energy was absorbed, leaving no sound or trace.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, realizing that relying on small tricks wouldn't be enough to break through this array. With a resolute heart, he formed a hand seal.

His body flashed with golden light as the True Speech Treasure Wheel appeared behind him, releasing countless golden ripples that enveloped the surrounding area.

Han Li, with the True Speech Treasure Wheel, stepped into the stone sword array.

As he entered, the scene before him changed, and he found himself in a desolate, yellow desert. The air was filled with a thick, yellow mist, and a massive pressure emanated from above.

"This is..." Han Li's expression changed as he took in his surroundings.

The yellow desert space was unlike ordinary illusionary spaces, being incredibly stable, with no visible flaws. Moreover, the only attribute present was earth, with no other attributes of heaven and earth, which weakened the effect of other laws by eight-tenths.

His heart tightened, and he activated the Nine Underworld Devil Eyes, his pupils flashing with a purple light as he gazed around.

At that moment, the surrounding yellow mist flashed, and the thirty-six giant yellow stone swords appeared, encircling him.

Each sword emitted a dazzling yellow aura, transforming into a thick, yellow light column that shot towards the sky.

Simultaneously, yellow sword energies emerged from the stone swords, like thirty-six blooming flowers.

In an instant, the sound of sword energies filled the air, and the yellow sword energies exploded, only to dissipate and disappear.

The next moment, the area around Han Li began to fluctuate wildly, as the yellow sword energies surged forth, layer upon layer, slashing towards him.

Han Li's heart sank, but he didn't panic. His hands moved swiftly, forming a wheel-like seal, and the True Speech Treasure Wheel behind him flashed, rapidly rotating. The golden ripples surrounding him condensed, forming a dense, golden barrier.

The sword energies struck, but upon entering the golden barrier, they were instantly frozen in place.

A ring-shaped, yellow sword wall formed around the golden barrier, motionless.

The subsequent sword energies continued to strike, but they too were trapped within the golden barrier, unable to move.

However, the yellow sword energies were incredibly powerful, and with thirty-six stone swords simultaneously unleashing their might, the sheer number of attacks was staggering.

In just a few breaths, the yellow sword wall surrounding the golden barrier grew to an alarming degree, condensing into a solid, yellow mass that engulfed the golden barrier and Han Li.
The sword energy continued to fly towards the solidified sword wall, striking it with a loud crash. The earthy yellow light burst forth, forming a series of earthy yellow suns that rapidly expanded and contracted, pressing inward.

A terrifying spiritual pressure emanated from the surrounding sword wall, pressing down on the interior. The golden ripple region began to vibrate violently, emitting a cracking sound.

Han Li's face changed, and he glanced at the surrounding earthy yellow giant swords. Thirty-six earthy yellow light columns shot up into the sky, converging into a single earthy yellow cloud.

Innumerable earthy yellow talismans flashed within the cloud, emitting a mysterious aura that grew stronger by the second.

Han Li's eyes twitched, and he let out a low shout. His hands changed into a different hand seal, and his body began to glow with a dense black light. His body suddenly expanded, transforming into a hundred-zhang-tall, three-headed, six-armed giant demon.

Over nine hundred of his acupoints burst forth with starlight, and a series of silver lines erupted from his acupoints, covering his entire body. A layer of starlight enveloped his giant demon body.

The giant demon let out a low roar, and its six fists struck the surrounding sword wall in unison. A massive black sun exploded, shattering the sword wall and creating an opening.

The giant demon withdrew its true words, and its body transformed into a black shadow that shot out of the opening, charging towards the nearest stone sword.

Innumerable yellow sword energies sensed the giant demon's intentions and shot towards it from all directions, blocking its path and striking its body with a series of deafening crashes.

However, the giant demon's starlight barrier was impenetrable, and it easily deflected the sword energies. The black shadow flashed, and the giant demon struck the stone sword with a single fist, its speed akin to lightning.

A massive explosion rocked the air, and the giant stone sword burst forth with earthy yellow light before shattering into countless yellow spirit lights.

The giant demon's other five fists simultaneously struck the air, creating five tangible fist silhouettes that shot out like meteors, destroying the surrounding sword energies and striking the other five stone swords.

Three consecutive massive explosions rocked the air, and three stone swords shattered. The two stone swords that were farthest away were only struck by the weakened fist silhouettes, but they were unable to shatter.

Han Li's lips curled into a faint smile, but it immediately disappeared.

The four stone swords that had shattered still had their earthy yellow light columns, which continued to soar into the sky, albeit slightly dimmer. The earthy yellow light columns began to converge, forming four earthy yellow sword silhouettes.

As the earthy yellow light columns converged, the four sword silhouettes rapidly solidified, and it seemed that they would soon re-condense into four stone swords. The surrounding earthy yellow light columns also began to brighten, returning to their original state.

Han Li stared at the scene in shock, and then he let out a furious roar. His body burst forth with golden light as he activated the Time Domain, and his six arms simultaneously formed a hand seal.

Over two hundred strands of law crystals shot out, splitting into two and fusing with the Time Domain's golden light. They transformed into two massive golden blades, each over a dozen li long, which slashed towards the left and right.

The area they traversed was filled with the Time Domain's law, which churned and boiled like a raging tide, striking fear into the hearts of all who witnessed it.

At the same time, thirty-six green bamboo flying swords shot out from Han Li's body, merging into a single, several-thousand-zhang-tall golden giant sword. The sword was surrounded by golden lightning, and its lightning laws burst forth as it slashed towards the earthy yellow cloud in the sky.

A series of massive explosions rocked the air as the two golden blades swept across the area, shattering over half of the stone swords. However, the earthy yellow light columns remained, and the Time Domain's laws seemed unable to harm them.

The earthy yellow light columns continued to converge, and the time within them rapidly reappeared, as if they would never be destroyed.

Another massive explosion rocked the air, and the lightning giant sword struck the earthy yellow cloud. The cloud seemed insubstantial, but it was incredibly resilient, only trembling slightly before returning to its original state and blocking the lightning giant sword's attack.

Han Li's face finally fell.

The earthy yellow cloud in the sky suddenly began to churn violently, and the surrounding earthy yellow energy surged forth like a burst dam, converging towards the cloud.

The earthy yellow light on the thirty-six stone swords below was sucked away, and the swords no longer emitted sword energies. All the light was absorbed by the earthy yellow cloud.

The cloud rapidly expanded, and the waves within it surged forth, revealing a massive, circular yet square, earthy yellow gate. The gate was adorned with sword-shaped patterns, emitting a sharp, piercing sword energy and an immense earthy law aura.

This earthy law aura was unlike any ordinary earthy law aura, giving off a sense of the vastness of the heavens and the earth. It seemed that this gate connected the heavens and the earth.

A massive explosion rocked the air, and the entire space became a hundred times heavier. Han Li's giant demon body sank, and his movements became extremely difficult.
