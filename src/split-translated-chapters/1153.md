Han Li heard this and couldn't help but smile wryly. "Is that so?" Mi Luo Old Ancestor's eyebrows moved slightly as he flipped his hand and took out a golden jade book, handing it to Han Li. "This is my experience and understanding of the Time Law, take it with you."

Han Li's heart was filled with joy as he accepted the jade book and put it away. "Thank you, Master."

Mi Luo Old Ancestor's expression turned solemn as he said, "As for the things you saw earlier, if you can bring them back, that's good, but if you can't, remember to go to a place called Yan Luo's Manor after you return to your own time."

Han Li was taken aback, "Yan Luo's Manor? What is that place? What do I do there?"

Mi Luo Old Ancestor smiled slightly and didn't explain. Han Li's brow furrowed, his master's words and actions were always mysterious and hard to understand.

Han Li didn't think too much about it and asked again, "Master, I have one more thing to ask, can you give me a copy of the 'Light and Shadow Heaven's Array' chart?"

Mi Luo Old Ancestor nodded and handed Han Li a jade slip. Han Li's eyes flashed as he took the slip and his divine sense entered it, quickly memorizing the contents.

As Mi Luo Old Ancestor said, the array chart wasn't complicated, and Han Li soon memorized it.

Just as Han Li finished memorizing the array chart, the last thread of time law on the golden ring above his head flashed and disappeared.

The golden ring suddenly expanded several times, and a dark, swirling vortex appeared above Han Li's head.

A massive force burst out from the vortex, enveloping Han Li's body and pulling him in.

"Han Li, the 'Great Five Elements Fantasy Technique' is a heaven-shaking and earth-shaking technique, after cultivating it, you can change the heavens and the earth, the Time Law Ancestor has always tried to get his hands on it, and other law ancestors also covet it, you must be careful..." Mi Luo Old Ancestor stood up and said.

Han Li's body was enveloped by the dark vortex, and he couldn't move or hear Mi Luo Old Ancestor's words. His consciousness faded to black.

...

After a dizzying spin, Han Li's vision cleared, and he saw a bright white light. His body, which had felt weightless, regained control, and his feet touched the ground.

The Palm Heaven Bottle also appeared and floated into his arms.

After standing still for a moment, Han Li looked around and saw that his vision was still a bit blurry. He sat down, closed his eyes, and took a few deep breaths before opening them again.

This time, Han Li's divine sense stabilized, and he saw his surroundings clearly.

Han Li found himself sitting on a cliff overlooking a vast expanse of blue sky and white clouds.

At this moment, he looked at his right hand and saw that he was still holding the jade slip that Mi Luo Old Ancestor had given him. However, the slip was being enveloped by a strange power and was rapidly fading away.

Han Li's face changed, and he seemed to remember something. He quickly took out the three materials that Mi Luo Old Ancestor had given him, the golden jade book, and the golden box he had taken from the Cang Gong Pavilion.

These items were also fading away, and after a few breaths, they disappeared without leaving any trace.

Han Li saw this and didn't seem surprised. "It seems Master was right, these things can't be brought back."

He thought that his gains from this trip were already enough, and the disappearance of these items didn't matter.

However, Mi Luo Old Ancestor had told him to go to Yan Luo's Manor, a place he had never heard of. He could only investigate later and see what Mi Luo Old Ancestor was up to.

Han Li didn't think about it anymore and continued to look around.

"Good kid, after such a long time of physical time-travel, you're the first to return without the Palm Heaven Bottle as a coordinate, and you only had a brief moment of instability before recovering," the bottle spirit's voice suddenly said.

"Bottle spirit, thank you for your help this time," Han Li said, taking out the Palm Heaven Bottle and responding.

"Enough with the formalities, I'm going to rest for a while and recover. You kid, take care of yourself and don't die," the bottle spirit said, blinking its eyes impatiently.

"Do you know where we are now?" Han Li asked.

"I don't know, but it's not the mortal world," the bottle spirit replied.
The atmosphere around you should have already been explored, the heavenly and earthly spiritual energy and the Immortal Realm are quite different, I suppose it's likely to be in the Barbaric Realm, specifically where... this ghost knows. The Barbaric Realm is vast, even the known Three Thousand Immortal Realms may not be comparable, and the number of True Spirits and Demonic Beasts living there is countless, so I remind you to be careful..."

The voice of the bottle spirit grew fainter and fainter until it completely disappeared.

As its voice faded away, the two bean-sized eyes on the bottle also disappeared.

Han Li sighed helplessly, and put the bottle back into his chest. He stood up and walked to the edge of the cliff, gazing out at the vast expanse below. As far as the eye could see, there was only endless yellow sand, with occasional mountain ranges rising and falling, and patches of red-brown gobi desert visible, but very little green vegetation.

"Never mind, let's find a safe place to settle down and cultivate for a while," Han Li thought to himself.

He flew off into the distance, his body transformed into a streak of blue light as he sped towards the heart of the desert.

...

After flying for over a month, the endless sand finally gave way to a lush green oasis.

Han Li had encountered many sand beasts along the way, but hadn't stopped to rest until he reached the edge of the oasis, where he planned to take a short break before continuing on his journey.

However, just as he was about to sit down and meditate, he suddenly furrowed his brow and gazed out at the other side of the mountain, where a fierce battle was unfolding.

Han Li hesitated for a moment before suppressing his own spiritual energy and hiding his presence, then flew off towards the battle.

As he drew closer, he heard the sound of wild beasts roaring and the clash of spiritual energy. When he crested a small hill, he saw a chaotic scene unfolding below.

Two tribes of barbarians were locked in fierce combat, their numbers in the tens of thousands.

One tribe was made up of people with human bodies and rhinoceros heads, their skin as black as ink, with silver horns on their noses and metallic sheens on their skin. They wielded massive stone axes and fought with a ferocity that seemed almost bestial.

The other tribe was smaller, but more agile, with tiger-like bodies and cloud-like markings on their skin. They had no weapons, but their claws were sharp and deadly.

The two tribes clashed in a frenzy of blood and steel, their battle raging across the plain.

Han Li watched from a distance, his eyes scanning the battlefield. In the center of the chaos, he saw a giant rhinoceros-like creature, over ten meters tall, locked in combat with a cloud-marked tiger.

The two creatures were clearly the leaders of their respective tribes, and their battle was a clash of spiritual energy and martial prowess.

Just as Han Li was observing the battle, the cloud-marked tiger suddenly sniffed the air, its eyes narrowing as it caught Han Li's scent.

The rhinoceros-like creature also stopped fighting, its eyes fixed on Han Li.

"It seems we have a human," the tiger growled, its voice low and menacing.

The rhinoceros-like creature also turned its attention to Han Li, its eyes flashing with anger.

"I'm just passing by," Han Li said, trying to defuse the situation.

But the two tribes didn't care. With a fierce cry, they charged towards Han Li, their warriors abandoning their battle to attack the lone human.

Han Li sighed, knowing he had stumbled into trouble. He flew up into the air, planning to leave, but then thought better of it. He decided to ask the tribes about their location, hoping to gain some information.

With a swift motion, Han Li flew down towards the two tribe leaders, his body glowing with spiritual energy.

The rhinoceros-like creature swung its massive axe, unleashing a wave of bloody energy that threatened to engulf Han Li. The cloud-marked tiger, meanwhile, unleashed a burst of speed, its paws barely touching the ground as it chased after Han Li.

The two creatures worked together seamlessly, their attack covering all angles. Han Li's eyes narrowed as he realized he was in a tight spot.

The rhinoceros-like creature's axe seemed to fill the entire sky, its energy waves crashing down on Han Li like a tidal wave. The cloud-marked tiger, meanwhile, was hot on his heels, its claws snapping wildly as it tried to catch up.

Han Li's pupils constricted as he realized he was in grave danger.
