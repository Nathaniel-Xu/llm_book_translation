Han Li looked in the direction of the sound, his brow furrowed.

He saw that the white jade cushion he had been sitting on had suddenly developed a crack, and then shattered with a loud "crack" sound.

However, what was strange was that the cushion did not break into pieces, but instead turned into a layer of white powder that scattered in all directions.

At the same time, the entire golden hall began to shake violently, and a strange vibration spread out from it.

Han Li felt a slight anomaly in his heart, and then thought of something and quickly retreated, flying out to the white stone square.

As a result, when he got outside, he found that the shaking outside was even more intense than inside.

"Master, what's happening..." Ti Hu cried out, flying over with the Jing Yan Firebird.

"I don't know, it seems I triggered some kind of mechanism in this immortal's secret realm, and this realm is about to undergo a change." Han Li said thoughtfully.

"Then we should leave quickly." Ti Hu said hastily.

"What a pity..." Han Li sighed.

There were obviously many secrets hidden in this immortal's secret realm, but they had no time to explore them now.

As they turned to leave, they suddenly stopped in their tracks.

The void crack that connected the inside and outside of the secret realm had disappeared!

"How is this possible? The crack was just there a moment ago, don't you believe me, ask Xiao Jing?" Ti Hu exclaimed.

The Silver Flame Child, who was still sitting on her shoulder, nodded vigorously, and the seven-colored flames on his head shook violently.

"I believe it, this secret realm's space must have undergone some kind of change." Han Li said.

He had noticed the changes in the Jing Yan Firebird's body earlier, but had no time to ask about it now.

"By the way, during Master's closed-door cultivation, this secret realm has experienced over ten shocks, the most intense one being when you broke through to the late stage of the Nascent Soul. And this month, including this time, there have been four shocks. Each time the shock occurs, the mist around the secret realm will retreat a bit, and some new regions will be revealed." Ti Hu said.

"Have you gone to investigate those places, and found anything unusual?" Han Li asked, his brow furrowed.

"I only went close to one of them, and didn't find anything unusual. But since the shocks have become more frequent, I didn't dare to leave, and have been waiting here." Ti Hu shook her head.

Han Li listened, his brow furrowed, and was thinking about what was going on when the great hall in front of him suddenly shook violently, and a hundred-zhang-thick golden light burst out from the hall, shooting straight into the nine heavens.

After that, the shaking of the great hall suddenly subsided.

Han Li saw this, and his heart was filled with doubt, and he flew forward to take a closer look, but was blocked by an invisible force, and couldn't get close to the hall door.

"Master, do you feel like the earth is slowly rising?" Ti Hu asked suddenly.

Han Li had been paying attention to the golden light earlier, and only now reacted to her words.

He flew up to take a look around, and saw that the gray mist at the edge of the secret realm was surging violently, and a new piece of land was slowly emerging from the mist.

...

Outside the immortal's secret realm, in the middle of the Jin Yuan Mountain Range, Qing Si Valley.

The ground was shaking violently, making a huge noise, like an earthquake.

"This is the earth dragon turning over!" The villagers of Yu Liang Village exclaimed, running out of their homes to the open area.

At this moment, a loud thunderous sound came from underground, and a huge golden light pillar suddenly shot up from the ground, piercing the sky, and entering the clouds.

The light pillar was enormous, and the nearby mountains seemed tiny in comparison.

With the golden light pillar as the center, the surrounding heaven and earth energy was violently fluctuating, and the golden clouds in the sky were rolling and tumbling, making a loud rumbling sound like a thousand horses galloping.

The villagers of Yu Liang Village stared at the scene in shock.

"This is a divine sign, a divine manifestation!" Someone shouted, and the villagers of Yu Liang Village knelt down to worship the golden light pillar.

Not to mention the ignorant villagers of Yu Liang Village, seven or eight streaks of light flew in from the east-southeast direction, and in an instant, they arrived at the nearby area, stopping in mid-air about ten li away from the mountain valley.

The light dissipated, revealing a group of cultivators.

The leader was an old woman with gray hair, who was at the Golden Immortal level, holding a yellow snake staff, and the others were young men and women who were only at the True Immortal level.

All of them wore the same earth-yellow feathered robes, and seemed to be from the same sect.
As they gazed at the extraordinary phenomenon before them, the young men and women all revealed excited expressions.

"Uncle Lin, this phenomenon seems to be a sign of a treasure emerging, a secret realm appearing in the mortal world! Let's hurry down and take a look, if we wait any longer, it will be troublesome," a young male disciple with a pale complexion exclaimed to the gray-haired old woman.

The others also nodded in agreement, eager to take action.

"Don't be rash, this phenomenon is indeed a sign of a treasure emerging, but it has not fully appeared yet. Going down now would be pointless. Moreover, this phenomenon is not trivial, it's not something we can control. Quickly send a message back to the sect and inform the Sect Master of the situation," the gray-haired old woman said, her expression also somewhat excited, but still calm.

The young men and women behind her immediately took action, taking out their transmission arrays to contact the sect.

At this moment, two more streaks of light flew in from the distance, arriving near the mountain valley, revealing two black-robed cultivators with sinister faces, both of whom were Golden Immortal cultivators.

"They're from the Black Fiend Sect," a young man behind the old woman whispered.

"Don't mind them, come over here," the gray-haired old woman glanced at the two black-robed cultivators and led the group to the top of a nearby mountain peak.

The two black-robed cultivators looked at the group, then turned away, flying to a nearby mountain peak and taking out their transmission devices to contact others.

In the central part of the Golden Source Mountain Range, the extraordinary phenomenon of a massive pillar of light shooting into the sky spread rapidly, and soon, the various factions within the Golden Source Mountain Range were aware of the situation. More and more people arrived at the scene.

In the blink of an eye, half a month passed, and the golden pillar of light not only didn't weaken, but instead showed a trend of growing stronger.

Inside the secret realm, Han Li stood within, his eyes shining brightly.

As the secret realm shook, the gray mist at the edge rapidly dissipated.

At this moment, the space within the secret realm had expanded several times, gradually revealing its true appearance.

On either side of the dense forest, two massive golden mountain peaks emerged, stretching into the sky, resembling two heavenly walls that sandwiched the forest, forming a massive canyon.

The golden mountain peaks on either side were shrouded in thick gray clouds from the middle up, making it impossible to see the true appearance of the mountains.

The most peculiar thing was that thick gray chains, each as thick as a water jug, hung down from the gray mist, all the way to the foot of the mountain, resembling a waterfall.

The chains flashed with gray lightning, crackling with energy, and looked quite intimidating.

Han Li flew down to the foot of a mountain peak, looking at the gray chains, hesitating for a moment before reaching out to touch one.

A gray lightning bolt shot out from the chain, striking him.

Han Li grunted, his body retreating a step, the area struck by the lightning bolt turning dark.

He circulated his spiritual energy, and his body quickly recovered, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes. The gray lightning bolt's power was enormous, and even with his robust physical body, he couldn't withstand it.

And this was just one lightning bolt; if more lightning bolts were to strike, he wouldn't be able to guarantee his safety.

Han Li withdrew his gaze from the mountain peak, the entrance to the space behind him a stable void. He looked towards the depths of the canyon formed by the two mountain peaks, where the gray mist was rapidly dissipating, revealing a path leading deeper into the secret realm.

He moved, flying towards the path.

...

Meanwhile, the area around the Qing Silk Valley was filled with cultivators, with tens of thousands of people gathering within a radius of a thousand miles.

The various factions began to divide the area into their own territories, with some solitary cultivators finding a place to stand. However, the larger factions needed more space. The area closest to the pillar of light was occupied by seven or eight factions.

The gray-haired old woman's group had been forced to retreat, and they were now accompanied by three more people: a middle-aged man with a yellow complexion, a seductive young woman, and a white-haired old man.

The three newcomers were all Golden Immortal cultivators, with the yellow-faced man having reached the late Golden Immortal stage. He stood at the front of the group, looking like the leader.

"The Ling Xiao Sect, the Wang You Pavilion, the Lie Guang City, the Mo Xiang Lou, the Qing Su Valley, the Ling Yue Guan, and the Bai Yun Mountain Villa! The top factions in the Golden Source Mountain Range have all arrived, and they've taken our territory!" the gray-haired old woman exclaimed, her eyes fixed on the Ling Yue Guan faction.

The territory they had previously occupied had been taken by the Ling Yue Guan faction.

"There's nothing we can do, we're not as powerful as they are. Those factions all have Taiyi Realm cultivators, our small Huang Feng Sect can't compete with them," the yellow-faced man sighed.

"According to our investigations, this phenomenon should be a secret realm or a heavenly palace emerging. When it comes to treasure hunting, it's not just about who has the strongest power, luck is also important," the middle-aged woman said with a snort.

The others nodded in agreement, although they knew that her words were mostly self-consoling.

"It's strange, the Tong Tian Sword Sect and the Tian Shui Sect aren't in the Golden Source Mountain Range, and they're too far away, so it's not surprising they haven't arrived yet. But why haven't we seen anyone from the Xian Gong?" the white-haired old man asked, frowning.
