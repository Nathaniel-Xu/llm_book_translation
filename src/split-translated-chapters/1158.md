Han Li's eyes gleamed with anticipation as he opened the golden silk thread, unfurling the scroll.

The cover of the scroll bore the title "Sui Yue Zhen Jing" in ancient, elegant script, with a subtle hint of weariness and a profound sense of timelessness.

Han Li's eyes widened as he read the title, and he quickly flipped through the pages, his brow furrowing in concentration.

As he had guessed, the scroll was a cultivation technique for mastering time, and it seemed to be incredibly refined, drawing inspiration from the concept of time as a burning flame that would reduce all things to nothingness.

Han Li spent half a day carefully reading through the scroll, a look of joy spreading across his face as he finished. He reached out and gently stroked the Sui Yue Shen Lamp, a hint of excitement in his eyes.

The cultivation technique described in the Sui Yue Zhen Jing was indeed exceptional, although it couldn't compare to the Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue. Still, it was one of the most advanced time-based techniques in the Zhen Yan Men.

However, Han Li's excitement wasn't solely due to the technique itself, but rather the fact that the Sui Yue Zhen Jing included the ritual for activating the Sui Yue Shen Lamp.

When the Sui Yue Tower had collapsed, the lamp's flame had been extinguished, rendering it useless. Han Li's expression had been calm, but he had seethed with frustration inside.

Now, with the ritual in hand, he finally saw a glimmer of hope.

Han Li set aside the Wu Lei Zheng Fa Zhen Jing and the Tong Tian Sword Array diagram, deciding to focus on the Sui Yue Shen Lamp's ritual.

Although he had initially planned to study the other two treasures in detail, he couldn't afford to waste any more time. The Tong Tian Sword Array and the Wu Lei Zheng Fa Zhen Jing would have to wait.

Han Li reopened the Sui Yue Zhen Jing, flipping to the section on the ritual. His expression turned pensive as he read through the instructions.

The ritual itself wasn't complicated, but it did require a certain level of proficiency in the Sui Yue Zhen Jing's time-based techniques. If he were to master the technique, he could use its power to nurture the lamp's flame.

However, Han Li had cultivated the Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue, which was far more advanced than the Sui Yue Zhen Jing. While he could attempt to activate the lamp, it wouldn't be easy, and he might need to start cultivating the Sui Yue Zhen Jing from scratch.

As a result of his studies under Mi Luo La Zu, Han Li had gained a deep understanding of the principles of time-based cultivation. He knew that time-based techniques were among the most difficult to master, and that the slightest distraction could lead to disaster.

Han Li's current cultivation was still incomplete, and he couldn't afford to divide his attention. He had to focus on the Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue, lest he risk losing his way and jeopardizing his future.

Mi Luo La Zu had only taught him the basics of time-based cultivation, and the various time-based techniques of the Zhen Yan Men. He hadn't transmitted any other techniques to Han Li, fearing that they might disrupt his focus.

Han Li wouldn't sacrifice his future for the sake of activating a single treasure. However, he didn't intend to give up on the Sui Yue Shen Lamp either.

With a resolute expression, Han Li raised his hands, and a golden flame erupted before him. It was the Sui Yue Zhen Jing's flame, which he had obtained from the Sui Yue Tower's altar.

Next, he summoned the Duan Shi Huo Ba, a flame that seemed to defy the flow of time. Han Li's hands moved swiftly, his fingers weaving intricate patterns as he channeled his spiritual energy.

The Duan Shi Huo Ba began to rotate, releasing bursts of time-based energy that merged with the Sui Yue Zhen Jing's flame. The resulting mixture was a swirling vortex of energy that seemed to defy the laws of time.

Han Li's expression turned grave as he focused his energy, using the Zhen Yan Men's secret technique, the "True Word Conversion Method," to simulate the Sui Yue Zhen Jing's time-based energy.

This technique allowed him to use his spiritual energy as a medium, mimicking the energy of the Sui Yue Zhen Jing. Mi Luo La Zu had taught him this method, which was originally intended to help him activate the various treasures he had acquired.

In the Zhen Yan Men, it was common for cultivators to acquire treasures that didn't resonate with their own energy. The True Word Conversion Method was a way to bridge this gap, allowing cultivators to unlock the full potential of their treasures.

Han Li's situation was far from unique. In the Zhen Yan Men, even the most powerful cultivators often struggled to activate their treasures, due to the differences in their energy signatures.

The True Word Conversion Method was a remarkable technique that allowed cultivators to simulate the energy of their treasures, even if it wasn't an exact match. However, it required a deep understanding of the underlying principles and a high degree of spiritual energy.

Han Li's current energy signature was different from the Sui Yue Zhen Jing's, but he was confident that he could use the True Word Conversion Method to simulate its energy. With a deep breath, he began to channel his energy, carefully manipulating the Duan Shi Huo Ba's time-based energy to resonate with the Sui Yue Zhen Jing's flame.
It was likely that Qimozi was able to control the Years God Lamp by using the True Words Transcending Spirit Technique.

Han Li activated the True Words Transcending Spirit Technique, continuously simulating the Years God Lamp's power with the Disrupting Time Laws. At first, he was a bit clumsy, and the Disrupting Time Laws and Years God Lamp's power clashed intensely.

However, as the secret technique became more familiar, the conflict between the two gradually subsided, and the True Words Transcending Spirit Technique became more and more smooth.

Han Li's eyes flashed with a hint of joy, and he became even more focused on operating the technique.

Time passed, and in the blink of an eye, five or six years had passed.

The caravan's journey was quite smooth, and they only encountered a few ordinary fierce beasts along the way, which were easily dealt with by Santu and Yunbao. They didn't encounter any major dangers.

However, Santu and Yunbao were extremely cautious and took turns patrolling the surroundings, preventing any potential dangers from arising.

At this moment, Santu and a Silver Horned Rhinoceros clansman were patrolling around the caravan.

"Tribe Leader, do you think this Stone Elder is genuinely helping us? I always feel that giving him the Pixiu cub wasn't a good idea," the Silver Horned Rhinoceros clansman whispered, glancing at Han Li's room.

"Don't speak nonsense! Stone Elder's power far surpasses ours, and your whispers might be overheard by him!" Santu's expression changed, and he scolded the clansman through transmission.

The Silver Horned Rhinoceros clansman was startled and immediately became more obedient.

The two of them kept an eye on Han Li's room, but after a long time, there was no unusual activity, and they secretly let out a sigh of relief.

"You think I don't know these things, but Stone Elder's power is too strong, and we don't have any room for negotiation. Moreover, the Pixiu cub is too precious, and even if we and the Cloud Patterned Tiger Tribe were to send it to the Eight Desolations Mountain, it would not be a blessing, but a disaster. So, regardless of Stone Elder's intentions, we can only rely on him for now. Don't speak such dissenting words again, and let the other tribespeople refrain from discussing this in private!" Santu transmitted, his voice even weaker.

"Tribe Leader, you have a broad vision, I understand," the Silver Horned Rhinoceros clansman replied, his face filled with admiration.

Santu nodded, about to say something else, when a muffled sound came from Han Li's room.

Santu and the Silver Horned Rhinoceros clansman were startled, thinking that Han Li had overheard their conversation. Their faces changed, and Santu quickly thought of an explanation.

However, after a long time, Han Li's room remained silent, and the two of them looked at each other in confusion.

At this moment, in the Flower Branch Space, Han Li was covered in dust and dirt, his hair and clothes partially burned, and his body was charred in several places. He looked extremely disheveled, and the Years God Lamp's flame had disappeared.

However, he didn't care about his injuries and instead had a joyful expression in his eyes.

After six years of effort, he had finally succeeded in simulating the Years God Lamp's power using the True Words Transcending Spirit Technique.

The moment he completed the simulation, he became overjoyed and forgot to control the technique's power, causing the Years God Lamp's flame to erupt and almost injuring himself.

Han Li took out a healing pill and swallowed it, and his injuries quickly recovered.

He sat down again, took out the Years God Lamp, and summoned the Disrupting Time Laws flame, which he then ignited with a finger technique.

A stream of Disrupting Time Laws shot out from the flame, quickly merging together and forming a golden flame that emitted a unique time law fluctuation, similar to the Years God Lamp's flame.

Han Li pushed his hand forward, and the fake Years God Lamp's flame flew out, enveloping the Years God Lamp. The golden flame danced and slowly merged into the Years God Lamp.

He saw this and smiled, quickly activating the Years God Lamp's refining technique.

The Years God Lamp's surface emitted a faint golden glow, which flashed weakly.

Han Li saw this and let out a sigh of relief, feeling that his efforts over the past few years had not been in vain.

He then held the Years God Lamp in his arms, refined three or four more fake Years God Lamp flames, and merged them into the lamp, continuing to refine it.

Solving the Years God Lamp's flame problem, the next steps became much simpler.

As Han Li continued to refine the Years God Lamp, the golden glow on its surface became brighter, and the time law fluctuations it emitted grew stronger.

Finally, after three months of continuous refining, the Years God Lamp's wick flashed with a golden light, and a golden flame emerged.

The moment the flame appeared, a powerful time law fluctuation burst out from the Years God Lamp, spreading outward like a tidal wave, causing the heaven and earth's energy in the Flower Branch Space to surge violently.

The powerful sacred artifact that had once dominated the Taisheng Xianfu reappeared!

Han Li looked at the fully revived Years God Lamp in his hand, a joyful expression on his face. He then made a finger technique, and the Years God Lamp's flame suddenly grew brighter.

A narrow, golden light shot out from the flame, transforming into a golden dragon.

The golden dragon let out a mighty roar, and its body began to take shape, filling the Flower Branch Space with an intense, golden light.
