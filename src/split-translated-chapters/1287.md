Han Li walked forward, parted the grass, and saw that the stone stele was covered in dark green moss, with the inscriptions almost buried beneath. Only the words "Zhī Fǔ" (Abode of the Underworld) could be vaguely made out.

The break on the stele was uneven, with a fist-sized hole in the middle.

"Uncle, look over there!" Jin Tong suddenly exclaimed.

Han Li followed the sound and soon found the other half of the broken stele in a nearby clump of grass. After sweeping away the dirt and debris, the words "Yán Lóu" (Gates of the Underworld) were revealed.

"It seems this is the location of the Yán Lóu Zhī Fǔ. Since there's no cave entrance, there must be a secret realm or a restrictive array present." Qiú Hún's gaze shifted from the stele to the surroundings, and he spoke up.

"Right here," Han Li nodded and said.

"Here?" Jin Tong was puzzled.

Han Li smiled, raised his hand, and a golden light burst forth from his palm, enveloping the broken stele. With a gentle motion, he lifted the stele and placed it on the ground, where it merged with the other half.

The two broken steles fit together perfectly, with the seams aligning seamlessly.

"But it's still missing a piece," Jin Tong exclaimed.

Indeed, the center of the merged stele still had a fist-sized hole.

"It seems we need a key," Guī Wū's voice came from Han Li's waist.

"Guī Wū, do you know what this key is?" Han Li asked.

"This Yán Lóu Zhī Fǔ has existed for a long time, and I don't even know who built it. How would I know what the key is? But you, Han Li, since you're searching for this place, shouldn't you know?" Guī Wū replied.

Han Li's expression turned awkward. When he met Mí Luó Lǎo Zǔ, the old man had told him to find the Yán Lóu Zhī Fǔ, but didn't mention the location or the restrictive key. How was he supposed to know?

He walked forward, squatted down, and examined the stele carefully. However, he couldn't detect any obvious signs of a restrictive array or spatial fluctuations.

Han Li pondered for a moment, then reached out to touch the hole. Suddenly, he felt a sense of familiarity with the shape and size of the hole. He inserted his finger into the hole and felt around, and his eyes lit up with a smile.

He withdrew his finger, wiped away the moss, and flipped his palm. A golden light flowed out, and a small, golden inkstone appeared, adorned with a carving of a sleeping yellow cow. The inkstone was the same one Wǔ Yáng had given him in Jiǔ Yuán City.

As soon as the inkstone appeared, a golden light burst forth, and the air was filled with the rich, earthy scent of the inkstone's restrictive array.

In response, the stele began to glow with a dense pattern of symbols, and the hole in the center shone with a golden light, emitting a gentle, attractive force.

Han Li extended his palm, and the inkstone flew out, landing in the hole with a perfect fit. The two merged, becoming one.

Instantly, the stele erupted in a brilliant display of light, and a golden vortex appeared.

"Whoa, it's open!" Jin Tong exclaimed.

Han Li's expression turned thoughtful. "Is this the result of fate, or was it arranged by Lǎo Zǔ?"

"What's wrong, Uncle? The door is open, but you're not going in?" Jin Tong asked, noticing Han Li's peculiar expression.

Han Li shook his head, setting aside his doubts for the moment. Just as he was about to enter, he remembered something and stopped. He turned to Jin Tong and Qiú Hún and instructed, "Now that the island's restrictive array is broken, external enemies may arrive at any moment. You two should stay here and guard the entrance."

"Don't worry, we'll take care of it," Qiú Hún replied, nodding.

Jin Tong was curious about what lay within the Yán Lóu Zhī Fǔ, but he reluctantly agreed to stay behind.

"Guī Wū will be in your care as well," Han Li said, handing Qiú Hún a small, black box.

"I'll take care of it," Qiú Hún replied, understanding Han Li's intentions.

The black box remained silent.

After making the necessary arrangements, Han Li turned to face the golden vortex and stepped forward.

As he did, a powerful, attractive force enveloped him, and he felt the world spinning around him. When he regained his balance, he found himself standing on a lush, green plain.

The plain stretched out before him, seemingly endless, with only the distant, hazy outlines of majestic mountains visible on the horizon.

A few hundred feet away, a solitary, ten-meter-tall jujube tree stood tall, its branches stretching towards the sky. Beneath the tree, a small, neatly constructed thatched hut stood, its roof carefully arranged with uniform layers of thatch.

Despite its modest size, the hut was well-built, with even the thatch on the roof carefully tied in place.
"Look what's taking you so long? I've been waiting for you for a while now." A familiar voice suddenly came from inside the thatched hut.

Immediately, a fat monk with a red robe and a rosary in hand squeezed out of the doorway.

His earlobes were extremely long, hanging down to his shoulders, and his face was filled with a warm smile. His two long, narrow eyes were narrowed into a slit, and his massive belly made him look like a lovable person.

"Master?" Han Li's eyebrows rose in surprise and delight.

However, he soon realized that the monk in front of him was just a residual soul of Mi Luo Old Ancestor.

"Looks like you're a bit disappointed, haha..." Mi Luo Old Ancestor chuckled.

"At first glance, I thought Master was still alive, and I couldn't help but feel a bit... regretful." Han Li's eyes dimmed, and he sighed.

"You're here, and that's all that matters to me. I've been waiting for a long time, and I won't have any regrets now." Mi Luo Old Ancestor smiled, saying.

"I'm just glad to have the opportunity to hear Master's teachings again. I won't have any regrets either." Han Li smiled and replied.

"This secret realm was built by my residual power, and it's been sealed for many years without any consumption. Now that the seal is broken, my power will soon dissipate. Let's not waste any more time, and let me see your cultivation results." Mi Luo Old Ancestor said.

Han Li nodded and immediately activated the "Great Five Elements Fantasy Realm" technique within his body.

He snapped his fingers, and the Time Domain opened up, enveloping the surrounding area within a radius of several dozen li.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed slightly, feeling a bit surprised.

"Don't be surprised, this space is only this big. The mountains and grasslands beyond are just illusions." Mi Luo Old Ancestor chuckled.

Han Li felt a bit surprised, as he hadn't noticed this when he first entered the secret realm.

However, he didn't dwell on this and instead focused on activating the Time technique.

In an instant, the moon hung in the air, the mountains rose up, the rivers flowed, and the trees grew. The Five Elements Fantasy Realm appeared before him.

Mi Luo Old Ancestor scanned the surroundings, nodding in satisfaction. "Not bad, not bad. The five objects of the Time law haven't fully materialized, but you've already achieved this level of atmosphere. It's truly impressive. When the Five Elements are complete, the power of the Fantasy Realm will be even more extraordinary."

"I was planning to work on this earlier, but then some things happened, and I was delayed. I was also hindered by the evil corpse," Han Li said, feeling a bit embarrassed.

"You've already killed one corpse..." Mi Luo Old Ancestor's eyebrows furrowed slightly, and he pondered.

"What's wrong, Master? Is there something not quite right?" Han Li asked.

Mi Luo Old Ancestor thought for a moment before responding, "It's not that there's anything wrong, but you've already cultivated the Time law to this extent. I'm sure the ancient ones, including the Time Dao Ancestor, have already taken notice of you."

Han Li knew that the Time Dao Ancestor was a powerful figure in the Heavenly Court, and his name was enough to make his heart skip a beat.

"I've already been placed on the Heavenly Court's list of cultivators to be eliminated. As for whether the Time Dao Ancestor has noticed me, I'm not sure." Han Li smiled wryly.

"The struggle for the Dao is indeed perilous. I didn't have any intention of competing with the Time Dao Ancestor for the position of Dao Ancestor back then. I was just fascinated by the mysteries of the Time law. However, I was still suppressed by him. You, on the other hand, have a natural talent for the Time law that surpasses mine. It's impossible for you to go unnoticed." Mi Luo Old Ancestor said.

"Master, why didn't you want to compete for the position of Dao Ancestor?" Han Li asked, puzzled.

"Hehe, do you know why the Dao Ancestor is called the Dao Ancestor?" Mi Luo Old Ancestor asked with a smile.

"Because they have reached the pinnacle of the Dao, and can be called the Dao Ancestor." Han Li replied quickly.

"That's correct, but what does it mean to reach the pinnacle of the Dao?" Mi Luo Old Ancestor asked.

Han Li thought for a moment before responding, "I'm not sure."

"Reaching the pinnacle of the Dao means reaching the peak of the mountain. However, above this peak, there is still a vast expanse of sky. This sky is not something external, but rather the 'Dao' itself, which is the essence of all laws and principles. When one is beneath the 'Dao', all laws and techniques must be supported by the 'Dao' and are subject to its constraints. But when one becomes the Dao Ancestor, truly equal to the Dao, what happens?" Mi Luo Old Ancestor asked.

"Could it be that... when one becomes the Dao Ancestor, they will merge with the Dao, becoming a part of it?" Han Li asked, his forehead breaking out in cold sweat.

"According to my knowledge, becoming the Dao Ancestor doesn't immediately result in being devoured by the Dao. However, once the Dao Ancestor uses the power of the laws, they will draw upon the power of the Dao, and their abilities will be boundless. At the same time, they will accelerate their fusion with the Dao." Mi Luo Old Ancestor said.

"I see. So that's why Dao Ancestors rarely take action in the world," Han Li said, suddenly understanding.

"That's correct. However, when a threat to their position as Dao Ancestor arises, they will take action. And they may have some methods to delay their complete fusion with the Dao. The Time Dao Ancestor, Guo Yu, is one such existence." Mi Luo Old Ancestor said, looking at Han Li.

Han Li realized that Mi Luo Old Ancestor was worried about something.
