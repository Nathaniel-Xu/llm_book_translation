The Continent of Qitian, the Supplementing Heaven Sect.

On the Dragon Ascending Peak, the clouds were dense and obscured the mountain peak.

On the black stone altar at the peak, a swirling vortex of black fog churned and rolled, as if it had an endless attractive force.

In the center of the vortex, a withered old skull with a twisted face floated, unsupported and unattached, its hair on the front of its forehead had fallen out, and its sparse white hair on the back was disheveled and unkempt. It was motionless, like a sculpture.

After an unknown period of time, the skull's eyelids, which had been slightly closed, suddenly trembled and opened, revealing two pupils, one black and one white, the white one seemingly blind.

The old skull's eyebrows struggled to rise, and its one remaining eye gazed upwards.

A long, leafy branch of a peach tree stretched out from above, and a dense, spiral cloud of fog descended from the sky, brushing against the branch as it landed on the ground below the altar.

As the fog dispersed, a middle-aged man with a face like jade and a long, thin beard appeared, still wearing a wide, white robe and sitting in a wheelchair that seemed to be carved from white jade.

"Gu Daoist friend, I've already divined the fate, why have you come again?" The old skull spoke in a hoarse voice.

The man in the wheelchair was none other than the Time Dao Ancestor, Gu Huo Jin.

"The Bodhi Banquet is about to begin, and I'm feeling a bit uneasy, I need to divine the fate again." Gu Huo Jin adjusted the golden tassels on his waist and spoke slowly.

"I am one with the Heavenly Dao, and I'm only separated from it by this one fate. If I divine it, I'll be consumed by the Heavenly Dao, and what you promised me will be meaningless." Chen Po spoke in a calm and measured tone.

"This matter doesn't just concern you and me, if we succeed, it will be equivalent to raising the Heavenly Dao by three feet, and it will no longer oppress those of us who stand at the pinnacle. Don't you fear that you'll lose this fate and miss the opportunity?" Gu Huo Jin asked calmly.

Chen Po's face contorted in thought, and his eyes flashed with hesitation.

"This fate involves too many Dao Ancestors and Heavenly Dao energies, it's already beyond the realm of the Heavenly Fate. I can only divine half of it, and what result comes of it will depend on the will of Heaven." Chen Po said after a moment.

"Very well." Gu Huo Jin nodded without hesitation.

Chen Po didn't say anything else, and his mouth began to chant in a low voice.

Without the aid of his hands to form the seals, the time it took was twice as long as before, and the light in his one remaining eye slowly brightened, shooting out a beam of light that pierced the void.

After a long time, the light suddenly retracted, and the void returned to normal.

The vortex of fog behind Chen Po's old skull suddenly began to churn violently, and black crystal threads extended from it, crawling up his face like insects, covering his remaining eye and half of his face.

In an instant, his half-face was shrouded in darkness, and his one remaining eye was extinguished, leaving only a blind, half-face and a half-skull.

"How is it?" Gu Huo Jin asked, his brow furrowed slightly.

"The half-fate is unobstructed, but there is a change at the turning point... it's an anomaly." Chen Po's remaining half-face spoke in a faint, wavering voice.

"Anomaly?" Gu Huo Jin's eyes narrowed slightly.

Chen Po didn't speak, and the hair on the back of his head began to dance in the wind, which blew past the ancient peach tree, carrying hundreds of delicate flower petals down from its branches.

The petals fell to the ground, forming a large, shadowy figure with a rippling, watery light, and a faint, residual energy of the Time Dao.

Gu Huo Jin's wheelchair slowly moved forward, stopping beside the flower petal shadow.

"Korean Li." He spoke softly, his eyes fixed on the shadow.

"The Master of the Wheel of Reincarnation is also subject to the Heavenly Fate, this anomaly at the Bodhi Banquet... it's just this one person." Chen Po's voice was hoarse and faint, echoing through the void.

"Hmph, since you've divined it, it's no longer an anomaly. I'll take care of it myself, and it will be a trivial matter." Gu Huo Jin leaned back in his wheelchair, a hint of a smile on his face.

In his eyes, Han Li had already reached the pinnacle of the Time Dao, and was only a step away from him. As for the exploration of the Dao, Han Li was far beyond him, and their struggle was hardly worth mentioning.

"Very good, then it's settled..." Chen Po spoke slowly.

Gu Huo Jin waved his hand, dispersing the flower petal shadow, and a cloud of fog began to gather beneath him.

Just as he was about to leave, his expression suddenly changed, and a faint smile appeared on his face.

"The Heavenly Court has a noble guest, it seems I'll have to return and receive them. The matter of eliminating this anomaly will have to be entrusted to someone else." Gu Huo Jin spoke, his eyes gleaming with a hint of amusement.

"The anomaly is best handled by you personally." Chen Po cautioned.

"A single Ten Directions, Ten Thousand Immortals Array, will it be enough?"
The mystery of the past and present was left with only one question, and the figure had already risen into the air, disappearing into the clouds.

Chen Poun, the elder, let out a soft sigh and habitually closed his blind eyes.

The ancient peach tree, over 4,000 years old, gently swayed, and petals fell like rain.

...

In the Eastern Heaven of the Middle Earth, on the Eastern Victory Continent.

A vast ocean stretched out, with countless islands of varying sizes scattered across it, like stars in the sky. Not far from the eastern coast of the Eastern Victory Continent, two islands stood out, each with a white jade pillar tens of thousands of feet high, adorned with intricate carvings of auspicious clouds that rose into the sky.

Through the blue sky and the thick, white clouds, a three-tiered pavilion with a flying eave could be seen, with a massive, crimson banner hanging from the center, inscribed with the words "Ying Tian Men" in gold, seal script.

This was the Eastern Heaven Gate of the Middle Earth.

At this moment, the majestic Eastern Heaven Gate was surrounded by nearly a million soldiers, all clad in gold and silver armor.

Behind these soldiers, every hundred miles or so, stood a giant, tens of thousands of feet tall, with a bare upper body, holding a massive, heavenly axe. Each of them gazed out with fierce eyes.

Far away, in the void, and on the islands below, stood tens of thousands of soldiers, armed with various weapons.

However, unlike the heavenly army, these soldiers' armor was not uniform, appearing somewhat disorganized.

On the surface of the ocean, beyond the soldiers, stood numerous, diverse, and bizarre creatures, their bodies swaying with the waves. In the depths of the ocean, beneath them, massive shadows could be seen, slowly moving.

Behind the army of soldiers, a fleet of spirit ships, of varying sizes and shapes, floated on the surface of the water, their hulls inscribed with complex, glowing symbols that continuously absorbed the spiritual energy of the surroundings, accumulating power.

At the center of the fleet, a massive, dark red spirit ship stood out, with a three-tiered palace built upon it. The palace's courtyard was packed with people.

The leader of these people was a tall, black-robed man, wearing a combat cap, none other than the Master of the Wheel of Reincarnation.

"Master..."

The people behind him simultaneously bowed, as if sending him off.

"Everything will proceed according to plan." The Master of the Wheel of Reincarnation turned his head and instructed.

"Yes." Everyone responded in unison.

The Master of the Wheel of Reincarnation then ignored the crowd and flew towards the Eastern Heaven Gate, his body surrounded by a brilliant light.

The heavenly army guarding the Eastern Heaven Gate saw him approaching and immediately became agitated, drawing their arms, as if facing a great enemy.

However, the Master of the Wheel of Reincarnation did not intend to force his way through, instead stopping in mid-air.

The heavenly generals looked at each other, unsure of what he planned to do.

"Isn't it that Guo or Jin invited me to a banquet? I've arrived, and this is how you welcome me?" The Master of the Wheel of Reincarnation asked with a smile.

His voice was not loud, but it carried an inexplicable, piercing power, like the sound of a great bell resonating within the hearts of every heavenly soldier, causing their souls to tremble.

However, the Master of the Wheel of Reincarnation did not intend to harm the army with this method, but rather to ensure that his words reached the ears of those who needed to hear them.

In the central mountains of the Eastern Victory Continent, a small, white, Taoist temple was hidden amidst a dense forest.

Inside the temple's three-story library, a middle-aged man, dressed in a black and white Taoist robe, was studying a blue, leather-bound book, his brow furrowed in concentration.

The man's face was thin, with a clear, bright gaze, a straight nose, and thin lips. He had a long, white beard, and his appearance was not particularly handsome, but he had a certain, dignified air about him.

As he read, he would occasionally stroke his beard, and when he came across something interesting, he would nod his head repeatedly.

"Such an encounter, I never thought... Unfortunately, these worldly people's understanding of the Tao is so simplistic, they think that by stumbling upon ancient texts, they can gain mastery over the Tao. They believe that by entering deep mountains, they can find magical artifacts, and by exploring deep valleys, they can meet enlightened beings. In the end, it's all just... wishful thinking."

The thin man put down the book, and the pages automatically closed, revealing the title, "The Mortal's Path to Immortality," written by a worldly scholar named "Wang Yu." It was not a sacred text, but rather a work of fiction based on popular legends.

Just then, the thin man's brow furrowed, and he said to himself, "He's arrived..."

(To all my fellow Taoist friends, happy Chinese New Year, and may the Year of the Rat bring you great fortune!)
