"How was your harvest?" Han Li looked at Xiao Bai and Lan Yan.

"Fully loaded and returning, I didn't expect the Ghost Spirit's lair to have so many treasures!" Xiao Bai exclaimed, waving his fist excitedly.

Lan Yan's eyes also flashed with excitement, but quickly suppressed it, taking out a storage artifact and handing it to Han Li with both hands, saying softly, "Han Daoist, this is what I gathered from three rooms."

"Take one-tenth of it, consider it your reward." Han Li didn't take the storage artifact, saying calmly.

"Thank you, Han Daoist." Lan Yan heard this and her eyes flashed with excitement.

The items inside the storage artifact were priceless, even one-tenth of it would be a huge fortune for her, and for her past self, it was something she couldn't even dare to think about.

"As for you, Xiao Bai..." Han Li looked at Xiao Bai.

"Master, these things were found by me, you can't take them!" Xiao Bai covered his wrist with the storage bracelet.

"I know, but I need Sanyuan stones recently, take half of them, and leave the other half for me." Han Li smiled wryly and said.

Xiao Bai cheered and took out another storage artifact, starting to rearrange the items inside.

"Master, I have something to ask for your help." Qiuhun suddenly spoke up.

"What is it?" Han Li asked.

"Master, please follow me." Qiuhun said, turning to the black crystal coffin in the center of the stone room's formation.

Han Li only remembered the crystal coffin now, and walked over.

Just now, he was too busy searching for Jintong and the treasures in the rooms, and had momentarily forgotten about this.

He looked inside the coffin, and his expression changed slightly.

 Inside the crystal coffin lay a white skeleton, covered in dark talismans, looking very sinister, especially the two black holes in the skeleton's eye sockets, which flashed with two points of crimson flames, emitting a circle of blood light.

The entire skeleton emitted a extremely evil aura, as if it was the embodiment of all evil in the world.

Han Li's suppressed evil corpse stirred, as if it was being summoned, and he quickly looked away, only to return to normal.

"This skeleton is so sinister, do you recognize it?" Han Li asked after calming down.

"If I'm not mistaken, this skeleton should be the Wicked Skeleton, collected from countless people in the world who have committed evil deeds, and using their bodies and souls to cultivate with secret techniques, it would be of great help in beheading evil corpses." Qiuhun said excitedly.

"There's actually something like this." Han Li's eyebrows rose.

"Master, this thing is very useful to us, with this Wicked Skeleton, it would be much easier for us to behead evil corpses. However, this crystal coffin is fixed in place, and to take it out without harming the Wicked Skeleton, we need to break the formation around it. This formation is very powerful, and requires your help, Master." Qiuhun said.

"No problem, you just cast your spell to take the skeleton, and I'll help you break the formation." Han Li said after hearing this.

"Then I'll trouble you, Master, with the power of the Heavenly Thunder, it shouldn't be difficult to break the formation." Qiuhun said, then immediately began casting her spell.

A surge of dark energy erupted from her body, merging with the formation on the ground.

The formation's patterns were stimulated, and a bright light appeared, rapidly spinning and humming.

Eight black chains emerged from the ground, connecting to the crystal coffin, locking it in place, each chain emitting a terrifying cold aura.

Qiuhun spat out a white light, which split into eight, merging with the eight black chains.

The eight black chains immediately turned half black and half white, and the cold aura emitted by them greatly decreased.

Furthermore, a layer of separation appeared between the crystal coffin and the eight chains, isolating them.

"Master, now is the time, cut the chains!" Qiuhun shouted.

Han Li, hearing this, expressionless, snapped his fingers, and eight golden lights shot out from his hand, precisely the eight Qingtong Wuyun swords, striking the eight chains.

The eight chains shattered, and the black crystal coffin burst out with a dazzling black light, flying out from the ground.

Qiuhun's eyes lit up with joy, and she reached out with an empty hand, a giant black palm appearing, grasping the black crystal coffin.

At the same time, she waved her other hand, and a dark red three-legged cauldron appeared, which was the Yanluo Cauldron Han Li had given her earlier.

A dark red light shot out from the Yanluo Cauldron, enveloping the black crystal coffin, and in a flash, the coffin disappeared, taken into the Yanluo Cauldron's space.

"Thank you, Master, for your help." Qiuhun's face relaxed, then bowed to Han Li.

"It was nothing, and this thing is also useful to me, no need to thank me." Han Li said calmly.

At this moment, Xiao Bai and Lan Yan also flew over, handing two storage artifacts to Han Li.
Han Li took over the storage devices, and upon examining them, a hint of joy appeared on his face.

The two storage devices contained many treasures, mostly spiritual herbs and materials from demon beasts, and the quantity was substantial. However, Han Li's most desired item, the Celestial Yuan Stone, was not among them.

This was to be expected, as the Celestial Yuan Stone was a lightweight item that would likely be carried on one's person. The items stored in the devices were probably those that were not frequently used but took up a lot of space.

Ghost Spirit's true treasures were likely stored in the devices.

However, Han Li was not too concerned, as the items he had obtained could be sold for seven or eight million Celestial Yuan Stones.

"We've wasted enough time, let's go, and pursue Qu Lin," Han Li said, turning around and heading back the way they came.

The group quickly followed, and soon they returned to the previously collapsed stone chamber.

The passageway back was blocked by the collapsed giant stones, but the group easily removed the stones and continued their pursuit. They soon arrived at a fork in the road.

Han Li immediately activated his Nine Yin Demon Eyes, examining the spiritual energy traces in the area. His brow suddenly furrowed.

The spiritual energy traces were scarce, and they were all from when he, Lan Yuan, and Qu Lin had passed through the area earlier. However, there was no sign of Qu Lin's energy traces from when he had turned back. It was as if he had used some method to conceal his tracks, and his technique was incredibly skillful.

Moreover, Qu Lin had previously lured them into the trap, and even the usually perceptive Qi Hou had not detected his malicious intentions. This showed that Qu Lin's hiding techniques were extremely deep.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he activated his Nine Yin Demon Eyes to their fullest extent, determined to see whether Qu Lin's concealment techniques were superior or his own eyes were more powerful.

A faint, purple-black glow flashed in his eyes, forming two whirlpools that gazed forward.

After a moment, Han Li's face lit up with joy, as his Nine Yin Demon Eyes had finally detected a faint, golden glow emanating from the passageway.

The golden glow was fragmented and extremely faint, and if not for his Nine Yin Demon Eyes being nearly perfected, he would not have been able to detect it.

"Master, can you find Qu Lin's trail?" Qi Hou asked.

"Not yet, follow me," Han Li replied, leading the group along the golden glow's trail.

As they proceeded, they found themselves in a vast network of underground tunnels, resembling a spider's web, with passageways stretching out in all directions.

The group had been walking for half a day, and they still had not reached the end of the tunnels. The air was no longer cold, and they had clearly left the Ghost Valley's range behind.

Along the way, they encountered some restrictions and obstacles, but they were not particularly formidable, and many had been broken, not hindering Han Li's group.

"Lan Yuan, do you know why these underground tunnels are so extensive? Is there a special purpose to them?" Han Li asked Lan Yuan.

"I was not of high rank in the Nine Yuan Sect, and I only visited this place a few times. I don't know the secrets of the sect," Lan Yuan replied with a bitter smile.

Han Li nodded, not pressing the issue, and continued forward.

As they flew through the tunnels, the passageway ahead suddenly lit up with a multitude of golden glows, intertwined and chaotic.

The golden glows contained fluctuations of the golden laws, and a majestic, mountain-like aura emanated from them.

Han Li's eyes flashed, and he stopped in his tracks.

"Have we finally reached the end?" Qi Hou and the others asked, halting behind him.

"I'm not sure, but since there's a change ahead, we can't be careless. You all should stay hidden in the Flower Branch Space, prepared for any unexpected events. I'll use magic to project the outside situation into the Flower Branch Space, so you can rest assured," Han Li said, his expression serious, as he opened the entrance to the Flower Branch Space.

Qi Hou and Lan Yuan entered the space, followed by Xiao Bai, who was somewhat reluctant but eventually complied after glancing at Han Li.

With the three of them hidden, Han Li activated his black mask, concealing his presence, and proceeded forward, soon arriving at the end of the tunnel.

There, he found a wall of gold, crafted from a golden mineral, and the golden glows emanated from it.

As he drew closer, he could feel the intense golden laws emanating from the wall.

"This is the Heavenly Gold Rock!" Han Li exclaimed.

The Heavenly Gold Rock was a material imbued with the golden laws, although it was not as valuable as the Heavenly Gold Drill, it was still extremely precious. He had not expected to find such a large quantity of it here, and if he were to sell it, it would be worth a considerable amount.

He chuckled to himself, realizing that he had been too focused on accumulating wealth lately, and that he should not be so greedy.

Han Li composed himself, and his gaze fell upon a small, fist-sized hole in the corner of the golden wall.

The hole seemed to have been torn open, and it led to a narrow, winding tunnel. The air emanating from the tunnel was faintly lit, suggesting that there was another world beyond the wall.

However, the wall was enchanted, and when Han Li's spiritual sense approached, it was repelled by an invisible force, preventing him from exploring the situation within.
