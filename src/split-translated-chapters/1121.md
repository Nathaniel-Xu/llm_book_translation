At the critical moment, Han Li could only resort to using the full force of the Heaven Severing Prison Technique, lifting one arm and striking forward with a powerful fist.

A layer of golden ripples emerged from the tip of his fist, followed by a series of blurred shadows that transformed into multiple layers of fist silhouettes, each one welcoming the incoming five-colored light ball.

As the two collided, the golden ripple condensed fist silhouettes exploded one after another, but the time law contained within them was unable to stop the five-colored light ball's relentless advance, failing to buy Han Li much time.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he pinched his sword fingers, and the 36 green bamboo swords merged into a single entity in his hand.

He didn't have time to wield the sword, so he could only use his hand to block the sword's body, using the long sword to deflect the attack.

At the same time, a golden electric light burst forth from the sword's body, like a giant golden lightning bolt, wrapping around the five-colored light ball and hindering its progress.

A series of electric current sounds echoed out, as the golden electric threads on the sword's body continued to surge and dissipate, entangling the two in a seesaw battle.

Jiao San and Huo San saw this and immediately rushed to Han Li's side, standing behind him to prevent Qi Mozi from striking again.

However, Qi Mozi retreated after his attack, disappearing into the distance and landing on a massive boulder several hundred meters away, with Xiong Shan hiding behind it, his face filled with fear.

After a few moments, the five-colored light ball's power finally began to wane.

Han Li saw this and raised his sword, deflecting the light ball into the air.

"Qi Mozi..." Han Li's brow furrowed, a hint of coldness flashing in his eyes as he gazed in Qi Mozi's direction.

Just then, a sudden change occurred.

A dark figure suddenly appeared beside Han Li, without any spiritual energy fluctuations or ripples, and grasped his sword-wielding arm.

The figure was none other than Hei Tian Mo Zu, who had mysteriously appeared from the Wuxing Yuankong Great Array, leaving Han Li and the others stunned.

"How is this possible..."

Han Li turned to look at Hei Tian Mo Zu, his throat drying up.

At this moment, Hei Tian Mo Zu's aura was even more majestic and refined, as if he had washed away his impurities in the Wuxing Yuankong Great Array, becoming even more pure and spirited.

"Heh heh, young one, I didn't expect you to still be able to use the Great Five Elements Fantasy Technique. Come, let's exchange a few blows..." Hei Tian Mo Zu said with a smile, his words devoid of any joking tone.

"Senior, please don't joke around, I'm no match for you." Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he tried to withdraw his arm, but to no avail, so he could only use the Nine Underworld Demon Eye to try and find an opening in Hei Tian Mo Zu's defenses.

However, Hei Tian Mo Zu immediately discovered his attempt.

"Heh heh, you actually know the Saint Tribe's Spirit Eye secret technique, how rare, how rare indeed..." Hei Tian Mo Zu's face showed a hint of normal expression, nodding his head.

Han Li's heart tightened at these words.

But Hei Tian Mo Zu's brow suddenly furrowed, and he continued, "Young one, who did you learn from? How do you know the Heaven Severing Prison Technique, the Saint Tribe's highest cultivation method?"

"Senior, you are all-knowing, I dare not hide it. My master is the True Word Sect's Mi Luo Old Ancestor, I don't know if senior has heard of him?" Han Li replied, his voice trembling with fear.

"Ah, that's right, your main cultivation method is the Great Five Elements Fantasy Technique, and your master is Mi Luo Old Ancestor, that fat monk. Heh heh, I guessed it correctly, I guessed it correctly..." Hei Tian Mo Zu's face lit up with joy, his eyes sparkling with delight.

He looked like a child who had just solved a puzzle, his excitement uncontainable.

"Senior, you are truly all-knowing, I am deeply impressed. But senior, since you have already confirmed the answer, please release me." Han Li quickly flattered, trying to appease Hei Tian Mo Zu.

Hei Tian Mo Zu was indeed pleased by Han Li's words.

"You young one may not look impressive, but your eyes are not bad. As for my knowledge, naturally, there are few people who can match it! Now, is there anything you don't understand? Come, ask me, I'll break the rules and enlighten you." Hei Tian Mo Zu released his grip on Han Li's arm, beaming with pride.

"I dare not trouble senior, I have nothing to ask." Han Li flexed his wrist, his brow furrowed in concern, unsure of what to do next.

"Impossible, I'm not someone who speaks nonsense! Since I told you to ask, you must ask!" Hei Tian Mo Zu's face darkened, his voice stern.

Jiao San and Huo San stood on either side of Han Li, mere meters away from Hei Tian Mo Zu, their eyes wide with shock, unsure of what to do next, stuck in an awkward situation.
Not far away, Qi Mozi watched this scene, first slightly stunned, then a thoughtful expression appeared on his face, and a faint smile appeared on his lips.

Lei Yuze and others were the most miserable, wanting to escape but unable to escape, and could only take advantage of Han Li being entangled with the Black Sky Demon Ancestor to secretly give Dao Yin a medicinal pill to guide his injuries.

"Since the senior has already spoken, I have a matter to ask, I don't know if the senior has seen a creature called the Golden Devouring Immortal?" Han Li suddenly remembered something and asked respectfully.

Regarding Qu Lin, who had disappeared after entering the seventh layer, Han Li had always been a bit worried.

Although the two had a prior agreement, the current situation was changing too quickly, making him feel a bit out of control.

"I've seen him," the Black Sky Demon Ancestor said without hesitation.

"Where?" Han Li asked quickly.

"It's been too long, I've forgotten. But that guy was quite resilient, I used to beat him up when I was bored, and as it happens, he hasn't appeared in a long time." The Black Sky Demon Ancestor frowned and said.

Han Li's heart moved, Qu Lin had mentioned that he had entered the seventh layer and was beaten up by an old madman.

"That's not right, senior, you've been imprisoned on the altar of the Time Temple, how could you have seen him?" Han Li questioned.

"You say I'm imprisoned? What nonsense! I just thought that place was quiet and no one would disturb me, so I could sleep peacefully, and I can come out whenever I want!" The Black Sky Demon Ancestor shouted angrily.

"Originally, it was my mistake," Han Li said, as if he had thought of something.

Earlier, when he had observed the inside of the altar through the opening created by Jiao San, he had felt that the seal imprisoning the Black Sky Demon Ancestor had some strange aspects, and now that he thought about it, he didn't know why, but the seal seemed to have lost its original effect.

After all, if the demon head was really imprisoned and his cultivation was being slowly drained away, the fluctuations inside the seal would not be so calm, but when he first saw it and scanned it with his divine sense, he indeed felt that the seal was too calm.

"This is a ridiculous question, you should ask something more challenging," the Black Sky Demon Ancestor scolded.

"More challenging?" Han Li asked doubtfully.

"For example, about cultivation problems, but... this seems to be not that difficult, this is a bit troublesome..." The Black Sky Demon Ancestor scratched his head, looking a bit troubled.

"I dare to ask, senior, when I was cultivating the Nine Yin Demon Eyes, the manual described 'reaching the ninth heaven and penetrating the ninth underworld', it can be seen that this spirit eye technique is extraordinary, why can't I see through many of the illusions and seals in the towers?" Han Li's eyebrows were slightly raised, and he asked with a try-it-out attitude.

"This question is not that difficult, but I can barely answer it. When you cultivated the Nine Yin Demon Eyes, did you introduce demonic energy?" The Black Sky Demon Ancestor waved his hand and asked.

"This spirit eye technique is based on demonic energy to purify the eyes, I naturally introduced it," Han Li replied truthfully.

"That's right, you cultivated a demonic technique, so you naturally used your own demonic energy, rather than borrowing external demonic energy, so it's not a problem with the purity of the demonic energy. So, the problem should be with the other spirit eye techniques you cultivated," the Black Sky Demon Ancestor said after a brief moment of consideration.

His expression was very serious and focused when answering the question, and he no longer had the crazy appearance from before.

"Senior, you are truly insightful, I indeed cultivated other spirit eye techniques," Han Li said, his heart slightly moved, and he praised again. He had previously cultivated the Bright Clear Spirit Eyes, and later, through cultivation, he had made some progress, and now it seemed that his two spirit eye techniques did have some conflicts.

"The cultivation paths of the two spirit eye techniques are fundamentally different, and there are some conflicts between them, just..." The Black Sky Demon Ancestor's next few words immediately resolved Han Li's doubts.

"Thank you, senior. I still have one thing I don't understand, I don't know why you sealed this place and left us here," Han Li asked, his mind now at ease.

But unexpectedly, the Black Sky Demon Ancestor was stunned when he heard this question.

He saw him rubbing his chin, walking back and forth, and falling into deep thought.

"What was I going to do? What was I going to do, I was going to..." A moment later, he sat down on the ground, muttering to himself.

Everyone saw this scene and couldn't help but feel a bit ridiculous.

After a while, the Black Sky Demon Ancestor seemed to suddenly remember something, and his face changed, revealing a look of urgency.

"I know, I know... I'm looking for my wife and child, have you seen them? Do you know where they are?" the Black Sky Demon Ancestor asked hastily.

Han Li heard this and looked at the man with disheveled hair, and his heart couldn't help but move slightly.

"Sorry, I don't know," he shook his head and said.
