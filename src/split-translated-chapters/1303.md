Under the gaze of Han Li and Jiao San, the rolling dark red sun suddenly went into a frenzy of violent convulsions.

The next moment, the sun seemed to have come to life as it rapidly expanded and contracted, its rhythm growing faster and faster!

Han Li watched all of this with his eyes, his pupils suddenly contracting sharply.

Almost at the same time, a large patch of white light burst forth from the surface of the sun, and the entire sun suddenly split into two, transforming into a trail of residual light that scattered in all directions.

The skeletal figure of Gu Huang emerged, seemingly unscathed, with not even a single thread of his long robes torn.

His eyes blazed with fierce soul fire, but he did not make another move.

After several exchanges that ended in a stalemate, it was clear that he had put aside his underestimation of the two humans who had originally been beneath his notice.

Although they appeared to be only at the Mahayana stage, with a vast gap between them, the Great Reincarnation Array was incredibly powerful, allowing the two of them to resist Gu Huang's attacks.

At this moment, Xue Li, the black-faced giant, and the black-robed specter flew over from a distance, landing beside Gu Huang.

"Gu Huang, are you alright?" the black-faced giant asked with concern.

Gu Huang did not respond, instead raising his hand and unleashing a burst of blinding white light from his palm.

"Rumble, rumble!"

The entire sky immediately churned and rolled once more, as countless white bone lights descended from the heavens, intertwining and forming a massive tidal wave that crashed down upon the gray-white stone temple.

The gray-white stone temple and the surrounding dark red light shield were shaken once more, as if a lone boat in a stormy sea, seeming to totter on the brink of collapse.

Han Li and Jiao San's faces changed, and they simultaneously raised their hands, using the Law of Resonance to try and stabilize the Great Reincarnation Array.

However, after releasing this massive wave of white bone light, Gu Huang did not seize the opportunity to attack, instead turning his head to gaze at the black-robed specter and saying in a cold voice, "Gui Wu, stop pretending. You've possessed the body of the black-robed cultivator, thinking that I wouldn't notice."

"Hehe, indeed, I couldn't hide it from Gu Huang," the black-robed specter said with a laugh, his body shrinking rapidly as he transformed into a gray-robed man, revealed to be Gui Wu.

Xue Li and the black-faced giant were shocked by this scene.

"Earlier, in the midst of the storm, my residual soul was on the verge of annihilation, and I was forced to possess the body of the black-robed cultivator to save myself. I beg Gu Huang's pardon for this transgression," Gui Wu said, bowing to Gu Huang.

"You know that I'm not at liberty to use my full strength. Go and kill that human cultivator for me, and I'll forgive you for possessing the body. You've been by his side for a long time, so don't tell me you haven't collected his aura seed," Gu Huang said coldly.

"Of course, I have no problem with that. Since he's joined the Turning Wheel King, he's an enemy of the Nether Realm. Gu Huang has shown me great kindness, and I'll do my best to repay it," Gui Wu said with a smile, before spitting out a small gray light.

A small, gray-black figurine emerged, no larger than a few inches, and incredibly lifelike.

However, the figurine's face had no features, giving it an eerie appearance.

Gui Wu took out a gray talisman, upon which was inscribed a circular symbol, seemingly a sealing technique. The center of the symbol flashed with a golden light, emitting Han Li's aura.

Gui Wu stuck the talisman to the blank face of the figurine, and the talisman shattered with a "ripping" sound, releasing countless gray symbols that wrapped around the golden light, merging with the figurine's body.

The figurine's body shook violently, as if it was about to come to life, and its face flashed with a faint light, revealing a face that was vaguely similar to Han Li's.

Inside the dark red light shield, Han Li suddenly looked up, gazing towards the depths of the white bone light, a look of confusion on his face.

"You're the one who's walking into this trap, so don't blame me for being ruthless."

Gui Wu muttered to himself, a cruel smile spreading across his face, as he raised his other hand, revealing seven black needles that shone with a dark, eerie light.

He snapped his fingers, and the seven black needles shot out, piercing the figurine's chest, heart, and other vital points, emerging from the other side.

The figurine's body burst forth with seven streams of blood, scattering everywhere, and a stream of blood flowed from its mouth.

Inside the light shield, Han Li's body suddenly experienced seven simultaneous explosions of blood, as if his body had been pierced by seven invisible needles.

Moreover, his mind was filled with intense pain, as seven blurry black needle shadows pierced his soul.

Han Li let out a cry of pain, spitting out a mouthful of blood, his aura plummeting.

"Han Li, what's happening to you?" Jiao San asked in alarm, seeing Han Li's condition.

Han Li did not respond, his eyes closed, his face twisted in agony.

At this moment, seven sinister forces were rampaging through his mind, threatening to destroy his soul.

He felt his head swelling with pain, as if it was about to explode, and his mind was filled with an unbearable agony.

Fortunately, his soul was incredibly strong, and he did not collapse, as a massive golden light burst forth, enveloping his body.

A vast, temporal law enveloped his body, and the seven wounds on his body stopped bleeding, while the seven black needle shadows in his mind faded significantly, and the pain in his mind diminished.

Han Li let out a sigh of relief, opening his eyes, and waving his hand gently.

A silvery light flashed, and the ghostly figures of Ti Hu and others appeared.

"Go and help Jiao San guard the seal!"

Han Li said quickly, before turning his attention to his own body, sitting down in a cross-legged position, and using the Five Elements Fantastical World Technique and the Refining Spirit Technique to refine the seven sinister forces within his mind.
The time law that had been assisting Han Li was gone, and the power of the Reincarnation Array had greatly decreased. The dark red light screen's radiance plummeted, and under the impact of the surrounding white bone light, it began to shake violently once more.

Jiao San saw this and hastily made a hand seal, using all his strength to stabilize the light screen.

However, a massive force from outside transmitted into him, striking Jiao San and making his face turn pale in an instant.

Tie Hun and the others didn't know what to do, so they could only use their hands to block the invasive forces, sharing some of the pressure on Jiao San.

Outside the light screen, Gui Wu's brow was furrowed as he gazed at the puppet in front of him.

The fresh blood on the puppet's body had stopped flowing, and Han Li's facial features had dimmed, but hadn't disappeared.

"Hmm, it's actually not dead? How rare," Gui Wu muttered.

Blood Li, who was standing beside him, coldly laughed and said, "Enough, everyone, let's work together to break this Reincarnation Array in one go!"

Guhuang loudly shouted, his voice urgent, as if he was anxious. He waved his hand, and a massive white bone mountain appeared behind him, composed of countless skeletal remains, emitting a powerful and intense law fluctuation.

Next, a massive white bone claw emerged from the mountain, grasping the dark red light screen.

Blood Li also let out a long cry, and an endless amount of blood light surged out of his body, forming a blood cloud that covered the sky.

He swung the massive axe in his hand, and the blood cloud instantly gathered together, forming a massive blood axe that spanned the sky, with scorching hot electricity crackling on the blade.

As Blood Li swung the axe, the blood axe in the air also descended, striking the light screen.

Almost at the same time, the black-faced big man once again used his divine ability, summoning the two-headed, four-armed ghost king.

The ghost king's four fists were enveloped in a dark glow, and then suddenly became blurry.

Countless fist silhouettes appeared, rapidly striking the Reincarnation Array.

Gui Wu wasn't skilled in physical attacks, but he also spat out a black light beam that struck the dark red light screen.

The four people's attacks simultaneously landed on the dark red light screen, causing a deafening explosion.

Jiao San's body violently trembled, and blood gushed out of her seven orifices.

However, her eyes shone brightly, and she used all her strength to activate the Reincarnation Array, without any intention of retreating.

The dark red light screen violently flashed, rapidly becoming thin, and was on the verge of shattering.

The palace below also appeared to be on the verge of collapse, with cracks spreading across its surface.

At this moment, a massive power surged out from the palace below, pouring into the Reincarnation Array.

The Reincarnation Array burst forth with a dark red light, emitting a sharp, ear-piercing whine, as if it was cheering in joy.

The dark red light screen instantly recovered, becoming even thicker, and countless dark red light beams shot out, causing a deafening explosion. The attacks from Guhuang and the others were directly repelled.

Guhuang's body shook violently, and he stumbled back two steps before regaining his balance. The light on his body flashed wildly, revealing his shock.

Blood Li and the others were even more miserable, being directly blown away.

Jiao San saw this and finally relaxed, her tense nerves easing. However, her body's injuries and exhaustion finally caught up with her, and she fell towards the ground.

A dark red light suddenly appeared, supporting Jiao San's body, and a figure emerged beside her – the master of the Reincarnation Hall.

"Hall Master, is it... over?" Jiao San asked, her eyes shining with difficulty.

"Jiuzhen, you've worked hard. Rest well, and let me handle the rest," the Reincarnation Hall Master said softly, waving his hand.

Jiao San felt a massive, warm energy flow into her body, circulating once before disappearing.

Her injuries were completely healed, and her depleted spiritual energy was restored to nearly half. She stood up, overjoyed.

Tie Hun and the others, who hadn't been injured, also changed their expressions upon seeing the Reincarnation Hall Master's imposing manner. They flew to Han Li's side, standing guard.

Han Li's body flashed with golden light, and he stood up, looking at the Reincarnation Hall Master with a dazed expression.

The person before him had a blurry face, and Han Li couldn't see his features, but for some reason, he felt a strange sense of familiarity.

The Reincarnation Hall Master glanced at Han Li, then quickly shifted his gaze to Guhuang, saying, "Guhuang, it's been a long time."

"I've always wanted to see you, but unfortunately, I never had the chance," Guhuang said coldly.

"The current timing seems to be quite good," the Reincarnation Hall Master said.

"It's not just good, it's a rare opportunity! You're not even a match for me in terms of cultivation, and now you're weakened. Can you still be my opponent?" Guhuang's eyes flashed with soul fire as he spoke.

"I didn't expect you to still be so reckless, even using the Dao Ancestor's power to activate the law. It seems the Six Paths Reincarnation Disk is quite enticing to you," the Reincarnation Hall Master said, his figure moving as he flew out of the dark red light screen.
