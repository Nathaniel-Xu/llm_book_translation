Han Li smiled and said, "You're still as I first saw you, making me think you're a heavenly being."

Nan Gong Wan said, "When I first met you, I didn't think you had such reverence for heavenly beings. That time with the Ink Dragon, you..."

Nan Gong Wan realized she had misspoken and quickly stopped talking. Her face turned red, and two red clouds appeared on her cheeks.

Han Li pulled her into his arms, a nostalgic look in his eyes, and said slowly, "Speaking of which, I should thank that Ink Dragon. If I hadn't mistaken its libido pouch for a dragon pill, you and I..."

"Quickly, don't say it..." Even though they were already dao companions, Nan Gong Wan still felt embarrassed. She raised a finger to Han Li's lips, stopping him from continuing.

The sunlight filtered through the trees, casting a warm glow on the two of them. Birds sang in the distance, and the mountain wind rustled through the leaves. Han Li didn't continue speaking, instead, he gently hugged Nan Gong Wan, enjoying the rare moment of peace.

...

Half a month passed.

The Absolute Mortal Realm, under the jurisdiction of the Nan Lin Immortal Domain, was the smallest and weakest of all the realms under the immortal domains. It was a place where ordinary mortals lived, and even those with spiritual roots were rare.

Due to the scarcity of spiritual energy, spiritual herbs and medicine were also rare, and cultivation resources were scarce. Even those who had reached the Foundation Establishment stage were rare, and those who had reached the Nascent Soul stage were like gods, standing at the pinnacle of this realm.

Therefore, this realm was still dominated by the secular world, with more emphasis on martial arts and temple politics.

As for the powerful immortal factions, they were like gods, only appearing in rumors and stories.

Therefore, it was rare to see cultivators fighting each other in this realm, as it was already difficult to cultivate, and their lifespan was limited.

But on this day, the first immortal sect in the northern region, the Hidden Mountain Sect, was attacked by a mortal enemy.

The mortal enemy was only a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, far inferior to the current sect master of the Hidden Mountain Sect, who had already reached the late stage of Foundation Establishment decades ago.

Logically, he shouldn't have dared to attack the sect.

However, the fact was that he not only attacked the sect but also used his bone flute to control a large number of poisonous insects, killing almost everyone in the sect.

If it were just ordinary poisonous insects, it wouldn't have been a problem. However, among the poisonous insects were many rare spiritual insects, including twenty-eight immature Golden Devouring Insects.

After the battle, only the sect master and a few severely injured elders remained, cornered by the mortal enemy at the ancestral hall of the sect's founder.

The sect master, a short, white-haired man with a childish appearance, had his right shoulder and arm devoured by the Golden Devouring Insects.

"It's just because of a mistake you made back then, causing you to fail in your breakthrough. Why do you have to go to such extremes?" the sect master asked, his face pale with anger.

The mortal enemy stopped playing his bone flute, and the poisonous insects temporarily stopped attacking.

"This realm's spiritual energy is limited, and it's not enough to support many Nascent Soul stage cultivators. You blocked my breakthrough, and I fear I'll never be able to break through again. You say this grudge, should it be avenged?" the mortal enemy coldly said.

"Even so, you've already destroyed my sect. Shouldn't you stop now?" the sect master pleaded.

"I'm not done yet. As long as you're alive, my revenge won't be complete." The mortal enemy continued, "I'll kill you, and then your sect will be truly destroyed."

The mortal enemy blew his bone flute again, and the poisonous insects surrounding the sect master and the elders began to move once more.

Just then, a faint tremor seemed to occur in the heavens, and everyone felt it for a moment. However, no one paid attention, as everything returned to normal immediately after.

The mortal enemy's control over the poisonous insects suddenly faltered, and the insects began to riot. The ordinary poisonous insects didn't react, but the spiritual insects, including the Golden Devouring Insects, broke free from the mortal enemy's control.

The mortal enemy was shocked and tried to regain control over the spiritual insects with all his might.

However, as he did so, the spiritual insects suddenly turned on him, led by the twenty-eight Golden Devouring Insects.

A blood-curdling scream echoed through the air, and the mortal enemy's body was torn apart, leaving only a bloody skeleton behind.

The survivors of the Hidden Mountain Sect were shocked and terrified, but they soon realized that the spiritual insects had no intention of attacking them. Instead, they flew away, and the poisonous insects dispersed.

The survivors looked at each other in confusion, unsure of what had just happened.

Meanwhile, at the top of a majestic mountain peak in the central region of the Absolute Mortal Realm, a spatial rift opened, and a group of spiritual insects of various shapes and sizes flew in from all directions.

The insects flew towards the rift, disappearing into the unknown.
High above the mountains, countless spiritual insects flew towards the fissure, but almost all of them were torn apart by spatial forces, leaving only a few dozen Golden Devouring Insects unscathed.

...

In the Gaochang Immortal Realm, the Miao Huang Sect.

A low-lying mountain range hidden in the midst of a thousand-mile poisonous swamp, the entire mountain belly was almost hollowed out, with a maze of tunnels and hundreds of palaces inside.

Countless people with ant heads and human bodies, all wearing black armor, were busy rushing through the maze.

At this moment, in the deepest part of the mountain belly, a massive underground palace, a gigantic white ant queen lay on the ground. Her lower body was plump and snowy white, resembling a silkworm, while her upper body was identical to a human, with a stunningly beautiful face.

Just then, a faint tremor shook the heavens, and the ant queen's eyes snapped open, filled with an incredulous and joyful expression.

"Could it be... impossible, no, it must be... it must be..."

She exclaimed in a disjointed tone, her body flashing with a soft glow, transforming into a human form, becoming a young woman in a white dress, with an aura of the late-stage Mahayana realm.

"Summon the people..."

Her voice rang out, and soon seven or eight people rushed in, kneeling down.

"We have been waiting for this day, the great army is gathering, and we will emerge in full force..."

The ant queen declared, her voice filled with excitement.

"We obey your orders."

The eight people responded in unison, their faces filled with joy and excitement.

On this day, the Gaochang Immortal Realm witnessed the largest insect tide in history.

However, these spiritual insects, which seemed to have been coordinated to rise up together, did not attack the cities, but instead gathered towards the highest peak in the realm, the Zhuyuan Peak.

Someone went to investigate and discovered that a massive spatial fissure had appeared above the peak, with a width of over 10,000 meters.

...

In the Beihan Immortal Realm.

A snowy and icy landscape in the far north of the Minghan Continent, where the land was frozen by the ancient ice, and even other living beings were scarce.

A lone ice mountain stood tall, its body a crystal blue, and in the midst of the snowstorm, a massive ice block broke off, revealing a gigantic cocoon.

The cocoon suddenly cracked open, releasing a burst of dark blue light, and a chill emanated from it, freezing the surrounding snowstorm.

A white-haired man with two long antennae on his forehead emerged from the cocoon, his face gaunt, with sharp features, and his eyes shone with a cold, blue light.

He wore a blue leather armor, and four blue wings fluttered behind him, his aura was that of the peak Mahayana realm.

"King, are you finally returning?"

He muttered to himself, gazing at the sky, and then vanished into the snowstorm.

...

In the Zhongtu Immortal Realm, the Tianyuan Continent, the Tian Court.

A giant palace made of jade-like green stone, a muscular man with a short haircut, a face like a golden Buddha, and eyes that seemed to bore into the soul, stood before a throne, his muscles rippling beneath his skin.

Several Tian Court officials stood before him, all of whom were Mahayana-level experts, but they bowed their heads, their faces filled with a mix of reverence and fear.

The reason was that this man, Xuan Yuan Jie, was a Five Elements Origin Ancestor, one of the seven rulers of the Tian Court.

"Is what you said true? Even Tong Qiu was assassinated?"

Xuan Yuan Jie grasped the throne, his voice cold and stern.

The officials knelt down, explaining that the Wheel of Reincarnation had sent out eight assassins, who had killed several powerful experts, including Tong Qiu, who was a friend of Xuan Yuan Jie's.

The officials trembled, not daring to speak further.
