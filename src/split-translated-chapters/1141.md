Near the small courtyard of the Miao Fa Xian Zun, a wine shop stood.

In a private room within the wine shop, a woman with red hair sat, none other than Chi Meng.

In front of her were arranged over a dozen wine jugs, more than half of which were empty.

"It seems that Miao Fa, that flat-chested woman, has already found Han Li's whereabouts." Chi Meng held a wine cup and gazed out the window of the private room, watching the distant blue light of Miao Fa Xian Zun, a smile playing on her lips.

"Chi Meng, your ingenious calculations, did you already guess that Liang Fa was a spy for the Jiu Yuan Guan, and that you were just playing along?" In the private room stood another person, the eagle-nosed man from the Golden Tower.

"I didn't know, but here in the Jin Yuan Xian Domain, this is the territory of the Jiu Yuan Guan, and no matter how we try to clean up our personnel, we will still be infiltrated by the Jiu Yuan Guan. It's pointless to waste our efforts, so let's just let things develop, and as long as we keep a close eye on Miao Fa, she will naturally find Han Li for us." Chi Meng drained the wine cup in her hand and spoke calmly.

"Your wisdom is profound, but won't this allow Miao Fa to take the initiative, and if she captures Han Li in a flash, won't that be disastrous?" The eagle-nosed man asked worriedly.

"You don't have to worry, Han Li has been able to evade the pursuit of the Heavenly Court for so long, and he even destroyed the body of Qi Mozi, so he is definitely not a simple character, and won't be caught so easily." Chi Meng smiled calmly.

"Yes." The eagle-nosed man nodded, still looking worried.

"Miao Fa has already left, let's follow her." Chi Meng raised her hand and waved it, a red light enveloped the two of them, and they chased after Miao Fa Xian Zun.

...

In the Jin Yuan Xian Domain, a green mountain range floated in the air, and a golden lightning array appeared, with two figures flashing into existence within it - Han Li and Lan Yan.

After leaving the Golden Spring City, they first used the Mo Long Fei Zhou to speed away for a distance, and then Han Li put away the Mo Long Fei Zhou and used the Wan Que Kong Ji technique to hide all of his spiritual energy, using only his Xian techniques to travel.

The spatial pressure of the Jin Yuan Xian Domain was much smaller than that of the Ji Lin Kong Jing, and Han Li's speed was extremely fast, not inferior to that of the escape light.

After that, Han Li used the Lei Guang Fa Zhen to transmit himself over a dozen times, and finally arrived at this place.

This place was already very far from the Golden Spring City, and Han Li had done his best to erase any traces that could be tracked, so he should be safe.

Han Li looked in the direction of the Golden Spring City, a thoughtful expression on his face.

The Heavenly Court's pursuit of him was so severe, and if he wanted to use the cross-domain transmission array to go to the Da Jin Yuan Xian Domain, it would be too reckless.

For now, it was better to follow Jiao San's advice and close up for a period of time to cultivate.

Han Li's cultivation had already reached the peak of the Tai Yi realm, and he had prepared everything for advancing to the Da Luo realm. It was time to make a breakthrough.

If he could advance to the Da Luo realm, his strength would undergo a qualitative leap, and his chances of rescuing Jin Tong from the Jiu Yuan Guan would increase greatly.

Han Li looked around, nodding to himself.

He had carefully studied the map of the Jin Yuan Xian Domain over the years, and this place should be in the northwest region of the Jin Yuan Shan, in the Qing Zhou Shan mountain range, which was remote and had no special spiritual materials or demonic beasts, and few people came here, making it a suitable place to close up and cultivate.

Han Li flew down and stopped at a secluded mountain peak, waving his hand.

A number of sword auras flew out, quickly digging a cave into the mountain wall, and then slightly carving it out, creating a cave dwelling.

He then set up layer upon layer of restrictions around the cave, covering the entire cave and the surrounding mountains, making it as secure as possible.

These restrictions all contained the power of various laws, and even if a Da Luo existence were to attack, they could resist for a while.

"Lan Daoist, I will be closing up here for a period of time, and you can rest here for a while as well." Han Li said to Lan Yan.

"Yes." Lan Yan hesitated for a moment, then nodded in agreement.

Han Li nodded, turned around, and entered the secret room.

Lan Yan looked at Han Li's back, stood silently for a moment, and then walked into a room and sat down.

Han Li entered the secret room, and with a wave of his hand, a layer of red restrictions appeared around the room, protecting it tightly.

He then raised his hand again, and a silver-white flame shot out from his sleeve, falling in front of him - it was the Jing Yan Tong Zi.

The Jing Yan Tong Zi's flames were still mostly silver, but some of them had begun to turn white, and the flame law fluctuations emanating from its body were much stronger than before.

Han Li's face showed a hint of joy.

The Jing Yan Huo Niao had been secretly refining the white fire bead over the years, and its strength had increased again.

"I will be closing up for a period of time, and I won't have time to take care of Lan Yan, so you keep an eye on her in secret. If she makes any suspicious moves, immediately take action and eliminate her." He said, his smile disappearing, and a cold glint appearing in his eyes.
Jingyan Tongzi nodded, and the Ah-ah-ah voice replied, transforming into a silver glow that entered the surrounding crimson seal.

Although Lanyan might not have any malicious intentions, his current progress in reaching the Great Luo Realm was too significant, and Han Li couldn't afford to be careless.

Unfortunately, Ti Hun was still in the Huazhi space, closed off and unable to refine the Wusuo Ghost King's power within his body. If he had her protection, Han Li would be even more at ease.

However, with Jingyan Tongzi watching over him, Han Li felt a sense of relief and focused his mind, closing his eyes and sitting still.

Time passed slowly, and half a day went by.

Han Li opened his eyes, having adjusted to the optimal state.

He flipped his hand, and a white incense burner appeared in front of him, with a silver incense stick the width of a finger and three inches long inserted into it.

After lighting it, a faint white smoke wafted out, resembling the morning mist in a mountain valley, exceptionally pure and carrying a subtle, intoxicating fragrance.

This was the Conghun incense, which was extremely beneficial for refining the spirit and increasing the chances of successfully advancing to the Great Luo Realm.

Han Li then took out three jade bottles and placed them beside him. One of the jade bottles contained a white pellet, which was the Xuanzhen pellet given to him by the Crab Daoist. This was the most crucial item for advancing to the Great Luo Realm.

The other two small bottles contained a golden spiritual liquid and three green pellets, respectively.

These items were all obtained through Han Li's tireless efforts and were treasures that aided in advancing to the Great Luo Realm.

Han Li first took the jade bottle containing the golden spiritual liquid, tilted his head, and dripped a few drops into his mouth.

Suddenly, a brilliant golden light burst forth from his body, and the time law within him began to churn like boiling water. The Zhenyan treasure wheel, the Duan time fire, the Guangyin pure vessel, the Dongyi divine wood, and the Huanchen hourglass all appeared, revolving rapidly around his body.

Han Li's eyes lit up, and he quickly took the jade bottle containing the green pellets, swallowed one, and closed his eyes to operate the "Great Five Elements Fantasy Technique".

As for the Xuanzhen pellet, he didn't rush to consume it, as it was necessary to wait until the crucial moment.

Han Li quickly closed his eyes, and the golden light on his body intensified, gradually enveloping his entire body.

A massive temporal energy churned within the secret room, causing the room to rumble and shake.

In another room within the cave, Lanyan suddenly opened his eyes, gazing towards Han Li's closed-off secret room, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes before he closed them again.

At this moment, in a certain location within the Jin Yuan mountain range, a blue glow appeared in the sky above a swamp.

A blue aura shot forth from the distance, stopping above the swamp, and the figures of the Miao Fa Xian Zun and two blue-clad maidens appeared.

"Saint Envoy, Han Li has escaped to this place, and the spiritual energy fluctuations have suddenly ceased," one of the blue-clad maidens said, holding a blue crystal basin that reflected the surrounding environment.

Within the basin, a faint green glow appeared, stretching from the distance to this location, but it suddenly vanished.

"It seems this person has hidden his aura, using another method to continue on his way," Miao Fa Xian Zun said, raising an eyebrow.

"The Mirror Water Basin can no longer detect his trail. Perhaps Saint Envoy, you will need to personally investigate from now on," the blue-clad maiden said.

Miao Fa Xian Zun waved her hand, and a blue glow burst forth from her mouth. Her hands formed a seal, and the blue light churned, producing a blue crystal thread that floated within it.

The thread then converged, forming a blue, vertical eye the size of a millstone, which gazed outwards.

A series of blue light waves flashed within the eye, appearing extremely mysterious.

Miao Fa Xian Zun's hands formed a seal, urging the blue eye to continue searching. At first, she was confident, but as time passed, her expression slowly darkened, revealing a hint of disbelief.

"How is this possible? Even if it were a Great Luo Realm cultivator at the same level as me, hiding their aura would be impossible. Han Li's concealment technique is surprisingly advanced, this is impossible!" Miao Fa Xian Zun muttered to herself, once again amplifying the blue eye's power and searching the surroundings.

In reality, Miao Fa Xian Zun had overestimated Han Li. If he continued to use his spiritual energy to advance, no matter how he hid his aura, he would still be detectable by Miao Fa Xian Zun's secret technique.

Han Li had merely employed the "Wan Qian Kong Ji" technique, hiding his spiritual energy within his body and remaining still, using only his physical strength to advance. Lanyan was directly placed within the Huazhi space, leaving no trail behind.

Miao Fa Xian Zun didn't consider that Han Li possessed such advanced techniques, and her search for spiritual energy fluctuations was naturally fruitless.

However, Miao Fa Xian Zun's Water Emperor's Divine Eye technique was indeed formidable. After searching for a while, she finally discovered some faint spiritual energy remnants within Han Li's body, such as the lingering energy of the Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword.

These remnants were extremely weak and intermittent, and even with Miao Fa Xian Zun's abilities, she could only follow these faint energy trails, slowly and painstakingly advancing.

A Chi Meng and the Eagle-Nosed Man followed from a distance, their faces filled with impatience at the slow pace. However, they didn't possess the skills to search for Han Li's trail, and could only rely on Miao Fa Xian Zun.
