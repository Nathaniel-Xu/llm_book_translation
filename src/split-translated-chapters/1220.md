Zhao Bolao was shocked by the sight, and his body suddenly retreated while his hand wielded a long gun that shone with white light, stirring up the air in front of him.

In front of him, a dense array of gun silhouettes appeared and disappeared in an instant, and the air was filled with a sudden snowstorm, the temperature dropping rapidly. A whirlpool of ice and snow formed, rushing towards Han Li like a tide, as if to engulf him.

Han Li, however, didn't slow down, his body charging forward with his arm wrapped in white light, shining brightly.

A loud "bang" echoed through the air!

The massive ice and snow whirlpool shattered, and Han Li's figure burst out of it.

The star power on his fist hadn't diminished much, and it struck Zhao Bolao's chest with a loud crash.

However, the expected dull thud and the sound of shattering bones didn't occur. Han Li felt as if he had punched a bundle of cotton, his fist passing through Zhao Bolao's chest.

The next moment, Zhao Bolao's chest burst open, revealing a large hole, and a large amount of water poured out.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and he tried to withdraw his arm, but the water in the hole immediately wrapped around his arm, exerting a powerful force that made it impossible for him to pull it out.

Suddenly, Zhao Bolao's body liquefied, turning into a transparent water person, his body soft and boneless, wrapping around Han Li's body like a layer of glue, immobilizing him.

At the same time, on the other side of the ice, a blue light flashed, and another Zhao Bolao appeared.

"Originally, I was fighting a domain spirit, which was quite unexpected," Han Li muttered.

Zhao Bolao said with a smile, "Sorry, fellow cultivator, you're out of the competition."

Zhao Bolao's hands moved swiftly, and the snowflakes on the ice surface erupted, shooting out countless dense snowflakes that flew towards Han Li like a storm.

The entire stage was engulfed in a frenzy of ice and snow, making it impossible to see anything.

On the ring-shaped stone platform, Zhou Xiangyang looked on in surprise, while Zhao Yuanlai had a smug expression on his face. The others were more focused on their own participants, while also paying attention to the competition between Shi Kongjian and his opponent.

Zhao Yuanlai said to Zhou Xiangyang, "It's a shame, but someone has to win or lose. This time, it's just the way it is."

Zhou Xiangyang, however, was puzzled, muttering to himself, "It shouldn't be like this... Does he only have this much power?"

Before he could finish speaking, a bright white light suddenly flashed on the "巳" stage, forming a massive whirlpool that exploded with a loud bang.

The ice domain that had been covering the stage shattered, and a massive amount of snow and ice flew out, sweeping towards the surroundings.

The people around felt the cold wind and snow, and the temperature dropped rapidly. Those with weaker cultivation were trembling with fear, their teeth chattering, and they hastily activated their cultivation techniques to protect themselves.

When the snow and ice dissipated, everyone looked at the "巳" stage, only to see Zhao Bolao lying unconscious on the ground, while Han Li stood beside him, his face pale, his lips blue, and his sleeves torn.

Zhou Xiangyang let out a sigh of relief, then turned to Zhao Yuanlai, who had a pale face, his previous triumphant expression gone.

Zhao Yuanlai's mouth twitched, and he didn't speak, only nodding his head.

The crowd was shocked by the sudden outcome on the "巳" stage, and the competition on the "午" stage had also reached its conclusion, with the opponent of Shi Kongjian being defeated, his body broken and thrown off the stage.

Shi Kongjian stood across from Han Li, his eyes filled with a challenging gaze.

Han Li, however, seemed to be in a state of disarray, but in reality, he was just pretending. He looked at Shi Kongjian, his eyes flashing with a cold light, which made Shi Kongjian's eyebrows furrow in surprise.

Not long after, the other stages also reached their conclusions, and new competitions began.

Han Li's competition for the day had ended, and he wouldn't be competing again until the next day. He didn't return to the ring-shaped stone platform but instead went back to his residence.

After returning to his dwelling, he immediately opened the Huazhi Cave Heaven and checked on the situation inside.

The Wailing Soul was still helping the Blue Yuanzi to nourish his soul, while Qu Lin seemed to be in a state of closed cultivation, adhering to his agreement with Han Li, not leaving the bamboo pavilion beside the spiritual medicine garden.

The next day, the second round of competitions began, and Han Li drew the name of Chu Zhong, the Palm Law Elder of the Wu Shang Sect.

As for Chu Zhong, the Xian Shan Sect had limited information about him, as he rarely left the Wu Shang Sect and mostly cultivated within its walls.

Han Li only knew that Chu Zhong cultivated the earth attribute law, and his cultivation was higher than Zhao Bolao's, being a early-stage Da Luo cultivator.
Han Li was the first to walk up to the "丑" (Ugly) character martial stage, while the Chu Zhong elder arrived slightly later and descended onto the stage.

Han Li's gaze swept across, and he saw that the elder had snow-white hair, a dark complexion, and a ordinary build, even slightly shorter than average. He wore a short-sleeved shirt with his sleeves rolled up, revealing a dark arm. At first glance, he seemed no different from a common martial artist from the lower realms.

However, Han Li noticed that the elder's eyes had a faint golden glow, and his posture was peculiar, with his back slightly hunched and his arms hanging in front of him. It was as if he was an old ape from the mountains, exuding a faint aura of decay.

Despite this, Han Li was impressed by the elder's inner strength and raised his opinion of him.

On the ring-shaped stone stage, Zhou Xianyang still sat in his original position, while Zhao Yuanqi, who had lost the opportunity to compete for the Bodhi command, sat beside him. Both of their expressions were calm, as if they didn't care about the events of the previous day.

"Zhou Sect Master, do you know this Chu Zhong elder?" Zhao Yuanqi asked, looking at the elder on the stage.

"Our Wujidao has no dealings with your Xianshan Sect, and this Chu Zhong elder is rarely seen outside. I've only heard of his name and don't know him personally," Zhou Xianyang replied.

"I had a encounter with him in the past, but it didn't go well. He's not an easy opponent," Zhao Yuanqi said with a smile. "In my opinion, among all the candidates for the selection, aside from Si Kongjian, he's the most difficult to deal with."

Zhou Xianyang heard this and smiled inwardly, realizing that Zhao Yuanqi was there to watch the commotion.

"Chang's luck is really bad. Yesterday, he barely won against your sect's Zhao Bolao, and today he's facing such a formidable opponent. It seems he'll have to be more serious," Zhou Xianyang said, his expression unchanged.

His words implied that Han Li hadn't been serious in his previous battle and had only won against Zhao Bolao by chance.

Zhao Yuanqi's face turned red with anger, but he couldn't express it. After a moment, he said, "Let's wait and see Chang's impressive performance."

In reality, after returning the previous day, he had asked Zhao Bolao why he had lost to Chang Qi. He had assumed that Chang Qi had hidden some trump card or used some underhanded tactic.

However, after asking, Zhao Bolao himself couldn't explain why he had lost, only saying that Chang Qi had suddenly burst out with a powerful force that exceeded his limits, and he had been knocked out with a single punch.

As they spoke, the battle on the stage had already begun.

Han Li bowed to Chu Zhong and didn't wait for the elder to make the first move. Instead, he took the initiative and struck, his arms vibrating with a loud crash. His body flashed behind the white-haired elder in an instant.

His fist shot out, and the tip of his fist exploded with a white light, accompanied by a thunderous sound.

Zhao Yuanqi, who had been watching the commotion, was also shocked by this sudden display of speed and power.

Chu Zhong seemed to be stunned by Han Li's sudden attack, and for a moment, he didn't move.

However, just as Han Li's fist was about to strike the elder's back, a dark light suddenly rose from the ground, and a black stone wall erupted from the ground, separating Han Li from the elder. At the same time, the stone wall struck Han Li's arm.

The timing was perfect, neither directly resisting Han Li's attack nor directly attacking him. Instead, the stone wall struck Han Li's armpit, achieving a two-for-one effect.

Han Li's fist missed, and he was struck by the stone wall, sending him flying into the air. Before he could stabilize himself, Chu Zhong's figure had already caught up, and he struck Han Li's back with a straightforward punch.

The fist was surrounded by a circle of black light, and as it hit Han Li's back, it exploded with a loud noise.

Han Li felt a sudden pressure on his back, as if the air had condensed into a solid mass. The force was so strong that it sent him crashing to the ground, causing the special martial stage to shudder violently.

Han Li's feet sank into the ground like steel knives, and the stone stage cracked open with a series of shocking fissures.

The ape-like Chu Zhong then rose high into the air, his body surrounded by an eerie black light. His legs were bent, and his entire body seemed to be pressed down by an invisible force.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he felt the pressure from above, as if the sky itself was pressing down on him. The air around him seemed to solidify, making it impossible for him to move or dodge.

"Drink!"

Han Li let out a loud roar, and his body's over 900 acupoints lit up simultaneously. He raised his arms, using the Great Power Golden Vajra technique to circulate the star power within his body. His palms formed a "supporting heaven" stance, and he raised them to meet the falling Chu Zhong.

The white light on his palms surged violently, as if opening a celestial curtain. The two forces collided, causing a massive explosion of black and white light.

The surrounding air was violently shaken, and a massive shockwave erupted, sweeping towards all directions.

The onlookers were shocked by this sudden explosion, and they turned to look at the "丑" character stage. However, only the black and white light remained, and the figures of the two combatants were obscured, making it impossible to see what was happening.
