……
"With their strength, nothing unexpected should happen inside, right?" Han Li guessed.

At this moment, a loud rumble echoed through the air near the Years Tower, and a large spatial rift appeared, spewing out three figures - Jiao San, Li Qi Ma, and Qu Lin.

The three looked a bit disheveled, clearly injured, especially Jiao San, who was half-covered in blood. Fortunately, none of them were in mortal danger.

"Brother Han, you're safe... We were worried about you when we lost you earlier, but it seems that was unnecessary," Jiao San said with a hint of joy, exhaling a sigh of relief.

"Thanks for your concern, Brother Jiao. I just managed to escape by luck. You should take a moment to rest; this place isn't safe for long," Han Li replied, nodding at Jiao San.

Li Qi Ma and Qu Lin, seeing Han Li unharmed, also relaxed and sat down, trying to stabilize their injuries.

……

At the Jin Yuan mountain range, in the Qing Si Valley.

It was late afternoon, and the ancient village hidden in the lush green mountains was bustling with people preparing their last meal of the day. Smoke drifted lazily from the chimneys of the low-roofed houses.

The village elder was sitting at a low table in front of his home with a few familiar old friends, sipping rough, homemade wine and waiting for his wife to bring out the dishes.

Suddenly, a loud "boom" shook the air!

The entire Qing Si Valley trembled violently, and the village elder's table shook, spilling wine from the cups.

"What's going on? Can't they just leave us alone?" the village elder complained, holding onto the wine jug and cups.

"These gods and immortals are always causing trouble, why can't they just leave us be?" a dark-skinned old man sitting across from him said.

"Uncle, I heard that a treasure appeared in the Qing Si Valley, and many gods and immortals came to fight over it. Later, many of them disappeared, and the remaining ones sealed off the area. Now, no one can get in," a middle-aged man said.

"I don't care what they're doing, as long as they don't ruin our spring water," the village elder said, worried.

As they spoke, another loud "boom" shook the air.

They had no idea that the brief moment of calm was their last.

……

Inside the White Head Valley, the rumbling sound grew louder, and the ground shook more frequently.

In the depths of the valley, two massive boulders shaped like the character "ren" were surrounded by cultivators from the Tong Tian Sword Sect, all wearing tense expressions and staring intently at the space below the boulders.

Suddenly, a ripple of light appeared in that space, and five or six figures emerged from it.

The people surrounding the boulders saw the figures' faces and immediately relaxed, bowing and greeting them:

"Welcome back, Elder..."

The figures who appeared were none other than Lei Yu Ce and the others.

Dao Yin's face was still pale, and his expression was anxious. Lei Yu Ce and the others also looked worried, and the waiting crowd immediately sensed that something was amiss.

"Chen Chuan, how's the task I assigned to you coming along?" Dao Yin asked, scanning the area.

"Reporting to the master, I followed your instructions and set everything up half a month ago. I've double-checked, and everything is in order," a tall, dark-bearded man replied, bowing.

"Give me the Dragon Tooth Key, and you can all leave," Dao Yin said, his brow furrowed.

Chen Chuan's brow furrowed slightly, but he didn't dare question the master's orders. He handed over a half-moon-shaped blood-red jade pendant, bowing.

"Master, you're too injured. Let us handle this," Lei Yu Ce said, his expression serious.

"Stone brother, must we really use this?" Chen Chuan asked, bowing to Lei Yu Ce.

"The demon-slaying plan failed, and the God's Lamp wasn't recovered. The Years Tower has been lost, and if we delay any further... the prisoners inside will break free, and the entire Jin Yuan Immortal Domain will face a disaster," Lei Yu Ce said gravely.

"Activating the Dragon Tooth Annihilation Array requires someone to catalyze it from within. Once the array is activated, it will explode in ten breaths, releasing most of its energy into the secret realm. However, the remaining energy will still destroy the surrounding mountains and rivers, and half of the Jin Yuan mountain range will be buried. With your current state, can you guarantee your safe escape?" Dao Yin asked, his brow furrowed.

"Don't underestimate me, Master. I still have the power to protect myself. You all should leave first," Lei Yu Ce said with a hint of a smile, his eyes falling on Su Xiao Qing.

"Dao Yin, is there really no other way? Our sects, the Tian Shui and Tong Tian, are both located in the Jin Yuan mountain range. If we do this, we'll be affected as well. What about the countless innocent lives in the surrounding areas? Must they suffer this disaster?" Su Xiao Qing asked, her brow furrowed.

The others, including Chen Chuan, fell silent, clearly sharing her concerns.
Dao Yin Zhenren's face showed a hint of hesitation, but he ultimately let out a soft sigh and said, "You don't know, we're in a difficult situation, we have no choice but to..."

"Let me explain," Lei Yu Ce took over, "The Dragon Tooth Annihilation Array is not set up by the Jin Yuan Xian Palace, but directly by the Heavenly Court. They demanded that we destroy the entire secret realm, to preserve the Jin Yuan Mountain Range, we took the risk of entering the secret realm, wanting to kill the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor and retrieve the Years of Life Lamp."

Su Xiao Qing's expression changed slightly, she also understood the weight of an order from the Heavenly Court.

"Originally, if the plan succeeded, we could have used the Years of Life Lamp to suppress the demons in the Years of Life Tower one by one, but unfortunately, it failed, now we have to use the Dragon Tooth Annihilation Array," Lei Yu Ce continued.

"If the demons in the tower escape, the Heavenly Court will definitely intervene, it won't be just a simple matter of killing demons, our Tong Tian Sword Sect will be in danger, the Tian Shui Sect will also be held accountable. In this situation, some sacrifices are unavoidable," Dao Yin Zhenren sighed and said.

Just as he finished speaking, a loud rumbling sound echoed through the valley, the ground shook even more violently than before.

"Bad, the Years of Life Tower is about to collapse, we must act immediately, we can't delay," Dao Yin Zhenren's expression changed, he said.

"Please, Master, take everyone and leave, I'll take care of activating the array," Lei Yu Ce said, clasping his fists.

"Alright, this matter is entrusted to you, you must return safely," Dao Yin Zhenren said, seeing Lei Yu Ce's determined expression, he no longer hesitated.

He handed the half-moon shaped jade pendant to Lei Yu Ce, who took it and felt the warm, complex patterns on it, his eyes lit up slightly as he nodded heavily.

"Take care," Su Xiao Qing said, turning to look at Lei Yu Ce as they parted ways.

Lei Yu Ce smiled and nodded.

Then, Dao Yin Zhenren led the others out of the White Head Valley, flying away quickly.

Su Xiao Qing glanced at the small village in the distance, surrounded by smoke and twilight, and sighed softly.

After the others left, Lei Yu Ce flew up, hovering in the air, his hands clasped together, holding the Dragon Tooth Key, his mouth chanting incantations.

As he chanted, the entire White Head Valley began to shake, thick, half-arc shaped stone pillars burst out of the ground and mountain walls, extending outward.

In a short while, the entire valley was filled with hundreds of black stone pillars, each one engraved with dense, ancient symbols, emitting a dark red glow, containing a fierce, burning energy and a suppressed, fluctuating spiritual energy.

Lei Yu Ce held the jade pendant, feeling the energy emanating from the surroundings, and couldn't help but feel a bit dry-mouthed.

But time was pressing, he couldn't hesitate, he gritted his teeth, and with a changed hand seal, he threw the Dragon Tooth Key out.

The key flew up, its blood-red light flashing, like a crescent moon hanging in the air.

The crescent moon flashed with light, and the symbols on the stone pillars below began to flash in sync.

"Open!" Lei Yu Ce chanted, his hands parting, and he shouted.

The crescent moon suddenly burst into a brilliant light, shattering into countless blood-red crystals that scattered toward the stone pillars.

The crystals landed on the pillars, and the symbols on them began to glow.

"Ten breaths, nine breaths, eight breaths..."

Lei Yu Ce counted his breaths, his body shooting out like a bullet, fleeing the valley.

A flash of light followed, and Xiong Shan appeared, riding the golden sword, his speed almost matching Lei Yu Ce's.

"Four breaths, three breaths..."

"One breath..."

"BOOM!"

A deafening explosion shook the sky, and the White Head Valley was bathed in a sea of red light, countless wolf-tooth shaped light pillars burst out of the ground, the earth shook, and the surrounding mountains trembled.

The village of Yu Liang was instantly annihilated, its residents torn apart by the gale, their buildings and homes reduced to dust.

Almost half of the Jin Yuan Mountain Range was ravaged, the cities and towns built upon it were destroyed, the sects and monasteries were reduced to rubble, and countless lives were lost.
