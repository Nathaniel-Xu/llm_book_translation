Han Li unleashed his powerful Five Elemental Annihilation Fist, striking the golden wall condensed by Xuan Yuan Jie's palm with incredible force, causing it to explode instantly.

A deafening boom shook the air!

The massive fist shadows shattered, transforming into a series of powerful shockwaves that radiated outward in all directions.

The golden wall trembled, cracking open with numerous large fissures, but it didn't immediately collapse. Instead, a powerful counterattack force was generated, shooting back towards Han Li.

Han Li, having just finished using his Five Elemental Annihilation Fist, was unable to dodge the attack and was knocked flying backward.

Behind the wall, Xuan Yuan Jie was also struggling, his body frozen in place by the temporal law fluctuations unleashed by Han Li's fist. He was unable to move for a long time.

Just then, a sudden change occurred.

The seventy-two Qingtong Huixing swords, which had somehow moved to the rear, transformed into seventy-two jade-like, intricately carved children, each flying through the air without the need for control.

The sword spirits flew to the sword array's position, their bodies radiating golden light as they transformed back into massive flying swords, hovering in mid-air.

A low rumbling sound echoed through the air, accompanied by the appearance of a majestic, ten-thousand-meter-tall Heavenly Gate within the dark, boundless space.

The gate was surrounded by countless golden clouds, churning and boiling with an aura of majesty.

Although the gate remained closed, the sounds of thunderous rumbling and the intense, electric law fluctuations emanating from within were unmistakable.

"How is this possible? He's cultivating the power of temporal laws, yet his sword array contains such powerful electric law fluctuations?" Yin Wu Shuang exclaimed, shocked, as he fought against Frost White.

He had no idea that Han Li's seventy-two Qingtong Huixing swords had undergone the same rigorous training as Han Li himself, absorbing the law fluctuations from the Lei Kui's Eye, making them comparable to third-grade divine artifacts.

The combined power of seventy-two such swords was equivalent to the combined strength of seventy-two Da Luo realm cultivators, making their might unimaginable.

Han Li and the sword array were separated by a great distance, but their minds were connected.

As soon as a thought arose in Han Li's mind, the Heavenly Gate emitted a low rumbling sound and slowly opened.

Within the gate, a vast expanse of golden light was visible, with countless lightning waterfalls cascading down from above, accompanied by thousands of lightning dragons surging upward, each carrying a lightning pearl in their mouths, rushing towards the gate.

The sound of thunderous rumbling grew louder, and the space around the gate began to distort, creating numerous spatial rifts.

"Let's try this again, shall we?" Han Li suddenly stood up, his hands grasping downward.

The restrictive force within the gate disappeared, and the countless lightning dragons, now unbound, wildly surged out of the gate, charging towards Xuan Yuan Jie.

The entire domain was engulfed in a massive, electrifying storm, with the sound of thunderous rumbling growing louder.

"Protect the Bug Ancestor!" Qing Feng shouted.

Ants and Frost White flew backward, abandoning their fight against Yin Wu Shuang and the others, and positioned themselves in front of the Golden Child.

The golden whirlwind surrounding the Golden Child had disappeared, and the spatial rifts around her no longer had any Devouring Gold Insects flying into them. It was clear that all the Devouring Gold Insects scattered throughout the heavenly realm had returned to her body.

However, for some reason, her aura continued to expand, yet she was unable to break through the final barrier and restore her true form as the Devouring Law's Ancestor.

Yin Wu Shuang and the others, witnessing this, did not dare to continue fighting and retreated to a safe distance, avoiding the electrifying storm.

The Heavenly Court cultivators, still able to move, fled in all directions, while those who couldn't escape were quickly engulfed by the storm.

The sound of crackling electricity filled the air, and the entire space had transformed into a sea of lightning.

Thousands of lightning dragons swam through the space, surging towards Xuan Yuan Jie, each carrying a lightning pearl filled with the purest lightning essence.

"If I don't kill you today, you'll become a calamity no less than the Wheel of Reincarnation's master," Xuan Yuan Jie declared, his eyes flashing with a fierce light.

With a loud shout, he joined his hands together, forming a complex hand seal, and began to chant an incantation.
Suddenly, a chant-like sound, similar to the ancient Buddhist chanting, floated in from an unknown location in the void, resonating with Xuan Yuan Jie's voice, and gradually reverberating like the Huang Zhong Da Lu.

The space within a hundred million miles seemed to freeze for a moment, and a deafening explosion suddenly swept through, echoing throughout the void.

Han Li's face changed, and his body was enveloped in a golden glow as he flew up into the air.

The floating continent beneath him exploded in a series of thunderous roars, and all the mountains, stones, and earth were reduced to flying ash. Only the earth attribute law contained within was condensed into a single entity, transforming into a yellow river of light.

Xuan Yuan Jie swung his fist, and the entire yellow river was drawn towards the massive storm of lightning.

A deafening boom shook the void!

The deep, dark void was suddenly illuminated, and countless lightning dragons burst forth, creating massive whirlpools that wildly swirled in all directions.

In the sky, whirlpools of purple, green, gold, and silver lightning churned the river, which contained the most refined earth attribute law, into a chaotic mess. Tens of thousands of feet long lightning whips lashed out in all directions, destroying the surrounding void.

The remaining Heavenly Court cultivators could no longer care about anything else and fled towards the void rifts leading to various immortal realms.

The aftermath of this attack was too powerful, and the void around Jin Tong's location was constantly shattering. Ants, Xuan, and three others combined their strength to support a spherical light screen, barely holding back the force, but it was on the verge of shattering.

Han Li pinched his sword fingers, activating the sword array's lightning evasion technique. A golden electric light flashed around him, and his figure vanished from his original location, reappearing beside a Qingtian Huanyun sword.

He swung his hands upwards, and the time law fluctuated around him. The True Word Bead, the Time Cleansing Vessel, the Illusory Hourglass, the Dongyi Divine Tree, and the Time Severing Torch flew out, each returning to its respective position.

In the void above, a golden moon and a vast array of crimson stars suddenly appeared, and the landscape below transformed into a world of mountains, rivers, and forests, as if transported to another realm.

As the Five Elements Illusory Realm enveloped the surrounding space, Ants, Xuan, and the others felt the pressure around them ease, but they dared not relax, continuing to support the light screen and protect Jin Tong.

"Ha! You've successfully enraged me, Han Li. Today, you shall see the true power of a Dao Ancestor!" Xuan Yuan Jie's voice boomed from the distance, rolling like thunder, unceasing.

"I await your demonstration," Han Li replied with a calm smile.

Ants gazed at Han Li from afar, seeing a hint of a smile on his face, and his respect for Han Li reached new heights.

In his eyes, Han Li's bravery in facing a Dao Ancestor with his Great Luo Realm cultivation was unimaginable. After all, the gap between each small realm within the Great Luo Realm was like a chasm, and the difference between a Great Luo Realm cultivator and a Dao Ancestor was like the difference between a firefly's glow and the radiance of the full moon.

Moreover, Xuan Yuan Jie was the one who had struck the Insect Ancestor, forcing it to transform into countless bodies to escape with its life.

Years had passed since then, and Xuan Yuan Jie's power had far surpassed his imagination.

"Indeed, there are people in this world who can remain calm in the face of danger, and even smile...," Ants thought, though he believed Han Li would surely die.

However, Han Li's palms were actually drenched in sweat at this moment.

He remained calm only to further enrage Xuan Yuan Jie, for he believed that only by provoking him could he truly defeat him.

But what Han Li hoped for even more was that Jin Tong would immediately ascend to the position of a Dao Ancestor.

The aftermath of the lightning storm and the yellow river's collision finally subsided, but the void rifts in the surrounding space persisted, refusing to disappear.

Xuan Yuan Jie strode forward, his footsteps causing the void to shudder, and a golden glow radiated from his body. The air was filled with an earsplitting boom.

Han Li's gaze locked onto Xuan Yuan Jie, his expression changing.

He noticed that Xuan Yuan Jie's eyes were devoid of any emotional color, and his pupils seemed empty, with two ancient, mysterious symbols hidden within.

Around him, layers of void fluctuations, invisible to the naked eye, rippled out with each step, spreading into the depths of the void, beyond Han Li's line of sight.

Han Li understood that these fluctuations contained the true essence of the earth, which had been hidden since the dawn of time.

In that moment, Xuan Yuan Jie seemed to be one with the earth and the heavens.

Suddenly, Xuan Yuan Jie stopped, and his lips opened, uttering two words that shook the void:

"Di mie." (Earth Extinguished)

The atmosphere in the void changed, and a powerful force of attraction gathered from all directions, pouring into Xuan Yuan Jie's body.

Xuan Yuan Jie's arms spread wide, and a golden light enveloped him, his aura no longer containing any human essence, resembling a primordial deity.

"The time has finally come..." Han Li said, his voice filled with excitement.
