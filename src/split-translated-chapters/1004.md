A moment later, the white-robed man, referred to as "Gongzhu" by Tao Ji, appeared in a grand hall deep within the Jin Yuan Xian Palace.

Inside the hall, a golden disc about the size of a foot floated in mid-air, radiating a bright golden light and forming a complex transmission array.

He took out a purple token, one side of which was engraved with the three golden characters "Jiuyuan Guan", while the other side featured a majestic landscape of mountains and rivers.

The white-robed man was about to place the token into the transmission array, but his gaze flickered and he stopped.

He hesitated for a moment, then put the token away and turned to enter another grand hall.

"Come forth!" the white-robed man sat down on the main seat, his voice booming.

As soon as he spoke, two figures appeared out of thin air in front of him.

One was an old man with gray hair, small eyes that darted back and forth, a nose that was nearly twice as long as normal, and two wispy yellow mustaches. He looked like a giant, intelligent mouse.

The other was a burly man wearing a black robe, his arms crossed, with a black ghost-head battle knife on his back. His face was cold and expressionless.

"Gongzhu, what are your orders?" the two men bowed and spoke in unison.

The old man's voice was shrill, like the cry of a mouse in the fields, while the black-robed man's voice was rough and hoarse, like the sound of steel needles piercing the ear.

"Ly Yun, go to the North Han Xian Domain and investigate that Han Li. Start from the time he ascended to the True Immortal Realm and don't miss any details," the white-robed man ordered.

"Yes," the old man nodded.

"Hei Dao, go to the Tian Song Guan and track down Han Li's trail. Find him, but don't alert him," the white-robed man continued to order the black-robed man.

"Yes!" the black-robed man nodded.

"Go!" the white-robed man waved his hand, and the two men disappeared in an instant.

The white-robed man closed his eyes, leaning back in his chair, a faint smile on his lips.

At this moment, Han Li was riding a sky-blue flying car, which had transformed into a blue streak of light as it flew forward.

This flying car was found in the storage device of the Zhuo Gu True Person, and its quality was not inferior to his previous blue jade flying car.

He sat cross-legged in the flying car, controlling its movement while simultaneously waving his hand to release over a hundred storage devices from his sleeve. These were the storage devices he had obtained from Tao Ji and the others.

Han Li took out Tao Ji's storage device, his divine sense entering it, and after a moment, a golden light flashed, and a golden token appeared. One side of the token was engraved with a dragon pattern, while the other side had the words "Tao Ji" written on it. The bottom of the token had the words "Jin Yuan Xian Palace" written in small characters.

He looked at the token, his brow furrowed.

He had been entangled in a web of debts with the Heavenly Court for many years, and he was quite familiar with the various Xian Palaces. He also knew a great deal about the identity tokens used by the Xian Palaces.

This identity token was a long-standing token of the Jin Yuan Xian Palace.

He put the token away and examined the storage device of the other person, Jing Chuan, and quickly determined his identity. Jing Chuan was a elder of the Tian Shui Sect, a large sect in the Jin Yuan Xian Domain.

As for the other Golden Immortals, half of them were from the Jin Yuan Xian Palace, while the other half were from the Tian Shui Sect.

These people's cultivation was not low, and they held a certain status within the Xian Palaces and sects. However, to Han Li, the items in their storage devices, aside from the numerous immortal stones, were not very impressive.

He simply divided the items into several categories, planning to exchange them for immortal stones in the future. The number of immortal stones he had obtained would be enough for a Taiyi Realm cultivator to cultivate in seclusion for at least a million years.

Han Li was organizing his spoils, a contemplative look on his face.

The Tian Shui Sect was not a concern for now, but the Jin Yuan Xian Domain was one of the Heavenly Court's top domains, and its ruler was at least a Da Luo Realm cultivator. This was far beyond the North Han Xian Domain where he had first arrived in the True Immortal Realm.

He had killed one of their elders and many Golden Immortals, and although there were no survivors, he didn't know what methods they might use to find him.

But as the saying went, "many debts don't weigh on the body." The Heavenly Court had killed him before, and since his identity had already been exposed, they would not spare him. So, he might as well kill one more, or a pair, and see how it went.

His current cultivation and physical strength were far beyond what they had been when he first arrived in the True Immortal Realm. Even if a Da Luo Realm cultivator came, he was confident he could escape.

However, the Jin Yuan Xian Palace was backed by the Heavenly Court, an enormous organization that included the existence of the Dao Ancestor. Although he had caused a stir before, it was unlikely to have attracted the attention of the Dao Ancestor. But now, it was uncertain.

He was quite confident in his abilities, but he was not arrogant enough to think he could oppose the entire Heavenly Court.

It seemed that for now, he had no choice but to hide his tracks.

Han Li took out several thick books and flipped through them quickly.

These books were from the storage devices of Tao Ji and the others, and they contained information about the Jin Yuan Xian Domain.

The books were detailed records of the domain's geography, human geography, and other information.
Han Li's mind was preoccupied with multiple things, and he was simultaneously flipping through several books. With his current memory abilities, he finished reading them in an instant.

His eyes flashed momentarily, and then he pinched a seal.

The flying car's blue light flashed, and it immediately changed direction, speeding forward.

More than a decade passed in the blink of an eye.

In a certain location within the Golden Source Immortal Domain, a blue streak of light flashed across the sky, coming to a gentle stop. A blue flying car appeared.

In front of the flying car was a massive, golden mountain range, with peaks that reached into the clouds. The mountain range stretched out to the sides, extending to the limits of one's vision, resembling a gigantic, golden heavenly moat that stretched across the horizon.

The golden mountain range was surrounded by a dense, golden mist that made the peaks within seem to appear and disappear, giving off an air of mystery.

"We've finally arrived," Han Li said, standing on the flying car and gazing out at the mountain range with a relaxed expression.

Standing beside Han Li was a black-robed girl, none other than the recently awakened Qiuhun.

Her complexion still looked somewhat pale, and her beautiful eyes flashed with a hint of surprise as she gazed out at the massive mountain range.

This mountain range was known as the Golden Source Mountain Range, the most renowned mountain range in the Golden Source Immortal Domain. Unlike the complex geography of the Northern Frost Immortal Domain, the Golden Source Immortal Domain was comprised of a single, massive continent, with the Golden Source Mountain Range stretching from west to east, covering nearly half of the continent.

In terms of area, the Golden Source Mountain Range was the largest Han Li had ever seen.

The Golden Source Mountain Range was not only vast but also a place where wealth and danger coexisted.

This immortal domain was named the Golden Source Immortal Domain, and as the name suggested, the golden attribute spiritual energy was extremely dense. The Golden Source Mountain Range was the gathering place of the golden attribute spiritual veins throughout the entire immortal domain.

The golden attribute spiritual energy within the mountain range was incredibly dense, giving birth to countless golden attribute spiritual materials. Almost every cultivator in the Golden Source Immortal Domain would come to explore and search for treasure.

However, the Golden Source Mountain Range's golden attribute spiritual energy was too dense, causing the formation of numerous natural golden force fields within the mountain range. The deeper one went into the mountain range, the stronger the golden force fields became, greatly affecting the strength of ordinary cultivators.

Moreover, the Golden Source Mountain Range's golden attribute spiritual energy was too abundant, giving birth to many peculiar metal beasts. These strange creatures were formed from the golden attribute spiritual energy and possessed great strength. Since they were born in this place, they were not affected by the golden force fields, and they would often engage in fierce battles with cultivators.

The golden force fields, metal beasts, and other dangers within the mountain range resulted in countless cultivators losing their lives each year.

However, the allure of wealth and treasure was too great, and many cultivators continued to flock to the Golden Source Mountain Range, seeking to claim its riches.

The Golden Source Mountain Range was a natural treasure trove, and the Golden Source Immortal Palace would not ignore it. In fact, the Golden Source Immortal Palace was located at the western end of the Golden Source Mountain Range and had been trying to bring the entire mountain range under its control.

Unfortunately, the mountain range was too vast, and the Golden Source Immortal Palace could only control a small portion of the western region. The remaining area was controlled by numerous sects and noble families.

These regions were not unified under a single authority, and the various powers vied for their own interests, resulting in a chaotic situation.

Han Li had come to the Golden Source Mountain Range precisely because of this chaotic environment.

He had currently opened up over nine hundred acupoints, and based on his past experiences, he believed that continuing to open up his immortal acupoints would be much easier.

He now possessed a large quantity of immortal stones and planned to spend some time in secluded cultivation, aiming to rapidly improve his cultivation level.

Regardless of the circumstances, the sudden attack by Tao Ji and the others had instilled a sense of urgency within him.

He had an idea, and he once again activated the Wheel of Reincarnation mask, changing his appearance to that of a black-faced, black-bearded man. His cultivation level was suppressed to that of a Golden Immortal at the initial stage.

"Master, should I also use the Wheel of Reincarnation mask to change my appearance?" Qiuhun asked, seeing Han Li's actions.

"There's no need to bother, as no one recognizes you here," Han Li replied, shaking his head. He then activated the flying car, and it continued forward, soon entering the Golden Source Mountain Range.

As they drew closer, the Golden Source Mountain Range appeared even more majestic, and a massive, oppressive feeling washed over them, shaking their hearts.

Compared to the massive mountain range, Han Li and Qiuhun seemed like insignificant ants.

The spiritual energy in this place was extremely dense, with the majority being golden attribute spiritual energy. Other attributes were scarce.

This unique environment was ideal for cultivators who practiced golden attribute cultivation techniques, but it was unfavorable for others.

However, this environment did not affect Han Li, as he relied on medicinal pills for his cultivation rather than external spiritual energy.

"Master, where will we go next? Will we find a place to cultivate within the mountain range?" Qiuhun asked, looking around.

"There are many sects that have established cities within the Golden Source Mountain Range. Let's take a look and see if the outside is stable. If it is, we can cultivate there," Han Li replied after a brief moment of consideration.

"Alright!" Qiuhun nodded in agreement.
