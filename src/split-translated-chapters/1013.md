Qí Mò Zǐ ignored the Flame Person's words and thought for a moment before reaching into the fire pit and casually grabbing a handful of flames. The Flame Person was pulled out along with a ball of fire, and as it left the fire pit, its body began to take shape.

It transformed into a large, fiery humanoid with a wide body and limbs, and its appearance was identical to Qí Mò Zǐ's. As Qí Mò Zǐ's palm glowed with flames, the Flame Person's aura suddenly surged, matching Qí Mò Zǐ's own aura.

"I'll take care of this myself, you stay and guard the Xian Prison," Qí Mò Zǐ said, retracting his hand.

The Flame Person, who had been about to speak, was interrupted by Qí Mò Zǐ: "This is the Xian Prison, no one will dare to speak out of turn. I'll only bring one person with me, and we'll return quickly."

"You're not even bringing me, who are you bringing?" the Flame Person asked, puzzled.

"Someone he knows," Qí Mò Zǐ replied with a faint smile.

With that, he strode out of the temple, his aura suddenly concealed, and a burst of flames enveloped his body. He transformed into a ball of fire and flew off towards a distant, golden-colored space adjacent to the Blood Cloud.

...

Sixty years passed in the blink of an eye.

In the Qing Huo City, a quiet courtyard outside a secluded mansion had a clean, winding path made of bluestone. The morning sun cast dappled shadows on the path, creating a serene atmosphere.

A group of children, holding colorful paper windmills, ran back and forth on the path, laughing and playing. The sound of their laughter carried over the low wall and into the adjacent courtyard.

In the courtyard, a young girl in black clothes sat on a stone bench, listening to the children's laughter. She was none other than Tí Hún.

Since she had gained the ability to see into people's hearts, she had grown fond of listening to children's laughter, which was filled with pure and joyful emotions.

As she smiled to herself, she suddenly turned her head to look behind her.

Han Li, wearing a new, sky-blue robe, walked out of the main hall with a smile on his face.

"Master, you're out of seclusion so quickly, have you broken through?" Tí Hún asked, raising an eyebrow.

"It wasn't too difficult. With the various mystical techniques open to me, cultivating the Great Five Elements Illusory Realm Technique has become much easier. It only took a little over a hundred years, which is within my expectations," Han Li replied with a smile.

He didn't mention that he could have broken through to the Tai Yi late-stage realm if he had continued to cultivate.

"Congratulations, Master!" Tí Hún said, her face lighting up with joy.

"Thank you for guarding the law for me during this time... Has anything unusual happened in the Qing Huo tribe?" Han Li asked, continuing.

"Nothing out of the ordinary," Tí Hún replied. "The tribe's leader has fully recovered from his injuries, and the tribe's morale has greatly improved. It's as if they've gained a commander, and their spirits have been lifted. The Jin Ma Sect hasn't dared to cause any more trouble, and everything has calmed down. I was worried that Master's breakthrough would attract attention, but I didn't even notice anything."

"This breakthrough was relatively easy, and I didn't encounter any major obstacles. Besides, I was cultivating in the Flower Branch Cave Heaven, which was sealed with a powerful array to conceal my aura. That's why there was no commotion. However, when I break through to the Tai Yi late-stage realm, I won't be able to stay in the Flower Branch Cave Heaven, and the disturbance will be much greater. I'll need to find a new place to cultivate," Han Li explained.

Han Li and Tí Hún were chatting and laughing when, in the Qing Huo tribe's council hall, a heated discussion was underway.

"Tribe leader, when that person came to our tribe, I felt that he was suspicious. Now, with this news from the Xian Palace, he's probably the one who's been slaughtering ordinary people to cultivate dark magic. We can't let someone like that stay in our tribe!" Qiú Zhǎnglǎo said, his face filled with anxiety.

"Yes, Qiú Zhǎnglǎo is right. We can't trust the human tribe, and we must be cautious. What if he's indeed the one on the wanted list?" another elder said, nodding in agreement.

Several others in the room nodded in agreement, their faces grave with concern.

"I don't think there's been a misunderstanding," Yè Sùsù said, her face red with anger. "Han Li's aura is calm and composed, not at all like that of a dark cultivator. He wouldn't be the one on the wanted list. Besides, he saved me and my mother, so he can't be that kind of person."

The Qing Huo tribe's elders looked at each other, unsure of what to do.
"If the people of the Immortal Palace were to investigate here, our Qing Huo tribe would be unable to bear the consequences, and even the entire Qing Huo City might be destroyed in an instant." Another elder sighed and said.

"Yes, it can't be like this..."

"It can't be that we would put the lives of the entire tribe at risk because of an outsider..."

"Tribe leader, think carefully!"

The great hall was filled with murmurs and sighs.

"Uncle and elder uncles, Han Li has done us a great favor, and we, the Qing Huo tribe, can't be ungrateful and repay kindness with enmity, can we?" Ye Su Su exclaimed loudly, seeing that most of the people were in agreement.

After her outburst, the great hall finally quieted down, and everyone's face showed a hint of guilt.

"I understand what you all mean," a gentle voice suddenly spoke up.

Everyone turned to look at the dignified woman sitting on the large chair, Ye Luo, the tribe leader of the Qing Huo tribe.

"No matter what the Immortal Palace's wanted poster says, Han Li has done us a great favor, and we can't repay kindness with enmity," Ye Luo said calmly.

"Mother, you are wise..." Ye Su Su nodded repeatedly.

"But, Han Li has been targeted by the Immortal Palace, and we can't continue to keep him in our tribe, or it would be a disaster for both us and him," Ye Luo said, interrupting Ye Su Su.

Ye Su Su's face fell upon hearing this.

Although she was grateful to Han Li for his help, she knew that her mother was right, and she had been unwilling to admit it earlier. Now that her mother had spoken, she could only remain silent.

The others nodded in agreement, and some even let out a sigh of relief.

"Su Su, Han Li was brought to our tribe by you, and this matter can only be discussed with him by you," Ye Luo said, looking at her daughter.

Ye Su Su opened her mouth to speak, but ultimately said nothing, nodding silently.

"This person's identity is unknown, and I don't want the young master to go and negotiate with him personally. I'll go and talk to him instead," Qi Long said, his face sinking.

"Qi Long, Han Li is our tribe's benefactor, and he has a connection with Su Su. Since the matter started with her, it should be ended by her," Ye Luo said, shaking her head.

"Qi Long, don't worry, I'll go and settle this matter," Ye Su Su said, bowing.

"This... fine, I'll go with you," Qi Long said, sighing.

About half an hour later, two figures appeared, and they landed outside the small courtyard. The children on the small path outside the courtyard called out, "Sister, sister," and gathered around.

Ye Su Su didn't have time to play with them today, so she let them go and play on their own, while she and Qi Long went to the small courtyard door and knocked.

The sound of the knock was followed by a gentle male voice: "Please come in."

Ye Su Su and Qi Long pushed open the door and saw Han Li sitting at the stone table in the courtyard, holding a cup of tea and smiling at them.

"Han Li..."

Ye Su Su greeted Han Li, but then remembered the purpose of her visit and felt a pang of guilt, lowering her head.

Qi Long stepped forward, placing himself in front of Ye Su Su, his eyes scanning the surroundings before landing on Han Li with a cautious expression.

"Since it's Ye Su Su and Qi Long who have come together, I suppose it's not a private matter, and it's related to me, right? Please speak freely," Han Li said, ignoring Qi Long's caution.

Qi Long's eyes sank, and he was about to speak when Ye Su Su raised her hand to stop him.

"Han Li, please forgive me for being abrupt. The matter is this..." Ye Su Su stepped forward and explained the situation with the Immortal Palace's wanted poster, but didn't mention the part about him leaving the Qing Huo City.

Han Li listened seriously, and after Ye Su Su finished, he couldn't help but laugh and say, "The Immortal Palace is being so secretive, and they're even fabricating a false charge against me?"

Ci Hun also smiled silently.

"I knew it, Han Li wouldn't be a cruel person," Ye Su Su said, her face relaxing into a smile.

Han Li's expression turned serious, and he said, "The Immortal Palace is being too cunning, and they're even using such a false charge against me."
