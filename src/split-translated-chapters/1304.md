"You've monopolized the Six Paths of Reincarnation for far too long, it's time for a change in ownership! Since I've arrived, I've already made all the necessary preparations!" Bone Emperor sneered, saying.

As soon as his words fell, his two bone arms stretched out to the sides, then rotated upwards and downwards, his five fingers forming a strange hand seal.

His eyes suddenly blazed with intense soul fire, like two raging flames, and his aura surged upwards, his entire body becoming even whiter and more translucent. However, his bones began to show fine cracks on the surface.

Behind him, a massive white bone spirit domain emerged, expanding rapidly in all directions before disappearing into the distance.

In an instant, the surrounding area of hundreds of millions of miles was covered by this spirit domain, which continued to expand.

This spirit domain was enormous, directly enveloping the Black River, Earthly Demons, and Yanluo realms, and it was still expanding rapidly, as if it would soon cover the entire Underworld.

The sky tore apart, and bone-shaped lights emerged, radiating an immense force of law, as if the Heavenly Dao had descended.

As the white bone spirit domain passed through, all ghostly creatures with higher cultivation realms could resist it to some extent, while those with lower cultivation realms were instantly torn apart, their bones flying out and merging into the spirit domain.

Furthermore, the white bone spirit domain seeped into the void, covering the lower realms.

In those realms, it was as if a catastrophe had struck!

In an instant, countless living beings exploded, dying instantly, their bones flying out and forming massive rivers of white bones that merged into a vortex in the air.

Innumerable bones converged from all directions, merging into the white bone spirit domain that Bone Emperor had created, forming a massive mountain peak that radiated boundless white light.

Clearly, Bone Emperor had finally revealed his true power as the Dao Ancestor!

Inside the Reincarnation Array, Zi Ling's eyes turned black, and she fainted, but was caught by Han Li.

Shi Chuan Kong's face turned pale, and he sat down on the ground with a thud.

Jin Tong's situation was slightly better, but his face was covered in cold sweat, and his body swayed unsteadily.

Han Li's mind was shaken, and he felt a wave of dizziness. He hastily activated his time law and Lian Shen technique to stabilize his mind.

He felt a shiver run down his spine as he realized that the Dao Ancestor's full power was truly terrifying.

However, the Reincarnation Palace Master smiled slightly and raised his hand.

A massive, six-pointed wheel of reincarnation appeared in front of him, its surface radiating a kaleidoscope of colors.

From within the wheel, countless figures emerged, each with a unique shape and appearance, but they only flashed by for an instant, leaving behind an indescribable sense of vastness.

This wheel seemed to be under the Palace Master's control, as if everything within it moved according to his will.

It was as if he had grasped the cycles of life and death across countless realms.

All living beings, be they human, demon, or ghost, were under his control, unable to escape the wheel of reincarnation.

The six-pointed wheel rotated slowly, and the massive mountain of white bones suddenly stopped, then shattered into fragments, like a crushed egg.

Bone Emperor's body emerged, his lower half and one arm shattered, his mouth open in a terrified scream as he tried to flee, but he was unable to move.

"You've also heard that those who challenged my Dao Ancestor either entered the wheel of reincarnation or submitted to me. But now, you have no chance to take either path," the Palace Master said with a sigh, waving his sleeve.

The six-pointed wheel emitted a massive suction force, and Bone Emperor was drawn into the wheel of reincarnation.

The white bones in the air were also absorbed by the wheel, disappearing without a trace.

The wheel then flashed and disappeared into the void.

The turbulent void quickly calmed down, and space returned to normal.

"The Three Thousand Great Paths have lost another one. Who knows when it will reappear?" the Palace Master murmured, gazing at the calm void.

Witnessing Bone Emperor's sudden demise, the others were shocked to the core.

They had never imagined that the Turning Wheel King, who had once manipulated them, was not only cunning but also possessed incredible powers, making him a truly terrifying existence.
In that year, my incarnation left you a thread of life, and you were able to break free, so you should have cherished it, why did you come here to seek death?" The master of the Wheel of Rebirth looked at Xue Li and the others, shaking his head.

"Spare our lives, Wheel of Rebirth King..." Xue Li and the others had already been terrified, kneeling on the ground, kowtowing repeatedly.

"People often don't know the hardships of life, why are you ghosts from the underworld so stubborn, not knowing to repent until disaster strikes, but it's often too late, as the saying goes, 'those who commit evil will not live...'?" The master of the Wheel of Rebirth spoke in a detached tone, his eyes glancing at Han Li.

After speaking, he waved his sleeve, and a bloody aura surged out from his sleeve, spreading like smoke and dust.

Xue Li and the others were engulfed, their bodies turning to ashes, leaving only their white bones kneeling on the ground, still maintaining their previous posture.

But just a moment later, the white bones also turned to white crystal powder, scattering all over the ground.

Han Li stood aside, feeling his heart and spirit stirred, the master of the Wheel of Rebirth's power far surpassing his imagination.

At this time, the master of the Wheel of Rebirth suddenly turned his head, looking at Han Li, and said: "It's also time for us to meet, you've come yourself, saving me the trouble of sending someone to find you. Come with me into the hall."

Han Li heard this and his eyes flashed, a strange expression flickering in his eyes.

But he didn't hesitate, holding the Purple Spirit, and bringing the Wailing Soul and the others, he was about to walk towards the great hall.

"You and Jiao San come with me, the others wait outside." The master of the Wheel of Rebirth said, then turned and walked into the hall.

Han Li was taken aback, handing the Purple Spirit to the Wailing Soul, and nodding to Shi Chong and the others, indicating that he would be fine, then turned and walked away.

Jiao San followed behind Han Li, looking up at his back, a complex expression flashing in his eyes, and also walked in.

The heavy doors of the hall slowly closed, and the light inside the hall dimmed.

Han Li took a glance around, and found that the entire hall was very empty, with only a giant black stone stele standing in the back of the hall, with the two ancient characters "Wheel of Rebirth" written on it in red ink.

Han Li's eyes swept across, and his heart moved.

It seemed that this hidden force in the True Immortal Realm, which had been secretly opposing the Heavenly Court until now, was able to survive because it was hidden in this dark and mysterious place.

And this mysterious master of the Wheel of Rebirth, although his cultivation seemed to be below that of a Dao Ancestor, his true power had already surpassed that of an ordinary Dao Ancestor.

All of this made Han Li even more curious about the master of the Wheel of Rebirth.

For some reason, he felt a sense of familiarity with the master, and his intuition told him that the other party had no intention of harming him.

Just then, the master of the Wheel of Rebirth's body suddenly glowed, a dark red spiritual domain spreading out from his body, enveloping the entire hall.

Han Li was inside, and although he didn't feel any discomfort, he could clearly sense that his connection to the outside world had been severed, including his connection to the Wailing Soul and the others.

"Han Li, you've been involved in many things in the Wheel of Rebirth Hall, and you have a relationship with Jiao San, and this time you've also helped her, I should acknowledge your kindness." The master of the Wheel of Rebirth said.

"Jiao San has also helped me a lot, so there's no need to feel grateful." Han Li replied.

"Your cultivation of the Refining Spirit Technique has reached the fifth level, which is quite rare. But did Jiao San tell you about the benefits and drawbacks of this technique when she taught you the first few volumes?" The master of the Wheel of Rebirth asked.

"I do know some of the benefits and drawbacks, and I've also benefited from it, but this technique can't be stopped once it's started, or else there will be a risk of spiritual chaos." Han Li replied.

"That's correct, but you probably don't know why this technique is like this. I'll tell you the truth." The master of the Wheel of Rebirth said.

Han Li nodded, not speaking, waiting for the master to explain.

"This Refining Spirit Technique is a secret technique I created based on the Wheel of Rebirth's secret method, which rapidly increases the power of the spirit, but the source of this power is not from the outside world, but from the practitioner's own later lives, borrowing the spiritual power of their future reincarnations, once started, it cannot be stopped, so the higher the level of cultivation, the more spiritual power is borrowed, and the greater the power." The master of the Wheel of Rebirth said.

"This is like eating the seeds of the future, and the consequences will be endless, right?" Han Li's heart was shocked, and he said.

"Borrowing spiritual power for cultivation will not achieve perfection, and naturally, it will be countered by the spiritual thoughts of the future reincarnations, leading to madness and chaos... but if it can be cultivated to perfection, the fragmented spiritual power can be reunited, and a new balance can be achieved, and one will not be affected by the counterattack." The master of the Wheel of Rebirth nodded, and said.

"So, if cultivated to perfection, this technique is not only harmless, but also quite heaven-defying?" Han Li blurted out.

"In a sense, yes, but because the spiritual power of the future reincarnations is borrowed too much, once reincarnated, the spiritual power will be lost, and one will not have the qualifications to cultivate, and it's likely that one will be born as a foolish and ignorant person." The master of the Wheel of Rebirth said again.

"So, it's like walking on a path of no return." Han Li heard this, and fell into deep thought, and after a long time, he sighed and said.
