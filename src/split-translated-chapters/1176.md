Time trickled away, and the distant sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the peak. The square at the summit was already filled with nearly a hundred people, including over a dozen Da Luo realm cultivators. Among them were sixteen leaders of the sixteen great tribes, as well as a few leaders from the top hundred tribes. The remaining people were the most talented and pure-blooded young cultivators from each tribe, who had managed to pass the ancient mountain path trials and reach the summit.

The Huo Zhen tribe had the most people present, with over ten individuals, while the Ban Shan Yuan tribe had the least, with only Yuan Shan Bai.

The Huo Zhen tribe was one of the eight great true spirit tribes, and its people were the main descendants of the true spirit king, Luo Hou. The tribe was extremely powerful and its overall strength was even greater than that of the Ying Ma tribe.

The current leader of the Huo Zhen tribe was a tall, middle-aged man with a rough, ugly face, wearing a purple robe with a black scale armor on top. His muscles were bulging, and his eyes seemed to be bursting with explosive power.

He had a wide mouth and a sharp jawline, with purple whiskers that stuck out like steel needles. His aura was incredibly strong, comparable to that of a late-stage Da Luo cultivator.

At this moment, his eyes scanned the square, and a hint of doubt flashed across his face. He hesitated for a moment before approaching the center of the square, where he bowed to the person standing there.

That person was dressed in a white long robe, with a handsome face and an extraordinary aura. It was the true spirit king, Bai Ze.

"Your Majesty, the tribes have gathered, and there should be no more climbers on the ancient mountain path. Why haven't we begun the blood sacrifice ceremony yet?" the Huo Zhen tribe leader asked.

"Not yet, let's wait for one more person. They should be arriving soon," Bai Ze replied, glancing at the small white figure beside him.

As soon as he finished speaking, a low, suppressed roar echoed from the northern edge of the square, and a figure like a spider leapt out from the mountain wall, landing on the square.

The newcomer was none other than Han Li.

He had used the Heavenly Executioner's Prison and the true spirit bloodline, and had also employed the time law to aid him. After spending three hours, he finally reached the summit.

The small white figure immediately ran towards him, and Liu Le also rushed over with a smile.

Han Li's body flashed with light, and his three heads and six arms disappeared, returning to their original state.

However, his previous transformation had already caught the attention of the other people, and his unusual aura had also been detected by the crowd.

The Ban Shan Yuan tribe's elder, Li Mu, only narrowed his eyes, but did not show much surprise. The other tribe leaders, however, were not as calm.

"Is he a human? Why can a human climb our sacred mountain?" a tall, purple-faced man with short whiskers and a black wing on his back asked, his voice filled with anger.

He was the leader of the Fei Tian Bao tribe, which was also a descendant of the true spirit king, Zhu Hou. However, they were not as pure-blooded as the Zhu Hou tribe, and were instead a branch of the Zhu Hou tribe.

Although they were one of the sixteen great tribes, they had always been inferior to the Zhu Hou tribe.

"How can he have the aura of a true spirit? And not just one kind?" another man with a bird-like head and a silver wing on his back exclaimed, his eyes wide with shock.

He was the leader of the Yin Chi Lei Peng tribe, one of the sixteen great tribes.

Half of the other tribe leaders were also shocked and angry, and they all wanted to kill Han Li.

However, the leader of the Qing Yuan tribe, a hunched old man with a pale face, only smiled coldly to himself. He was one of the few who had known Han Li's identity beforehand.

Qing Hou and Qing Shu, who were standing behind him, also looked at Han Li with hatred in their eyes.

Bai Ze saw that the crowd was getting more and more agitated, and he frowned slightly.

"Everyone, please calm down. This Han Li is a friend of ours, and I have specifically invited him to attend the ceremony," Li Qi said, stepping forward to intervene.

The crowd immediately fell silent, although they were still filled with doubts and questions.

"Don't worry, this Han Li is a friend of our tribe. He is the one who found the isolated bloodline of the ancient true spirit king, Mo Yan Pi, and brought it back to us," Li Qi continued.

"Ah, it's him..." someone exclaimed.

It seemed that Han Li's exploits had already spread among the true spirits of the wilderness.

Han Li was not surprised by the crowd's reaction, and his eyes scanned the square. When his gaze fell on the Zhu Hou tribe, he paused for a moment. Wasn't that him?

He saw a tall, white-haired youth with a sinister face standing at the front of the Zhu Hou tribe, wearing a white and gold robe, with his hands clasped behind his back. The youth was smiling at him with a sly grin.
Han Li, of course, recognized the person at a glance, and the latter also recognized him at a glance.

The two of them had the same thought in their minds: what a coincidence...

When Han Li's gaze shifted again, it fell on the Tian Huo tribe, and he found that besides the few people who had climbed the mountain earlier, there was a familiar figure in the crowd, and it was none other than Huo San.

Huo San's eyes met Han Li's, and they nodded at each other slightly. Before they could connect their minds, Han Li was called over by Li Qi Ma, who led him to the center of the square.

"Pay respects to the True Spirit King," Han Li said, bowing to Bai Ze.

Bai Ze smiled and nodded, looking at the western sky, where the deep blue sky was already filled with stars, releasing a faint glow.

"The time is just right, the ceremony can begin," Bai Ze said, nodding to himself.

The various tribal leaders heard this and immediately began to organize their people, gathering them in an orderly fashion on the square.

Bai Ze walked to the front of the crowd, scanning the people with his eyes, and began to speak:

"Today's Blood Sacrifice Assembly is a rare grand event for our barbarian tribes, and it has been a long time since we have held such a gathering. The reasons for this are too numerous to mention. But now that the entire Immortal Realm is in chaos, it is likely that we have reached the point of the Great Calamity that Mu Yan's prophecy spoke of. Our barbarian tribes are also caught up in this, and it is a flood that cannot be stopped."

The crowd listened to this, and many of them looked puzzled and confused. Only the tribal leaders' expressions changed, and it was clear that they knew the prophecy of Mu Yan, the True Spirit King.

Han Li, of course, did not know about this, but he had personally experienced the changes in the Immortal Realm over the years and had caught a whiff of the situation. Therefore, he was more able to understand Bai Ze's words than some of the younger members of the barbarian tribes.

The great changes in the world can only be sensed by those who have already made preparations when the wind begins to rise, or even before it rises. Only then can they stand tall and proud when the storm breaks out.

Xiao Bai stood beside Han Li, and although he didn't understand what was being said, he knew that it was a prophecy left behind by Mu Yan, and so he listened very seriously.

"Today is the day when we will use the blood sacrifice to open the Barbarian Sacred Temple and unlock the Shura Blood Gate," Bai Ze continued, his eyes flashing with golden light. "The position of the Eight Barbarian Kings has been vacant for a long time, and it is also time for us to summon them back and restore the glory of the barbarian tribes."

"Eight Kings return, restore glory!"

"Eight Kings return, restore glory!"

...

These few short sentences ignited the passion of the barbarian tribes, and they began to shout loudly.

Han Li heard this and was slightly puzzled. Could it be that this Blood Sacrifice Assembly was some kind of ritual to summon the missing True Spirit Kings?

"The sixteen barbarian tribes, where are the people who will perform the blood sacrifice?" Bai Ze shouted.

Li Qi Ma stepped forward from the Ying Ma tribe, his chest held high, and stood at the front of the line.

From the Tian Huo tribe, Liu Le'er also stepped forward, coming to stand in front of her people.

Next, Qing Yuan from the Qing Yuan tribe stepped forward, his fangs, which had been broken by Han Li earlier, now seemingly restored to their original state.

From the Zhu Wu tribe, a young man with a sinister face and white hair stepped forward, his arms crossed, and stood at the front.

From the Hun Chou tribe, a giant of a man with a black scaled armor stepped forward, his face resembling a wild boar, with three pairs of sharp white teeth, curved like a hook.

From the Yin Chi Lei Peng tribe, a young man with silver hair and a red sleeveless shirt stepped forward, a golden lightning bolt scar on his forehead, and two wings on his back, with electric sparks flying around them.

From the Ban Shan tribe, the small white ape also stepped forward, looking over at Han Li.

Xiao Bai, who was standing beside Han Li, hesitated for a moment, then looked up at Han Li and followed his gaze.

Han Li smiled and nodded at him, and Xiao Bai left his side, coming to stand in front of the line.

These eight people were the direct descendants of the ancient barbarian eight kings, and the other eight tribes, such as the Tong Tian Mouse tribe, the Bai Zu Dragon tribe, the Hua Gu Snake tribe, and the Tong Bi Ape tribe, were all collateral descendants.

They each sent one person to participate in the ceremony, serving as accompanying sacrificers.

"All those who will perform the blood sacrifice, follow me into the temple," Bai Ze ordered. "The rest of you, wait on the square until the formation is opened."

"Obey the king's command," the crowd responded.

Bai Ze then turned and walked towards a round stone temple behind the square, followed by Li Qi Ma and the others.

"You also enter the temple," Bai Ze suddenly stopped and turned to Han Li, saying.
