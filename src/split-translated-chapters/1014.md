Qiu Changlao saw Ye Susu's appearance and frowned, taking a step forward, wanting to say something.

In her view, their young master was not yet familiar with the world, and his trust in Han Qianbei, a human, was a bit excessive. Seeing that she couldn't speak, she had the intention to ask Han Li to leave.

"Ye Gongzhu, since the Xian Gong's wanted poster has already reached Jin Xi City, it's only a matter of time before they find the Qing Huo tribe's head. If I continue to stay in Qing Huo City, I'll only bring trouble to you. I'll pack up and leave immediately." Before Qiu Changlao could speak, Han Li said solemnly:

Qiu Changlao heard this and her expression changed slightly, the words she had prepared to say were swallowed back, and her previous intention to be firm was rendered useless. She didn't expect Han Li to say this.

"Han Qianbei, I believe you're not a bad person, but..." Ye Susu said, feeling guilty.

"You don't need to feel guilty, I've been a burden to the Qing Huo tribe for a long time, and it's time for me to leave. Ti Hu, go pack up, we'll leave soon." Han Li smiled and waved his hand, turning to Ti Hu.

Ti Hu responded and entered the main hall.

There wasn't much to pack up in the house, only the sealing array that Han Li had set up needed to be dismantled.

"Han Qianbei, the Qing Huo tribe is just a small tribe, we can't resist the Xian Gong, we can only trouble you, please forgive us. But rest assured, we won't reveal any information about your stay here." Ye Susu bowed to Han Li and said.

"No, after we leave, tomorrow morning, you'll go to Jin Xi City and find the Xian Gong's investigator, report to them that we stayed in the Qing Huo tribe. Make sure the time is accurate, don't leave out any details." Han Li said, astonishing Ye Susu.

"What...Han Qianbei, what are you saying?" Ye Susu asked, not believing her ears.

Qiu Changlao heard this and her expression changed again, thinking for a moment before understanding the situation. She looked at Han Li with a changed gaze.

"Ye Gongzhu, don't be surprised, my intention is to let you report my whereabouts to the Xian Gong." Han Li smiled and said.

"Are you saying, let us guide them to the wrong direction, lead them to chase after us?" Ye Susu asked, slightly stunned.

"After we leave Qing Huo City, we'll continue north to the Jin Yuan mountain range. You must tell them our direction, don't change it, or it will bring disaster to the Qing Huo tribe. Remember, remember." Han Li shook his head and said.

" Han Qianbei, the more you explain, the more I don't understand." Ye Susu said, puzzled.

"Shaozhu, whether we report or not, the Xian Gong will find out that Han Qianbei was in our Qing Huo City. Rather than waiting for them to come and threaten us, it's better to report it ourselves. Han Qianbei is doing this to protect our Qing Huo tribe." Qiu Changlao said, breaking her silence.

"If you report, the Xian Gong will definitely come to investigate, and only if they find some useful information will they not bother you. Han Qianbei nodded and said.

Ye Susu heard this and finally understood, not knowing what to say.

" Han Qianbei's benevolence is not only saving our tribe leader but also considering our tribe's well-being. I previously thought of you as a small-minded person, and I'm truly ashamed." Qiu Changlao stood up, bowed to Han Li, and said.

"Qiu Changlao, don't be like that, during my stay in Qing Huo City, I've enjoyed the peace and quiet, and I should be the one thanking you." Han Li raised his hand to help Qiu Changlao up and said.

As they spoke, Ti Hu returned to the courtyard, nodded to Han Li, and the two of them prepared to leave.

Seeing Han Li about to leave, Ye Susu felt a pang of reluctance and asked, "Han Qianbei, will we meet again in the future?"

"Han Mou is troubled, it's better not to meet again." Han Li said, his expression unchanged.

He and Ti Hu appeared in the courtyard, bid farewell, and their bodies were enveloped in a flash of light as they disappeared into the sky.

Ye Susu looked at the empty courtyard, feeling a sense of loss.

"Shaozhu, if fate allows it, we'll meet again." Qiu Changlao walked up to her and said softly.

Ye Susu heard this and nodded, a smile on her face.

...

The flash of light that tore through the sky headed north, but didn't fly far, stopping at a mountain peak a few thousand miles away.

Han Li and Ti Hu appeared from the flash of light, standing at the edge of a cliff, looking out into the distance.

"Master, isn't it a bit too close to stay here?" Ti Hu asked.

"It's not, after the Qing Huo tribe reports, the Xian Gong will definitely send people to investigate. If we're too far away, and the people they send don't arrive, they'll return and report that they didn't find our tracks, which will still bring trouble to the Qing Huo tribe." Han Li shook his head and said slowly.

"Master is indeed thoughtful." Ti Hu smiled.

Han Li smiled back and said, "Let's go, we'll continue north to the Jin Yuan mountain range."
Han Li said, "The Qing Huo tribe may be weak, but their nature is simple and unassuming, and they do not contend with the world. They are completely different from the fox tribe I saw in the past..."

He suddenly stopped speaking, and a hint of nostalgia flashed in his eyes.

He didn't know how the little fox he had shared joys and sorrows with was doing in the Barbarian Realm.

"Master, since you have a favorable impression of the Qing Huo tribe, why not help them a bit? It would be good to let them not be controlled by the likes of the Jin Ma Sect," Qī Hún said, looking at Han Li.

"We currently have too many troubles to deal with, and we can't get too entangled with the Qing Huo tribe. Whatever we leave behind could bring them disaster, so we must be cautious. Let's wait until the future when we don't have so many restrictions, and then we can visit the Qing Huo tribe again," Han Li said with a sigh.

The two of them stayed there until noon, and Han Li took out a bi yu flying car, bringing Qī Hún with him as they flew into the sky and continued fleeing north.

...

Two days later.

Above the Qing Huo City, dozens of giant golden spirit ships were floating in the air, their hulls covered in spirit lights and symbols.

From a distance, one could see the flags waving on the decks, and thousands of armored warriors standing at attention, their spears and halberds like a forest.

Half of the Qing Huo City was shrouded in the shadow of the ships, and the fox tribe people looked up at the sky, trembling with fear.

At this moment, in a remote courtyard within the city, a group of people were standing.

One of them was a middle-aged man wearing a white silk robe, with a hint of gray in his temples, sitting at a stone table in the courtyard, gazing at the flowers in the garden with a faintly melancholic expression.

Behind him stood a young man in a colorful robe, and a large man in a black robe with a ghost head knife on his back, who were Táo Jī and Hei Dāo.

"Was the thief living in this courtyard before?" Táo Jī asked, his brow furrowed.

The several Qing Huo tribe people standing behind him nodded.

"Report to the Immortal Messenger, that person was living in this courtyard, and had been in seclusion for a long time. He suddenly left two days ago, and we didn't know why. We only received the news from the Jin Xī City yesterday, and immediately reported it," a woman in a tight-fitting green silk dress said, stepping forward and bowing slightly.

Yè Suǒ was standing beside Qīu Zhǎnglǎo, her lips pursed, and said nothing.

"Was it you who brought the thief back to your Qing Huo City?" Táo Jī asked, his eyes shifting to Yè Suǒ.

Yè Suǒ's heart skipped a beat when she heard this, but her expression didn't change much, and she replied calmly:

"It was me who brought him back to our tribe. After he saved me, I invited him to stay in our tribe as a token of gratitude. I didn't know he was... a wanted fugitive..."

"That person left two days ago, but you only reported it yesterday. Are you intentionally covering for him?" Táo Jī suddenly sneered.

"The Immortal Messenger is joking, right? This is a grave crime that our Qing Huo tribe cannot afford to bear. We really only received the news from the Jin Xī City yesterday, and immediately reported it, without any delay," Yè Luó said, hastily bowing.

"We beg the Immortal Messenger to see the truth!" Qīu Zhǎnglǎo and the others also bowed, their faces pale.

Yè Suǒ bowed as well, but in her heart, she was secretly resentful, thinking that these people from the Immortal Palace were hypocritical, and not as kind as Hán Lǐ, who seemed aloof and distant, but actually had a warm heart.

"Hmph! Whether or not we're joking, we'll know when Lǚ Zhǎnglǎo returns. If he doesn't find any evidence of the thief's trail heading north, then you're lying, and we'll punish you as accomplices," Táo Jī sneered.

Qīu Zhǎnglǎo and the others heard this, and their hearts tightened.

After all, not all the Qing Huo tribe people were as trusting of Hán Lǐ as Yè Suǒ. They were worried that if Hán Lǐ didn't follow the route he said he would, or didn't leave any evidence, then their Qing Huo tribe would be in danger.

"Why did you report him, when he had helped your Qing Huo tribe? Isn't that forgetting gratitude and repaying kindness with enmity?" Dōng Fāng Bái suddenly turned around, his eyes fixed on Yè Suǒ.

Yè Suǒ felt a surge of fear when he looked at her like that, and her heart tightened.

"R-reporting to the Immortal Messenger... I, we..." she stuttered, unable to say a complete sentence.

At this moment, a white jade hand stretched out from behind her, grasping her slightly chilly hand, and tightening it gently.

Yè Suǒ didn't need to look to know it was her mother, and her heart calmed down a bit.

"Reporting to the Immortal Messenger, that person indeed had a connection with our Qing Huo tribe, but he had been hiding in our tribe for over a hundred years. We had already repaid the kindness he showed us, and had unknowingly broken the laws of the Immortal Realm. We had already done enough. As for the past, we won't mention it, but now that we know he's a wanted fugitive, we Qing Huo tribe must report it. How could we not? That would be disloyal and unrighteous," Yè Suǒ said, her voice steady, repeating the words she had prepared earlier.

Dōng Fāng Bái listened, his face expressionless, his eyes still fixed on Yè Suǒ, trying to read her emotions.
