As soon as E'wa finished speaking, his figure suddenly flashed, like a black lightning bolt, and with a "chi la" sound, he appeared out of thin air in front of Han Li, reaching out his palm towards Han Li's neck.

Han Li seemed to have expected this, and in the instant E'wa reached out, he stopped his momentum and avoided E'wa's attack. He suddenly turned back, his speed doubling, and flew towards the blood lake.

As the lightning fell, just before it reached the surface of the lake, all the silver light suddenly converged, and Han Li's figure reappeared, with E'wa closely following behind.

"Kid, you really have a lot of tricks up your sleeve!" E'wa sneered and attacked again.

Seeing this, Han Li actually retreated instead of advancing, and went straight to meet E'wa.

He silently activated the Heaven Slaying Prison Suppression Technique, and the true spirit bloodline in his body also stirred. The Mountain Giant Ape and Xuanwu bloodlines were simultaneously stimulated. One of his arms suddenly swelled, and steel needle-like golden hairs emerged. On the back of his hand, pieces of cyan light armor appeared.

He punched out with a burst of starlight, which was suppressed under the Xuanwu turtle shell, and clashed with E'wa's punch.

A loud bang sounded.

Han Li felt his arm hurting and splitting, and his figure only retreated a step back, not being blown away. On the other hand, E'wa also took a step back.

Under the urging of the Heaven Slaying Prison Suppression Technique, the true spirit bloodline could burst out with such strong power, which was beyond his expectation.

E'wa's face tightened, and his eyes showed more solemnity.

But then, he took a step forward and suddenly appeared in front of Han Li. A layer of crystal light emerged on his dark arm, and he swung a fist at Han Li.

This punch had no sound of wind or thunder, nor any force of a thousand pounds. It looked light and floating, but its speed was extremely fast.

Han Li was caught off guard and had to activate the power of the Xuanwu bloodline to block with his arm.

Before the tortoise shell pattern on his arm could condense, it was shattered by E'wa's punch, and his whole body was sent flying backwards.

His figure slid across the surface of the blood lake, stirring up thousands of waves of blood, and crashed down beside Ziling.

Seeing this, E'wa did not continue to pursue, but walked on the waves and quickly arrived at the center of the blood lake.

He looked at the sacred corpse lying on the blood-colored crystal stone slab, his eyes revealing a complex expression of reminiscence, hatred, and unwillingness. He formed his fingers into a blade shape and suddenly inserted it towards the heart position of the sacred corpse.

At this moment, the complex patterns engraved on the blood-colored crystal stone slab suddenly lit up, and a layer of blood-colored light, as if it were solid, emerged from it, firmly supporting his palm, preventing him from stabbing down.

At the same time, a loud bang suddenly came from the shore of the blood lake, and Han Li's figure shot out again, rushing towards this side.

At this moment, he had already urged the Heaven Slaying Prison Suppression Technique to the extreme. More than four hundred Xuangliaos all over his body lit up, and almost all the true spirit power in his body was activated.

Behind him, the Mountain Giant Ape, Silver-Winged Thunder Roc, True Dragon, Sky Phoenix, Xuanwu... One by one, the true spirit phantoms appeared out of thin air and then entered his body one after another. Although his figure did not change, the aura on his body changed completely.

Lady Liu Hua looked at this strange scene with no expression on her face, but a hint of admiration flashed deep in her eyes.

Gu Qianxun and the others were also startled.

E'wa also noticed the changes in Han Li at this moment. His palm suddenly withdrew, and without saying a word, he gave up on the sacred corpse and retreated a thousand feet back.

But then, his figure suddenly rose again and rushed towards Han Li.

At the same time, he seemed to have stimulated some kind of demonic bloodline power in his body. There was a series of crackling sounds on his body, two white bone spikes grew on his forehead, his spine bulged upwards, and his vertebrae protruded, piercing through his skin and becoming visible.

As his appearance changed, the aura on E'wa's body became more and more fierce. The blood mist overflowing from his body surface became extremely turbid, and a strong smell of blood seeped out from it.

As he rushed forward, his figure was slightly hunched, his posture different from that of a human, but his speed was extremely fast.

Everyone only saw a blurred afterimage, which suddenly collided with Han Li's body.

A dragon roar and tiger howl-like beast roar sounded!

At the end of Han Li's fist, the star power gathered from the true spirit bloodline burst out, turning into a blinding white light, and collided with the overwhelming bloody aura.

Boom!

A white star and a blood-colored sun exploded at the same time.

The sky was filled with starlight and rolling blood qi, which stirred and dissolved each other. The two violent forces rose upwards at the same time, venting the power into the void above.

Rumble!

High in the sky, the wind and clouds changed dramatically, rumbling continuously, and the spatial cracks that burst out crisscrossed and could not disappear for a long time.

Then, on the edge of the blood lake, a loud shout rang out.

E'wa, who was in a stalemate with Han Li, suddenly focused his eyes, and the fist that was rushing forward suddenly pressed down. An even stronger force burst out again.

Han Li, who was already struggling to hold on, had already reached the peak of his true spirit bloodline and the Heaven Slaying Prison Suppression Technique's operation, with no possibility of further improvement. At this moment, he finally spat out a mouthful of blood, and his fist's momentum dissipated.

A blood-colored aura condensed and turned into a huge fist shadow, heavily blasting Han Li.
Boom!

Han Li's body was immediately sent flying backwards like a kite with its string cut, drawing a line of blood in the blood lake as he slammed into its depths.

The figure of E Xiu leaped up and descended from the sky, crashing into the blood lake. With both fists swinging, he frenziedly punched down into the bloody water, strike after strike.

The blood lake shook incessantly, its entire surface quickly receding, yet Han Li's figure was nowhere to be seen.

"Brother Li..." Shi Chuan Kong's face was deathly pale as he murmured.

Gu Qian Xun averted his gaze, unable to bear watching any longer. Liu Hua Madam also let out a long sigh.

Even the unconscious Zi Ling couldn't help but tightly knit her brows, appearing particularly pained.

...

At this moment, deep in the blood lake, Han Li felt his body being continuously struck by towering mountains and great peaks. All the bones in his body seemed to have shattered. He couldn't even struggle to dodge.

What was worse, he felt those punches raining down not only on his body, but also causing his sea of consciousness to shake violently. His divine sense was already somewhat scattered and his consciousness was becoming blurred.

The True Extreme Membrane on his body had long been shattered. The star power he had gathered with the last of his strength was also rapidly dissipating and draining away.

Only now did he realize that the gap between himself and E Xiu was ultimately too vast.

The moment of conclusion had finally arrived...

"Friend Li..." At this moment, a soft call echoed in his mind.

The voice seemed somewhat like Xie Dao Ren, yet also unfamiliar. Han Li wanted to respond but seemed unable to even gather his divine sense.

"Friend Li, I will lend you my Original Spirit Power. Do not resist." Another soft call.

Then, the sacred corpse lying on the blood-colored crystal stone board suddenly opened its eyes and came to life.

Its hands quickly formed a strange hand seal. A finger pointed at its own heart, then with a raise of the wrist, a strand of golden light flowed out from within, condensing at the fingertip and transforming into a golden pellet.

With a casual flick of the finger, the golden pellet turned into a streak of golden light, abruptly flashing and shooting into the blood lake.

"This is bad!"

E Xiu saw this and hastily waved his hand to block, but the golden pellet seemed to be guided, bypassing his fingers and directly entering Han Li's forehead.

"What is that...?" Liu Hua Madam witnessed this, utterly astonished.

"It's Immortal Spirit Power, it's Immortal Spirit Power..." Shi Chuan Kong sensed the aura, his expression drastically changing, crying out in shock.

Gu Qian Xun was filled with confusion, seemingly unfamiliar with this object.

At this moment, deep within the blood lake, blood suddenly surged, as if the first rays of the rising sun. Brilliant golden light gushed out from within.

E Xiu's gaze changed.

He found that his fists had become incomparably slow. In the surrounding void, there seemed to be countless invisible threads, like a woven net binding him, making his movements sluggish.

What shocked him even more was that his thoughts seemed to be slowing down immensely. By the time he realized this, it was already too late.

A massive hollow golden wheel had somehow appeared behind him at some point. The strands of time law power on its surface flowed like water waves, firmly shackling him in place.

E Xiu's strength was beyond doubt. Even being restrained by the True Word Treasure Wheel at such close range, his movements weren't completely sealed. When he sensed something amiss behind him, he even attempted to turn around and shatter the treasure wheel.

However, how could Han Li give him such an opportunity?

With a crackling electric sound.

A streak of golden lightning abruptly flashed. A Green Bamboo Wasp Cloud Sword that had been suppressed in Han Li's body for a long time finally broke free, carrying what seemed like reborn joy as it shot straight towards E Xiu before him.

Due to the extremely close distance between the two, almost instantly, the tip of the Green Bamboo Wasp Cloud Sword pierced into E Xiu's lower abdomen.

But E Xiu's physical strength was truly unimaginable. The power of a single Green Bamboo Wasp Cloud Sword was quite limited. It barely penetrated the outer wall of his dantian before it could advance no further.

At this moment, a roar sounded from underwater. Golden light shone from Han Li's palm, gathering the last remnants of his Immortal Spirit Power and physical strength, all of it slamming onto the sword hilt.

With a soft 'chi' sound.

The Green Bamboo Wasp Cloud Sword finally pierced through E Xiu's entire lower abdomen, directly nailing into his dantian.

"Zi la la..." A streak of golden electric light abruptly flashed. A thunderous explosion suddenly rang out.

A long, miserable cry escaped E Xiu's mouth. A bloody hole burst open in his dantian, from which rose a wisp of charred black smoke.

Immediately after, the blood light in his eyes began to recede, returning to their original color. The dark light on his body also gradually dissipated, but the protruding bones did not retract. His body stumbled back three steps before falling over onto his back.
