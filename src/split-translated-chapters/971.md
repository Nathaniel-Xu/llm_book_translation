Eight spider legs moved with the speed of lightning, but the white figure moved even faster.  With a stretch and a flick of his hands, the eight spider legs somehow fell into his grasp, and then he snapped them with force.

“Crack” sounded out as the eight spider legs were abruptly severed.

With a flick of his wrist, the eight spider legs transformed into eight black shadows that shot back with lightning speed, stabbing into Zhuo Ge's chest and penetrating through his body.

Zhuo Ge was knocked flying backward, but as he somersaulted in mid-air, he raised his hand and flung out a white cord from his sleeve. With a “Thud,” the cord stabbed into the rooftop and Zhuo Ge pulled himself up with the cord. He flew through a gaping hole in the rooftop and disappeared outside.

This series of actions was incredibly agile, with no signs of injury.

“Hmm!” The white figure exclaimed, but did not give chase. Instead, he flew downward.

The bloody aura below was only beginning to dissipate, and Hei Da's face was filled with fear as he urged the silvery leopard marionette, which had finally stabilized its form, to run toward the nearby wall and escape.

Just then, the white figure suddenly appeared above the silvery leopard's head, as phantom-like as a ghost.

“Hei Da, why are you in such a hurry to leave?” 

The figure spoke, and a white light enveloped his body, with an overwhelming power swirling within. The surrounding air seemed to ripple and undulate like the surface of water.

The silvery leopard marionette's head suddenly cracked open, revealing a large web of fractures.

Hei Da moved to jump down from the marionette and escape, but he reconsidered and froze, realizing that he was no match for the white figure's speed.

“Wise decision,” the white figure said, lifting his foot to deliver a kick.

A sharp, immense power exploded from his foot, piercing through the silvery leopard's head and creating a huge hole. The marionette's massive body crashed to the ground.

Hei Da's body trembled, and a flicker of fear crossed his face as he stood motionless.

A loud explosion boomed from the side, and two figures, Wu Yun and Hei Er, burst out from a nearby wall, which had been blasted open.

Seeing the situation with the blood array, they were shocked and immediately abandoned Zhu Zi Yuan and Zhu Zi Qing, turning to flee.

The white figure cast a glance in their direction but did not pursue them.

Zhu Zi Qing's face was filled with fear as she turned to flee, but Zhu Zi Yuan held her back. The two exchanged whispered words and then walked forward.

“Many thanks, Mr. Li, for your help today,” Zhu Zi Yuan said, his body covered in wounds, yet he stood ramrod straight and bowed to the white figure.

Zhu Zi Qing also bowed, thanking him.

The white light enveloping the figure dissipated, revealing Han Li's form.

“The people of Gui Cheng were the ones who left on their own, so you two don't need to thank me,” Han Li said, his eyes flicking toward the siblings before he turned away.

Han Li had no animosity toward Zhu Zi Yuan and his sister, but since E Mei and he were sworn enemies, he naturally did not want to associate with them.

“No matter what, we owe you a debt of gratitude, Mr. Li. I, Zhu Zi Yuan, will definitely repay you someday, thank you,” Zhu Zi Yuan said, turning to walk toward another large hole in the wall.

Zhu Zi Qing glanced at Han Li, her lips moving as if to say something, but she remained silent, following her brother through the hole.

The two quickly disappeared.

“Mr. Li, why did you let me stay behind? What do you want me to do?” Hei Da asked, his face uneasy, as he watched Han Li.

Han Li did not answer Hei Da's question, instead walking away.

“I won't harm you as long as your answers satisfy me. Follow me,” Han Li said, as he walked toward the nearby golden-winged vulture marionette.

Hei Da's face lit up with hope as he followed Han Li.

When they reached the marionette, Han Li gazed at it, his eyes slowly brightening.

“Gui Cheng's puppeteering method involves condensing mental energy into a physical form to control the marionettes, correct?” Han Li asked Hei Da.

“That's right,” Hei Da replied, hesitating for a moment.

“Condensing mental energy requires immense mental strength, and since everyone in Gui Cheng can control marionettes, you must have a secret technique that enhances mental energy. What is it called?” Han Li asked.

“We were taught the 'Puppet Heart' technique by the master of Sha Xin City,” Hei Da replied honestly.

“Tell me about this technique,” Han Li said, his voice cold as his eyes narrowed.

Hei Da's face changed, and he seemed hesitant.

“What's wrong? Does this put you in a difficult position?” Han Li asked, his face frosting over.

Hei Da's expression was troubled, as if caught in a dilemma.
"There's no need, the secret art is here, please take a look, Fellow Daoist Lai." Seeing Han Li's expression, Hei Da's heart skipped a beat, knowing that if he didn't comply, he would be on a path to death. He quickly put aside his reservations and handed over a jade slip.

Han Li's expression slightly eased, and he took the jade slip, merging his divine sense into it.

 Inside was a secret art for refining one's divine soul, divided into five layers, exceptionally exquisite, comparable to the Refining Divine Technique.

 Besides the "Puppet Heart", the jade slip also contained the secret art of transforming one's divine sense into a physical form, and controlling puppets, which was exceptionally mysterious.

 Han Li had always been extremely interested in the way of puppets, and he began to study it meticulously.

 After a short while, he put away the jade slip and raised his hands.

 With a soft hissing sound, thick crystal threads shot out from his fingertips, entering the Golden Winged Hawk's body.

 The Golden Winged Hawk's body glowed with golden light, and it immediately took to the air, hovering in mid-air.

 Hei Da was shocked upon seeing this scene.

 This puppet control technique was extremely profound, and even with sufficient divine sense power, it would take at least a hundred years of bitter practice to master. Yet, the person before him had managed to master it in an instant!

 Han Li moved, leaping onto the Golden Winged Hawk's back, and with a slight movement of his fingers, the Golden Winged Hawk darted out, circling and dancing through the air.

 However, his control was still somewhat clumsy, and the Golden Winged Hawk flew erratically, far from the exquisite control of Zhuo Ge or the previous Sand Heart.

 Han Li didn't linger in the air for long, soon stopping the Golden Winged Hawk and leaping off.

 This puppet control technique was quite profound, and he was only able to manage it by relying on his enormous divine sense power. Moreover, he didn't plan on using puppets for combat; he only wanted to familiarize himself with this path to make it easier to fight against the people of Puppet City in the future.

 "Earlier, I saw your Puppet City's puppets could shrink into a ball. What method did you use?" Han Li asked Hei Da once more.

 "That is a Secret Art of Collecting Puppets, invented by Sand Heart City Lord, combining puppetry with spatial secret techniques. The specific method of application is as follows." Hei Da had already informed Han Li of the "Puppet Heart" and the puppet control technique, so he didn't mind sharing more. He explained the Secret Art of Collecting Puppets to Han Li.

 The technique was quite complex, but Han Li had already mastered the puppet control technique. After a bit of practice, he quickly grasped this technique as well.

 He formed a seal with his hands, and several crystal lights entered the Golden Winged Hawk puppet's body.

 The Golden Winged Hawk puppet's surface glowed with golden light, and the massive puppet rapidly shrunk, transforming into a golden sphere within a few breaths, landing in his hand.

 Han Li was satisfied, nodding his head.

 "I don't know if Fellow Daoist Lai has any other questions. I'll answer them willingly." Hei Da's heart eased, and he spoke in an attempt to curry favor.

 "What is Puppet City's purpose for entering the Great Market this time?" Han Li asked, putting away the golden sphere.

 "According to Sand Heart City Lord, our city's objectives are twofold: one is to kill E Bei, and the other is to seize the Sacred Remains. As for whether there are other objectives, I'm not aware of them." Hei Da thought for a moment before answering.

 "There's one more question. You just need to answer clearly, and you can leave." Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he paused for a moment before speaking with a serious expression.

 "Fellow Daoist Lai, please ask." Hei Da's heart skipped a beat, and he hastily replied.

 "That black-robed woman who follows Sand Heart City Lord, I hear you call her Xiao Zi. What do you know about this person? When did she arrive in Puppet City?" Han Li spoke slowly.

 "I have a low status in Puppet City, and Xiao Zi always follows Sand Heart City Lord. Her personality is also somewhat cold, and she rarely interacts with outsiders. I only know that she has exceptional talent in puppet control techniques, and the City Lord places significant importance on her. As for when she arrived in Puppet City, I've been in closed-door cultivation for several hundred years, only coming out recently. At that time, Xiao Zi was already present, and it's said she arrived over a hundred years ago." Hei Da thought for a moment before answering.

 Han Li listened to his words, standing silently for a long while before lifting his head and saying, "Alright, you can leave."

 Hei Da was overjoyed upon hearing this, and he bowed to Han Li before swiftly departing, leaving behind the beheaded Silver Leopard Puppet.

 Han Li stood in place for a moment, taking a deep breath, and his expression returned to normal. He first put away Zhuo Ge's white wolf puppet, then walked to the blood pool's edge.

 The crying blood formation had exploded, and the five statues beside the blood pool had shattered, but the blood pool itself was relatively undamaged.

 He looked down at the blood pool's bottom, and his expression slightly changed.

 The blood-colored light door at the pool's bottom was now gone, without a trace.

 A person lay at the pool's bottom, motionless, and it was Fu Jian.

 Han Li's gaze flashed, and he leaped down, arriving beside Fu Jian's body. He probed with his divine sense.

 Fu Jian's body was almost completely ruined, his muscles and internal organs on the verge of collapse. His dantian's Evil Embryo was also nearing collapse.

 Although he still had some lingering vital energy, it was rapidly dissipating, and he would soon disappear completely.

 Han Li didn't have much goodwill towards Fu Jian, as they had previously had friction. However, seeing Fu Jian's current state, he couldn't help but feel a pang of sorrow.

 Nevertheless, he wouldn't take action to save him, nor did he possess such heaven-defying abilities. He soon shifted his gaze, looking at the spot where the blood-colored light door had been.

 However, there was nothing there now, not a single trace, as if the light door had never existed.

 Han Li's expression was calm, but his heart was filled with a sense of foreboding.
