Han Li saw this and his eyes widened in anger, holding his sword in one hand and forming a sword seal with the other. He didn't need to set up a sword array, and with a single sword strike, he chopped down towards Guo Huo.

A loud "boom" echoed, and the light on the Qingtian Bee Cloud Sword intensified, as 72 purple gold thunderbolts mixed with the aura of the ancient sword, condensed into a sword light that suddenly burst forth, like a massive purple gold dragon spanning the sky, shooting straight towards Guo Huo.

"Zzzip..."

The air was filled with electric lights, and the 72 thunderbolt sword dragons intertwined, instantly shredding the air within a radius of tens of thousands of miles, directly refining it into a golden liquid thunder pool.

At this moment, all things lost their luster, and the sky seemed to be filled with only this dazzling golden light, tearing through the entire horizon.

Guo Huo's figure was enveloped by the golden light, and countless chaotic misty auras were instantly torn apart, turning into powder and disappearing without a trace.

However, despite the purple gold thunderbolts imbued with the true intent of thunder striking him, Guo Huo didn't flinch, and instead, he calmly stepped out of the golden liquid thunder pool, walking towards Han Li step by step.

His pace was not fast, but with each step, the surrounding chaotic misty auras would envelop him, and when the mist dispersed, his figure would already be tens of thousands of miles away.

Therefore, he only took a few steps, and his figure appeared outside the thunder pool.

At this moment, Guo Huo's eyes seemed to have returned to their calm state, and there was no longer any anger or killing intent in them. It was as if he had returned to the tranquil and composed state he had when he first appeared at the Bodhi banquet.

But Han Li could sense a stern and unyielding aura emanating from Guo Huo.

As the respected Da Zu, who had controlled the Heavenly Court for countless years, he had finally become truly enraged.

Han Li grasped his sword with both hands and swung it continuously.

A series of purple gold sword dragons, each infused with the 72 purple gold thunderbolts, swept towards Guo Huo, dyeing the surrounding tens of thousands of miles into a vast, even more majestic thunder sea.

However, Guo Huo, under the protection of the chaotic misty auras, was unaffected, and he strolled through the thunder sea as if taking a leisurely walk, arriving within a thousand miles of Han Li in an instant.

Just as Guo Huo raised his hand to strike Han Li and reclaim the Heavenly Vessel, his expression suddenly changed, and he stopped in his tracks.

He slightly turned his head to look back, and saw that the residual corpse of the Wheel of Rebirth's master, which had been floating in the air, had disappeared. The six-path Wheel of Rebirth, which was not far away, began to rotate on its own.

The six symbols on the Wheel of Rebirth lit up simultaneously, and a dark red glow appeared in the center, followed by a figure emerging from it. The figure was tall and slender, with eyes that shone brightly – it was the Wheel of Rebirth's master.

As soon as the figure appeared, six dark red beams of light shot out from the six-path Wheel of Rebirth, twisting and intertwining in mid-air to form a dark red cage that encased Guo Huo.

"You're not that easy to kill," Guo Huo said, seemingly unphased. He raised his hand, and the dark red cage shattered, and he chuckled.

His words had barely ended when Han Li's voice echoed from a distance, extremely close to Guo Huo's ear.

"You shouldn't be so arrogant..."

Han Li's figure suddenly appeared beside Guo Huo, having abandoned the Qingtian Bee Cloud Sword. He transformed into a three-headed, six-armed divine demon, with the five Time Law artifacts, including the True Word Treasure Wheel, shining with a pure, crystal-like light, as they merged into his body.

The six massive arms of Han Li's divine demon form glowed with golden light, and six massive Five Elements Annihilation Fists struck out simultaneously.

"Boom boom boom..."

Outside Guo Huo's body, a series of chaotic whirlpools appeared, and the six divine fists struck them, their power being absorbed by the whirlpools like mud sinking into the sea, without any deviation.

Six fists didn't hit, so what about six hundred fists, six thousand fists, six million fists?

Han Li's figure was like lightning, his six arms transforming into a blur of afterimages, as he continuously struck Guo Huo with all his might, the air filled with the sound of thunder.

Guo Huo could initially handle it with ease, but as Han Li's fists continued to strike, their speed increasing with each passing moment, the power of the fists began to accumulate, layer upon layer.

Each fist's power was enough to shatter a continent, or even create a hole in the sky.

This terrifying power, which wasn't just a numerical increase, formed a massive fist aura barrier around Guo Huo, sealing him within.

As the millionth fist struck, Han Li's every subsequent fist would create a ripple in the fist aura barrier, shattering the surrounding air into layer upon layer of cracks.

Even the Wheel of Rebirth's master, who had just been revived, was forced to retreat, unable to approach.

The Demon Lord, who had sealed the heavens with his own dao, felt an overwhelming pressure, and his heart was filled with shock.

As Han Li's 1,672,000th fist struck, the suppressed power finally erupted, and a deafening boom shook the air.

"Boom boom boom..."

A blazing sun rose from Guo Huo's body, and dazzling golden light burst forth, radiating in all directions.

The Wheel of Rebirth's master saw this and his heart tightened, and the Wheel of Rebirth behind him moved, instantly retreating tens of thousands of miles.
The Demon Master didn't hesitate, directly dispelling the spatial barrier and appearing beside the Reincarnation Hall Master.

In the next instant, the golden sunlight that burst forth from the explosion engulfed the two, and their figures were submerged in the radiance.

They felt the surrounding void shatter as the golden light spread, and a massive attractive force emerged from the center of the explosion, drawing in the remaining heavenly and earthly spiritual energy and the dust particles floating in the void.

After a long time, the void finally stabilized.

The Reincarnation Hall Master, relying on his special connection with Han Li, sensed his location and looked over, seeing Han Li surrounded by a group of sword spirits, with no injuries, but his chest heaving violently.

The sword spirits, although unable to speak, flew around Han Li, checking if he was injured, and seemed very concerned.

In fact, after Han Li finished his 16 million punches, his body, as a Dao Ancestor, felt somewhat drained, and he relied on the sword spirits' Thunder Escape technique to successfully move away from the explosion's center.

Han Li's gaze swept the void, and his divine sense expanded, but he didn't find any signs of Guo or Jin.

He didn't relax his vigilance.

If Guo or Jin were so easily defeated, they wouldn't be Guo or Jin.

Especially now that Guo or Jin had merged with the Chaos Laws, they were not the same as before.

He looked towards the Palmtop Bottle, and saw that it had returned to its original size, shining with a soft green light, suspended in the void.

The terrifying explosion had no effect on it, and Han Li let out a sigh of relief.

The Reincarnation Hall Master and the Demon Master exchanged a glance, and flew towards Han Li.

"Haha..." But before they reached him, they heard a maniacal laughter echoing through the void.

The two stopped in their tracks, looking towards the sound.

A gray vortex appeared in the void, and a figure emerged from it – it was Guo or Jin.

Not only was he unscathed, but his aura was even stronger than before.

"You two are quite surprising, but that's all. This time, let's see what tricks you have up your sleeves..." Guo or Jin said, his eyes gleaming with amusement, as he reached out and grasped the Palmtop Bottle.

With a sneer, he said, "Let's see how you'll react this time..."

He then exerted a massive force, trying to crush the Palmtop Bottle.

However, as the gray light on his palm brightened, a dark green light burst forth from the bottle, forming a solid light shield that blocked Guo or Jin's hand.

Guo or Jin's eyes widened in surprise, and he increased his strength.

"Stop!" Han Li shouted, his figure disappearing from the spot.

Almost simultaneously, a sword light shot out from behind Guo or Jin, aiming for his back.

Without turning around, a Chaos light shield appeared, blocking the sword light.

The sword light was absorbed, but reappeared on Guo or Jin's side, stabbing towards his right hand, which held the Palmtop Bottle.

It was the Demon Master, using his spatial laws to redirect the sword light.

A muffled explosion sounded, and Guo or Jin's wrist shattered, his right hand falling off.

As the Palmtop Bottle fell, a silver light appeared below, and a spatial vortex formed.

Just as the bottle was about to fall into the vortex, Guo or Jin's severed wrist began to repair itself, and his hand reattached.

Guo or Jin's gaze turned cold, and he pressed the Palmtop Bottle against his chest.

The bottle began to sink into his chest, and a massive amount of Chaos energy poured into it.

The bottle's surface dimmed, and a gray light enveloped it.

A flame-like gray light erupted from Guo or Jin's chest, engulfing the Palmtop Bottle.
