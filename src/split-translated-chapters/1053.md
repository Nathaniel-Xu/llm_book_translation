After nearly half a day of fleeing, Su Zhongyan and the others finally managed to shake off the Fire Age Worms and reappeared near a small hill.

During this time, although Su Zhongyan had reminded them, most people had managed to conceal their auras, and there were no unexpected incidents. However, some people were still caught by the Fire Age Worms.

The others saw this and, even if they wanted to help, were unable to do so, and could only watch as those people were burned to ashes by the flames of the Fire Age Worms.

At this moment, although they had escaped the danger, many people still looked uneasy, with a lingering sense of fear.

Han Li found a secluded spot and sat down, taking a moment to catch his breath.

Su Zhongyan stood on a high ground, looking back at the distant horizon, where a massive dark red cloud of Fire Age Worms was slowly disappearing. Her expression finally relaxed slightly.

"I didn't expect there to be so many Fire Age Worms here," Fu Gu said, taking a deep breath. "Luckily, Su Xianzi understood the characteristics of these worms, otherwise we might not have been able to escape."

Su Zhongyan smiled faintly. "Fu Gu, you're being too polite. I only happened to read about these worms in some ancient texts."

"This tower is full of mysteries," Fu Gu sighed. "Who knows what other traps and mechanisms are waiting for us?"

Su Zhongyan suddenly looked at Han Li and asked, "Stone, you were the first to retreat when you saw the Fire Age Worms. Have you encountered them before?"

The others remembered this and turned to look at Han Li, their expressions filled with suspicion.

"Stone, why didn't you tell us about this?" Jing Liu asked, his voice cold. "Did you want to get us killed?"

The others' gazes turned unfriendly.

"No, no, I just encountered them before in another secret realm," Han Li hastily explained. "I recognized them because I had a bad experience with them."

Jing Liu snorted. "Is that so?"

Fu Gu intervened, saying, "Stone is skilled in escape techniques, and he was at the back of the group. When he saw the situation was bad, he naturally retreated faster."

Su Zhongyan looked at Han Li deeply, but then turned away, seemingly uninterested in pursuing the matter further.

Han Li didn't care about the others' opinions. He just smiled to himself.

Although this incident with the Fire Age Worms was a good opportunity for him to act alone, he didn't plan to do so yet. He still didn't understand the situation in the tower and wanted to continue observing the group for a while.

"Let's discuss what to do next," a hunchbacked old man said, his cultivation at the early stage of the Taiyi Realm. "Should we continue forward?"

After the intense battles, only a few Taiyi Realm cultivators remained in the group.

Originally, the Tian Shui Sect had four Taiyi Realm cultivators, but one had followed Han Li into the Golden Gate and died inside. Now, only three remained.

The other Taiyi Realm cultivators were the Qing Suo Sect's leader, the Mo Xiang Sect's leader, the hunchbacked old man, and a man with a thick beard, totaling seven people.

"This tower is full of mysteries," the Mo Xiang Sect's leader, Yan Yin, said, her expression uneasy. "We've been walking for a long time, and we haven't gained anything. We've only encountered danger and suffered heavy losses. I think it's unwise to continue advancing."

Many people nodded in agreement, including the hunchbacked old man.

"Su Xianzi, do you think we should retreat?" Yan Yin asked.

Su Zhongyan looked at Yan Yin and the hunchbacked old man. "Are you saying we should give up halfway?"

The hunchbacked old man shook his head. "Su Xianzi, we're not afraid. It's just that this tower is too dangerous. Those metal beasts almost wiped us out, and now we've encountered so many Fire Age Worms. Who knows what other dangers lie ahead?"

Su Zhongyan fell silent.

Jing Liu spoke up, "We can't give up now. This is the secret realm of the Tai Sui Immortal, and there must be treasures hidden within. We just need to be careful and avoid those Fire Age Worms. We can't let our fears hold us back."

The others looked at each other, seemingly hesitant.

Su Zhongyan added, "If we encounter those worms again, I might have a way to help everyone avoid them."

Yan Yin and the hunchbacked old man exchanged a glance, then nodded. "Alright, let's continue forward for a while and see what happens."

Jing Liu smiled. "Fate is often found in the midst of danger. This tower has been sealed for so long, I'm sure it won't disappoint us."

Su Zhongyan nodded. "Since everyone agrees, let's continue forward."

The group quickly set off again, flying towards the unknown.

Han Li didn't have any objections. If the majority of the group had decided to retreat, he would have considered acting alone.
He patted his buttocks and stood up, continuing to float at the end of the entire team, neither too close nor too far away.

Most of the people present snickered at Han Li's behavior, but no one said anything, and almost everyone had made a mental note that even if they gained something good in the tower, they would not easily benefit Han Li.

The journey that followed was more cautious, and the team's speed slowed down significantly.

The team had been moving forward for less than half an hour when Han Li's eyes flickered, and he glanced to the right front without saying a word.

Just then, Su Zhan Ci, who was at the front of the team, suddenly stopped and said, "Be careful, another fire age glowworm has appeared! Follow me!"

She quickly turned around and flew towards the left front of the ground.

Han Li was slightly surprised that Su Zhan Ci could also detect the glowworms in advance.

It seemed that her divine sense was not much weaker than his own.

The others quickly followed, using their techniques to hide their physical auras and followed Su Zhan Ci.

The team quickly landed on the ground and hid behind a small hill.

Su Zhan Ci raised her hand and released a small yellow flag from her sleeve, which turned into a large patch of yellow mist, enveloping the team.

The yellow mist fluctuated and quickly disappeared into thin air.

Just as the team had hidden, a buzzing sound came from the sky again, and a large red glowworm cloud appeared in the distance, flying quickly towards them.

The team held their breath, hiding behind the hill, and fortunately, Su Zhan Ci's magical artifact was effective, and the glowworms did not discover them.

The team let out a sigh of relief and waited for the glowworms to fly away before continuing on their journey.

Han Li looked at the glowworms in the distance and had a slight reaction.

This time, the glowworms seemed to be patrolling.

After confirming that the glowworms had left, the team quickly set off again.

The journey continued, and the team encountered several more groups of fire age glowworms, but they were all detected in advance and avoided.

After advancing for more than half a day, the terrain changed again, and a range of continuous red mountains appeared.

The mountains were densely packed, with countless volcanoes, some towering high into the sky, while others were only a few dozen feet tall.

Most of the volcanoes were still active, with loud rumbling sounds and continuous eruptions of hot lava.

The sky was filled with a thick layer of black-red fire clouds, and the air was filled with the pungent smell of sulfur. The temperature was even more scorching than before, and the fire attribute energy in the air was extremely dense.

The team's spirits were shaken, and they quickly accelerated, flying into the mountains.

"Ah! This is the Golden Flame Sacred Stone!" a loose cultivator exclaimed, flying down to a nearby volcano and using a large red hand to grab a golden stone from the wall, which flashed with flame-like golden light.

"Xuan Yan Ling Yu!" another person exclaimed, finding a red spirit jade.

"Long Yan Cao!"

"Tian Huo Jing!"

...

The team discovered various precious fire-attribute materials in the volcanic region, and they quickly began to collect them.

Han Li was not particularly interested in these materials, but he also collected a few.

After a round of searching, the team had a small harvest, and their confidence increased. Under Su Zhan Ci's leadership, they continued to venture deeper into the volcanic region.

"Be careful, another fire age glowworm has appeared!" Su Zhan Ci suddenly warned again.

The team was no longer as panicked as before, and under Su Zhan Ci's arrangement, they gathered together in an orderly manner, hiding their tracks.

Before long, a massive red glowworm cloud appeared in the distance, its scale more than ten times larger than the previous ones. It was like a dark cloud covering the sky, blocking out the sun.

The team's faces turned pale, and they were shocked, even though they were under Su Zhan Ci's magical artifact's protection.
