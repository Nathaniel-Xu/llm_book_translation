A figure flew in, landing beside Han Li, and it was Fu Gu Zhu, who placed his hands on the stone door and said to Han Li, "Leave this to me, Stone Brother, you go help Su Xianzi and the others."

"That's fine, I'll leave it to you, Fu Gu Zhu," Han Li replied.

Han Li glanced at Fu Gu Zhu, then turned and flew towards the Flame Age Worm King.

The battle against the Flame Age Worm King was not going well, as the attacks from Lian Dui Da Han and the others were almost all blocked by the Flame Age Worm King's Age Flames.

Han Li's body flashed, and he appeared above the Flame Age Worm King, his hand forming a seal as he prepared to do something.

"Stone Brother, I'll help you!" Lian Dui Da Han shouted, also flying towards the Worm King.

"Don't come over!" Han Li shouted, but it was too late.

The Flame Age Worm King's body erupted in a burst of flames, which formed a blazing sun that shot out countless flames that enveloped Han Li and Lian Dui Da Han.

Lian Dui Da Han tried to retreat, but it was too late, and his body was pierced by the flames, turning into a ball of fire.

Han Li's eyes flashed with a cold light, and his body glowed with a golden light, his speed suddenly increasing several times over, and his body undergoing an impossible twisting and deformation, as if it was not a physical body at all. He dodged the flames and appeared in front of the Flame Age Worm King.

The Flame Age Worm King's eyes widened in surprise, and it tried to do something, but its brain suddenly felt a sharp pain, and its body curled up.

At this moment, a golden light appeared in Han Li's hand, and it was a golden sword with Time Law crystals wrapped around it, emitting a powerful Time Law energy.

The nearby heaven and earth energy trembled, and a golden thread shot out, instantly tearing apart the Flame Age Worm King's Age Flames and sweeping across its neck.

The Flame Age Worm King's head fell off with a "plop" sound.

Jin Liu's face relaxed, and he immediately stopped his Three Cauldron Formation, then flew out and shot towards the three beehives on the ground.

Han Li's heart also relaxed, and he put away the golden sword, but seeing Jin Liu's actions, he also flew towards the beehives.

He appeared in front of one of the beehives, waved his hand, and a golden light enveloped it, collecting it.

Jin Liu also flew to another beehive and collected one.

Then, the two of them simultaneously flew towards the third beehive, but they hesitated, fearing they might damage it.

"Stone Brother, you've already collected one beehive, do you still want the second one? Isn't that too greedy?" Jin Liu said, his eyes flashing with cold light.

"I'll say the same to you, Jin Liu. You didn't contribute much to the battle, but you want to monopolize two beehives. Isn't that too shameless?" Han Li replied, his face expressionless.

"If not for our Tian Shui Sect's secret technique, which restrained the Flame Age Worm King, could you have killed it? I'm collecting the second beehive for Su Dao, with her contributions, it's not a problem for her to have one," Jin Liu said, his face red with anger.

"Then let Su Dao come and collect it herself. Who knows what you'll do with it afterwards?" Han Li said, not giving Jin Liu any face.

"You're talking nonsense! You're not giving me any face!" Jin Liu's face turned red with rage.

"Jin Liu, let Stone Brother have the beehive," Su Zhuo Xian's voice came from afar.

She appeared at the entrance of the stone door, waving her hand and sending out a blue light that merged with Han Li's blue stone door, firmly attaching it to the entrance and blocking the outside insect swarm.

"Su Dao, what are you saying? This is...?" Jin Liu's eyebrows were tightly furrowed, and he was very dissatisfied.

"In this battle, Stone Brother made great contributions, and it's only natural that he should have two beehives. Moreover, he just saved my life, so I'm just returning the favor," Su Zhuo Xian continued.

Han Li heard this and raised an eyebrow, looking at Su Zhuo Xian in surprise.

"Fine, you've got it!" Jin Liu's face changed, and he angrily retracted his hand.

Han Li didn't hesitate, waving his hand and collecting the third beehive, then flying to the entrance of the cave, where he formed a seal with his hands.

A golden light entered the blue stone door, forming a thick golden light screen, which had a seal pattern that emitted a powerful Time Law energy. With Su Zhuo Xian's secret technique, the stone door was stabilized and no longer trembled.

"Let's go!" Su Zhuo Xian said, looking at Han Li and flying towards the lava lake's passageway.

Without the Flame Age Worm King's blessing, the passageway's flame barrier disappeared, and Su Zhuo Xian flew into it.

The others also flew into the passageway.

Su Zhuo Xian waited until everyone had entered, then turned around and waved her hand.

A blue light shot out from her palm, forming a thick blue ice crystal that blocked the passageway's entrance.

The others saw this and also cast their secret techniques or used their magical tools, adding several layers of restrictions to the passageway, sealing it tightly before continuing on.
The passageway was not long, and the group soon arrived at the end.

At the end of the passageway was a small stone chamber, and in the center stood a dark red light gate, identical to the transmission light gate they had seen before.

Next to the light gate was a stone stele, with a line of ancient text written on it.

"Prison Gate" "Forbidden Entry"

Han Li and the others saw the text on the stele, and their faces changed. They looked at each other.

"Prison Gate? Could it be that this Years Tower is actually a prison tower?" Fu Gu Zhu said, muttering to himself.

"If that's the case, the metal beasts on the first floor and the fire years worm on the second floor were actually the guards? Now that I think about it, it's not impossible." Han Li said, deep in thought.

He had seen the fire years worm earlier, and it had looked like a patrolling army. If it was said that the Years Immortal had set up the guards, many things would make sense.

"Rather than guessing here, let's just go to the third floor and take a look. We'll know everything then." Su Zhen Cai said.

The others heard her words, and their eyes all turned to the dark red light gate.

The gate was surrounded by a layer of dark red evil light, and it looked no different from an ordinary barrier. However, on the surface, there were ripples of golden light.

Han Li's eyes fell on the light gate, and his eyebrows furrowed slightly. He felt a strange and inexplicable feeling, and the light gate barrier in front of him seemed unusual.

Jin Liu's eyes also fell on the light gate, but he seemed to have not noticed anything unusual. He was about to start breaking the seal.

Han Li opened his mouth, wanting to stop him, but he thought better of it.

"Stone friend, what's wrong?" Fu Gu Zhu seemed to have noticed Han Li's abnormal behavior, and he asked in a low voice.

"I don't know, I just feel a chill down my spine... " Han Li didn't want to explain, so he just brushed it off.

When the others heard this, their faces all changed, and they became tense. Even Jin Liu stopped in his tracks, turned around, and looked at Han Li.

Han Li's face was expressionless, and he didn't react.

"Fake!"

Jin Liu cursed in a low voice, and then turned back to the stone gate. He hesitated for a moment before starting to break the seal.

Not long after, a red light flashed on the stone gate, and the golden ripples on the light gate disappeared.

"It's done, the seal is open. You can all go in now." Jin Liu said, glancing at Fu Gu Zhu and the others.

But these people just looked at each other, and no one took a step forward.

"Have you all come this far, only to retreat now? Fu Gu Zhu, why don't you set an example?" Jin Liu asked.

Fu Gu Zhu heard his words, and his face tightened. He didn't immediately respond.

Su Zhen Cai coldly laughed, and without Jin Liu's permission, she took the lead and stepped into the light gate.

Jin Liu didn't have time to react, and he quickly followed her in. The others looked at Fu Gu Zhu.

Fu Gu Zhu's face changed several times, and finally, he clapped his hands and said, "Wealth and honor are found in danger. Let's go."

After saying that, he took the lead and stepped through the light gate, disappearing into the stone gate.

Han Li didn't wait long, and he followed closely behind, stepping into the light gate. His figure disappeared from view.

As soon as he entered the light gate, Han Li felt a wave of dizziness, and his heart tightened. Fortunately, there was nothing else unusual, and when he regained his footing, he found himself in a vast, black stone-paved square.

The square was filled with leaden clouds, and the wind howled. The sky was dark, and the air was filled with a putrid and evil aura.

Han Li saw that the others who had entered before him were all standing still, their eyebrows furrowed as they looked at something behind him. Their faces changed, and their eyebrows twisted.

"Indeed... " Han Li slowly turned around, and sighed.

Behind him stood a massive stone gate, over a hundred feet tall. The gate pillars were carved with two golden armored warriors, holding axes and glaring angrily. The gate was covered in intricate, strange symbols.

"What is this? Why are there so many complex seals?" Su Zhen Cai asked, her face full of doubt.

"This stone gate has thirty-six different types of symbols, and seventy-two lines of text. It seems to match the number of heavenly stems and earthly branches, used to enhance the sealing and suppression power." Jin Liu said, his brow furrowed.

"The seal we encountered when we entered was not this strict. Why is the seal for leaving so complex? Is it trying to trap us inside?" Fu Gu Zhu asked, shocked.

Han Li looked far into the distance, and said, "The seal on this stone gate is not meant to block us, but perhaps something else."

Fu Gu Zhu followed Han Li's gaze, and in the distance, he saw a black building, surrounded by black mist. It was hard to make out.
