What a bamboo, no insight at all! Alright, I'll first seal the power of these green bamboos, then you carefully take out these green bamboos, and there will be a great use for them later." Gui Wu sneered and said.

As soon as his voice fell, his figure emerged, and he spat out a stream of gray smoke, enveloping the cluster of green bamboos.

The smoke instantly flew into the green bamboos, and gray stripes appeared on the surface of the green bamboos, as if they were sealed.

Han Li saw this scene, and his eyes flashed. He swung his hands, and two crescent-shaped golden lights shot out from his palms, flying quickly to the ground and digging up the cluster of green bamboos along with the surrounding soil, and storing them in the Floral Space.

"Excuse me, everyone, this green bamboo is of great use to me, so I've taken a detour. I hope you won't mind." Han Li turned to face Shi Chuan Kong and the others.

"No problem, but Han friend, who is this?" Shi Chuan Kong waved his hand, looking at Gui Wu.

"This is Gui Wu, a friend I rescued on the road, a residual soul." Gui Wu's identity was special, and Han Li didn't say much, despite his good relationship with Shi Chuan Kong.

"Ah, Gui Wu friend, nice to meet you." Shi Chuan Kong cupped his hands and bowed.

Gui Wu glanced at Shi Chuan Kong, nodded, and flew back into the black box.

Taking the green bamboos was just a small episode, and they quickly continued on their way.

With Han Li's protection and the presence of Ti Hun, who specialized in restraining ghostly creatures, their journey was quite smooth.

After another month of flying, Han Li and his group finally escaped the Hundred Ghost Forest and arrived at a vast, boundless gray wasteland.

"How far is the Yellow Spring Marsh?" Han Li asked, looking far into the distance.

"We're here, we're here. You should be able to see a red region in the distance, that's it." Gui Wu replied hastily.

Han Li's pupils constricted, and in the distance, he saw a layer of red mist rising like steam, covering a large area.

Seeing this, he called out and flew forward.

Zi Ling and the others followed closely behind.

The air was filled with a unique, indescribable smell, making it hard to breathe, and the sensation of suffocation grew stronger as they approached the area.

As they drew near, Han Li and his group saw a massive lake in front of them.

The lake's surface was incredibly wide, almost comparable to the vast ocean, and its edges were invisible. The water near the shore was smooth as a mirror, without a single ripple.

However, as they looked further out, they saw a thick, heavy blood cloud accumulating in the high skies above the lake's center, merging with the chaotic clouds below, forming a massive, turbulent region.

In the north of the dark red lake, the sky seemed to be torn apart, and a blood-red waterfall flowed out, hanging in the air like a red ribbon.

The waterfall seemed to be powerful, with a fierce torrent, but when it landed on the lake's surface, it made no sound, as if it were a feather falling into water.

Along the lake's shore, towering stone fortresses stood at regular intervals, each over a hundred meters high, with dark red walls and giant flags bearing strange totems, some resembling ox heads, others horse faces, all different.

"That... is the garrison of the four great ghost tribes." Gui Wu's voice echoed.

Han Li's thoughts stirred, and his divine sense instantly expanded, probing the dark red stone fortresses.

After investigating, he frowned and looked at Ti Hun, who shook his head.

"Empty." Han Li announced.

"See, now you should believe me, right?" Gui Wu said.

"Now that the four great ghost tribes have no troops stationed here, we have one less problem. Tell us, where is the Six Paths Reincarnation Plate now?" Han Li asked.

Gui Wu's residual soul floated out, pointing to the center of the lake, and said:

"It's in the center of the marsh."

Han Li's gaze fell on the turbulent blood cloud in the lake's center, and his expression turned slightly solemn. He asked:

"Didn't you say earlier that the Six Paths Reincarnation Plate was on the lake's shore? Why is it now in the lake's center?"

Gui Wu's expression changed, and fear flashed in his eyes. He hesitated and said:

"I... I was afraid you wouldn't dare to come if you knew it was in the center of the Yellow Spring Marsh."

In reality, Han Li had no idea what the Yellow Spring Marsh was like or what dangers it held. Even if Gui Wu had told him the truth about the Six Paths Reincarnation Plate's location, Han Li wouldn't have been deterred.
Han Li asked, "You're saying that the Yellow Springs Great Marsh is a place of danger too?"

Guī Wū's expression slightly eased, and he said, "Han Dao friend, you're asking this, so you probably don't know why the Yellow Springs Great Marsh is called that. Let me explain it to you."

Han Li and the others exchanged a glance, and then they all gathered around, listening carefully to Guī Wū's words.

"The reason this dark red lake is called the Yellow Springs Great Marsh is because the lake bed is covered in soul-devouring springs. These springs can absorb a person's three souls and seven spirits. If all three souls are absorbed, the spirit will directly fall into reincarnation, and the physical body will be left at the lake bed, slowly decaying and disappearing, merging with the marsh." Guī Wū explained.

Zi Líng said, "What about it? As long as we fly high enough, we won't be sucked in."

Guī Wū said, "That's true, but have you seen the blood cloud in the lake?"

Shí Chuān Kōng asked, "What's strange about the blood cloud?"

Guī Wū replied, "The blood cloud isn't strange, but the wind that blows it out is."

Han Li thought for a moment, and then he said, "The wind that blows the blood cloud is visible, but the wind that's not visible is even more treacherous."

Guī Wū said, "This is a rotating wind that's hard to detect. If you're not careful, you might not even notice it's there. But in reality, it's almost everywhere in the marsh. If you get caught in it, your flesh and blood will be stripped away in an instant. It doesn't matter if you're a powerful cultivator or a barbarian, the only difference is how long it takes."

Han Li frowned, "And if you get caught in the rotating wind, you'll definitely fall into the water, and your spirit will be devoured, reincarnating again."

Zi Líng said, "That's not a problem, we can just use a magical boat to cross the lake, carefully avoiding the rotating wind."

Guī Wū said, "You can't do that. The water in this marsh is like the Weak Water of the Ninth Heaven, it's too dense for even a feather to float on. No matter how powerful your magical boat is, it will sink into the water."

Jīn Tóng heard this and turned his wrist, a flash of light appeared in his palm, and a white hair floated out.

Han Li raised an eyebrow, realizing that the hair was a strand of Xiǎo Bái's fur, but he didn't know when Jīn Tóng had plucked it.

Jīn Tóng gently blew on the hair, and it floated onto the lake's surface.

As Guī Wū had said, the hair floated and sank into the water, gradually disappearing.

Jīn Tóng said, "It's really true that not even a hair can float on this water?"

Han Li frowned, suddenly remembering something, and he turned his wrist, a flash of light appeared in his palm, and a small object floated out.

"You had us cut down that green bamboo earlier, was it for crossing the river?" Han Li asked.

Guī Wū nodded, "That's right, Han Dao friend. The only thing that can float on the Yellow Springs Great Marsh is the Naihe bamboo. So, if you want to cross, you'll have to make a boat out of it."

Han Li threw the bamboo into the air, and it landed in the water with a soft splash.

The bamboo didn't make a sound as it entered the water, and it didn't splash any water. It simply floated on the surface, half-submerged.

Han Li asked, "Now that we have the Naihe bamboo, how do we deal with the rotating wind?"

Guī Wū said, "The rotating wind may seem chaotic, but I've observed it for tens of thousands of years, and I discovered that there's a hidden waterway that can be used to avoid it. If you follow that waterway, you can cross the lake safely."

Han Li nodded, and then he threw a jade slip to Guī Wū.

"Use your divine sense to record the path of the rotating wind on the jade slip, and mark the hidden waterway clearly," Han Li said.

Guī Wū received the jade slip, and his expression was slightly awkward. He smiled wryly and closed his eyes, grasping the jade slip tightly.

The others took out the Naihe bamboo they had cut down earlier and began to make two small boats.

Han Li said, "The rotating wind is dense, and the waterway is narrow. We can't make a big boat, so let's just make two small boats that can hold one or two people. We'll use one boat to cross the lake, and the other will be a spare, just in case."

Shí Chuān Kōng said, "Han Dao friend, your planning is always so thorough. I have to admire you."

Jīn Tóng and Zi Líng exchanged a glance, and they both smiled, seeming to be pleased with themselves. Only Zi Líng looked at Han Li deeply, a hint of a smile on her face.

Han Li just smiled slightly, not saying anything, and began to make the boats.

Before long, two small boats made of Naihe bamboo were completed, each about three feet long and six feet wide. They were well-made and looked sturdy.

At the same time, Guī Wū finished drawing the map of the rotating wind, and he handed the jade slip back to Han Li.
