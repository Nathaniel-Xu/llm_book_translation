"It's hard to get a good sleep, and yet I was still woken up."

Just as everyone's hearts were in a state of unease and the atmosphere was tense, Hei Tian Mo Zu suddenly stretched his waist, let out a yawn, and shouted.

Everyone was taken aback, unsure of what to make of it, when Hei Tian Mo Zu suddenly spat towards the direction of the Sheng Deng, cursing.

"Ah! Tai Sui old dog, you've been deceiving me for so long..."

"I'll ask you, where is my son? Tell me, where is my son now? If you don't say, I'll make sure you pay for it today..."

Hei Tian Mo Zu's face turned red with anger, and he suddenly began to rant and rave, his voice echoing through the air.

This scene left everyone, including Han Li and Lei Yu Ce, in a state of shock. The Hei Tian Mo Zu before them was completely different from the evil and cruel figure they had imagined.

"You won't say, is that right? Then I'll make you pay for it today!"

After finishing his rant, Hei Tian Mo Zu seemed to still be unsatisfied, and his body suddenly burst forth with energy as he charged towards the Sheng Deng.

Without the restraint of the Daoyin Zhenren, the original formation of the altar was mostly destroyed, and the Sheng Deng could only rely on its defensive instincts to release layers of golden light to block Hei Tian Mo Zu's attack.

Hei Tian Mo Zu's voice continued to shout and curse as he swung his fists at the Sheng Deng, and his body released a massive amount of black smoke that seemed to erupt like a volcano, causing the entire temple to shake violently.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he saw a massive shadowy figure emerging from the smoke, which seemed to be Hei Tian Mo Zu's true form as a demon. However, it was not a physical entity, but rather a manifestation of his aura.

Even so, the aura that emerged from the smoke was still shocking.

The shadowy figure seemed to have twelve arms, which moved up and down in the smoke, constantly attacking the Sheng Deng with powerful blows.

The Sheng Deng's golden light trembled, and the flames danced wildly as a large amount of oil spilled out, splashing everywhere and forming a sea of golden fire that almost engulfed the entire temple.

Han Li and the others were forced to retreat to the edge of the temple, avoiding the flames and smoke.

The temple continued to shake violently, and the shadowy figure in the smoke did not stop its attack, constantly pounding against the Sheng Deng.

The Sheng Deng was unscathed, but the temple was on the verge of collapse.

Finally, with a loud crash, the roof of the temple was torn open, and the original formation was destroyed.

As the temple collapsed, the restraints that held everyone in place were lifted, and they were able to escape.

Lei Yu Ce and the others quickly grabbed the unconscious Daoyin Zhenren and Su Jinzhu, and they all fled the temple.

However, as they emerged from the temple, they were met with a massive black lotus formation that surrounded the entire area, trapping them.

The black lotus petals were layered on top of each other, each one a thousand feet high, and the air above was filled with a dark cloud that seemed to have the same aura as Hei Tian Mo Zu.

The group from the Tong Tian Sword Sect had no choice but to charge forward, their swords shining brightly as they attacked the black lotus.

With a loud crash, the five-colored sword light shattered, but the black lotus remained unscathed.

"Can't you just let me sleep in peace?"

Hei Tian Mo Zu, who was still attacking the Sheng Deng, suddenly stopped and looked up, his brow furrowed in annoyance.

He stretched out his hand, and a giant black palm emerged from the void, grabbing the group from the Tong Tian Sword Sect and pulling them back.

The group was thrown back into the temple, and a series of black whips formed from the smoke, striking down at them with incredible force.

"You're disturbing my peace, you're absolutely evil! You think you can just leave?" Hei Tian Mo Zu's voice echoed from the smoke.

Han Li and the others were forced to return to the temple, hovering in mid-air.

"Brother Jiao, this Hei Tian Mo Zu's brain doesn't seem to be working properly..." Han Li whispered to Jiao, puzzled.

Jiao was also at a loss for words.

At this moment, the black smoke in the temple began to rapidly contract, flowing back into Hei Tian Mo Zu's body.

Hei Tian Mo Zu reappeared, his face twisted in anger as he looked at the still-intact Sheng Deng.

"Why can't I break this thing?" he muttered to himself.

His gaze then turned to the Wu Xing Yun Kong formation, which was still intact.

"Ah, what's this thing? It looks interesting. Let me play with it, hehe..." Hei Tian Mo Zu said, his voice filled with curiosity.

To everyone's shock, he jumped into the formation, his face filled with a puzzled expression.

"How do you use this thing..."
"Oh, I remember now..." he said, slapping his palm after thinking for a while.

As soon as he spoke, his body suddenly radiated a brilliant light, and five columns of divine energy condensed behind him, like spider legs, extended out and landed on the five treasures: the golden long sword and the yellow large seal.

In just a few dozen breaths, the five treasures, which were not of low rank, were already partially refined by him.

Immediately, he whispered a few words, and the yellow large seal and the other treasures suddenly lit up with a brilliant light. The Five Elements Suppressing Void Array reactivated, condensing a five-colored light ball that enveloped the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor.

"What is he doing?" Han Li frowned, puzzled.

"Could it be..." Jiao San's expression changed, muttering to himself.

Qi Mozi's face was uncertain, his eyes wandering, as if thinking about something.

Just as everyone was puzzled, the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor suddenly clenched his hands, and a brilliant light burst forth from his palms, flying into the Five Elements Suppressing Void Array.

The five-colored light ball condensed by the array suddenly brightened, as if stimulated.

A power of void annihilation immediately spread within the light screen, and the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor's body suddenly shattered, turning into a pile of black powder.

The hall was silent, with everyone stunned, finding it hard to understand what had just happened.

"Did this old demon... play himself to death?" Huo San muttered.

"He's not dead, he's indeed a crazy old man..." Han Li sighed, making a definitive statement.

As soon as he spoke, a black smoke suddenly rose from the five-colored light ball, condensing into a human figure, which was naturally the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor.

"Haha... refreshing, it's been a long time since I've taken a bath, this time..." The old demon's body had just appeared when he burst out laughing.

However, his words were cut short, as the five-colored light ball flashed again, and the power of void annihilation exploded, his body shattering once more, turning into powder.

But immediately, another cloud of smoke rose, and his figure recondensed.

"Can I finally get clean..." The old demon seemed to be continuing his previous words, but his body shattered again, turning into powder.

"He's definitely not right in the head..." This time, Huo San didn't dare to speak out loud, instead transmitting his thoughts to Jiao San and Han Li.

For a while, the Five Elements Suppressing Void Array rumbled continuously, the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor's body shattering and recondensing repeatedly.

However, as time passed, his body became more solid, and the array's attempts to destroy him became increasingly difficult.

The Black Heaven Demon Ancestor began to frolic in the five-colored light screen, stretching his limbs and swimming in the void, completely disregarding the onlookers.

Finally, as the array's attacks weakened, the old demon himself grew tired.

"This thing is not worth playing with..." The Black Heaven Demon Ancestor muttered to himself.

He changed his hand seals, and his hands grasped the air, pouring divine energy into the treasures.

The treasures suddenly lit up, and five different colored lights burst forth, merging into the five-colored light ball.

The light ball's power surged, and a far stronger power of void annihilation exploded, the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor's body shattering instantly, turning into powder.

At the same time, the light screen shook violently, and a series of visible void ripples spread within, as fist-sized five-colored light balls broke off from the screen and flew in all directions.

Although the light balls were small, they contained the array's true power of void annihilation.

Han Li and the others didn't feel they had the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor's physical strength and cultivation, so they didn't dare to confront the light balls, instead choosing to dodge and hide.

The golden hall was filled with the sound of explosions, and the walls, which had been relatively intact, were now riddled with holes, on the verge of collapse.

Han Li had long since retreated, putting as much distance between himself and the remnants of the hall.

However, just as he narrowly avoided a five-colored light ball that had pierced through the wall, Qi Mozi suddenly appeared beside him, wielding the black short axe, and slashed at Han Li with a dozen swift strikes.

The sound of breaking air filled the void, as layers of black axe silhouettes enveloped Han Li from both sides, forcing him to reverse his True Speech Wheel, and his body suddenly leapt upwards.

But above him, a five-colored light ball was heading straight for him, leaving him no room to dodge.

The situation had become precarious!
