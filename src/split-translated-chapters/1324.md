Han Li felt the shock of the Lei Kui's image disappearing, the changes in the heavens and the earth, and the endless power emanating from the Heavenly Gate. He was shocked beyond measure.

After a long time, he finally came back to his senses, muttering to himself:

"This eye... is actually a relic of the Dao Ancestor!"

Even after withdrawing the Eye of Truth and recalling the True Speech Treasure Wheel, Han Li's emotions were still difficult to calm.

Until now, the world had never heard of the existence of a Lightning Dao Ancestor. And this Lei Kui giant beast was likely the previous Lightning Dao Ancestor, whose innate lightning body allowed it to roam freely in the Nine Heavens' divine lightning. However, as it harmonized with the heavens and the earth, its final destination was to be consumed by the Heavenly Dao, becoming a part of the heavens and the earth.

This Lightning Eye was the last remnant left behind by the Lei Kui before it was consumed by the Heavenly Dao.

Han Li once again fully activated the Refining Spirit Technique, carefully examining the Lightning Eye. He discovered that the power contained within was even more terrifying than he had anticipated, but it had already transformed into pure lightning energy, without any remaining will or intent from the Lei Kui.

However, after a moment's thought, Han Li relaxed.

If there were any remaining divine intent in the Lightning Eye, it would have already been re-cultivated and reborn. Why would it remain in this sea region, day after day? Moreover, after being consumed by the Heavenly Dao, how could there be any remaining divine intent?

He gazed at the orange-yellow giant eye for a moment, then suddenly snapped his fingers.

A layer of golden light expanded rapidly from his surroundings, enveloping the entire Thunderstorm Ocean.

At the same time, Han Li's body activated the Great Five Elements Fantastical World Technique, and the True Speech Treasure Wheel, along with other time-space law objects, appeared and transformed into mountains, rivers, and stars, surrounding the Thunderstorm Ocean.

As soon as the five objects, which contained powerful time-space laws, appeared, they immediately triggered the Thunderstorm Ocean's crazy resistance. The orange-yellow eye "gazed" at Han Li, and the nine heavens' clouds rumbled loudly.

The entire Thunderstorm Ocean became more frantic than ever, with all the lightning pillars falling continuously, like a never-ending waterfall, striking Han Li's mountains and rivers.

Han Li ignored this, his mind moving to freeze time. The falling lightning, sparkling with electricity, stopped in mid-air, without any movement or sound.

In this small world, only Han Li could move freely.

He waved his hand, and his feet stepped through the void, with the seventy-two Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Swords floating behind him, following him as he walked.

Han Li circled around the Lei Kui's eye, stopping every few steps, and with a wave of his hand, a Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword would fly out, suspended in the air outside the giant eye.

After three hundred and sixty steps, the seventy-two Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Swords were all in position, arranged around the giant eye.

Han Li carefully checked the position of each sword, confirming that they were all correct. Then, with a flip of his hand, a white, eight-sided jade plate appeared in his palm.

This was the Heavenly Sword Array's diagram.

During his years of closed-door cultivation, Han Li had not relaxed his research on this diagram. As his cultivation grew, he finally solved the mystery of the jade plate.

He had originally thought that this object should have been created by the founder of the Heavenly Sword Sect, but later discovered that it was too profound, beyond human capabilities. It should be a manifestation of the sword's laws, a mysterious object of the heavens.

This sword array had no five-element attributes, but because it used different flying sword attributes, it could unleash different attributes of powerful might. It was as if it contained the sword's laws, allowing it to accommodate any attribute and unleash its power.

At this moment, the sword array set up by the Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Swords was a kind of "Great Refining" array from the Heavenly Sword Array, and Han Li was going to use this array to refine the Lei Kui's eye.

After setting up the array, Han Li clasped his hands together, and a chanting sound emerged from his mouth.

A faint humming sound was heard, and the eight-sided jade plate trembled slightly, its symbols moving rapidly like flowing clouds. Suddenly, a brilliant light burst forth, and a giant eight-sided light plate appeared above the Lei Kui's eye.

Han Li saw this and leapt up, landing on the eight-sided light plate. He sat down in the lotus position, his eyes closed, and his hands clasped together.

The light plate beneath him burst into light, and countless illusory sword shadows flew out, like a spring rain, pouring down onto the giant eye below.

The seventy-two Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Swords also trembled, their bodies shining with golden light, connecting with each other in the void, forming a giant eight-trigram furnace, enclosing the Lei Kui's eye.

The eight-sided light plate, transformed from the sword array diagram, was like a furnace lid, covering the furnace's interior.

A series of loud rumbling sounds echoed, and the Lei Kui's eye, which had been calm, suddenly shone with a golden light. The lightning in the clouds outside stopped, and the thunderstorm ocean fell silent.

In the next instant, a group of Lei Kui illusions emerged from the eye, surrounded by the purest golden lightning in the heavens, charging towards the eight-trigram furnace, their bodies shrouded in purple smoke, their auras boundless.

"Boom, boom, boom..."
Every time the Lei Kui struck, a thunderous roar shook the sky, and the entire sea of thunderstorms trembled violently. 

Han Li sat steadily on the eight-sided light disc, his body also trembling violently, with threads of numbness and electric currents piercing through his body. 

However, at this moment, he couldn't afford to be distracted, he had to strictly control all the flying swords and the array diagram, or else once the Lei Kui burst out, the entire eight trigrams furnace would explode, and the entire sea of thunderstorms and the two nearby continents would be ravaged by unprecedented thunderstorms, erasing them from the map of the Northern Frost Domain.

"Sword Guard for Attack, Great Refining of the Mystic Void..." Han Li's voice was low and clear.

The 72 flying swords and the array diagram simultaneously unleashed their power, countless sword energies and sword shadows surged into the furnace, refining the Lei Kui's eye like a furnace fire.

...

At the same time, on the edge of the Huolan Continent.

Tens of thousands of gray boundary creatures, like a swarm of locusts, crowded at the edge of the land, gazing out at the sea of thunderstorms across the sea.

Standing at the forefront of these gray boundary creatures were hundreds of gray boundary cultivators, led by a tall, black-robed man with a suit of armor covered in green copper rust, his skin deathly pale, his expression grave.

"Lord Mo Shi, do you want to investigate?" a frail old man standing behind him asked in a hoarse voice.

"No need, whatever is there, it's not something we can handle, as long as it doesn't provoke us, let's not stir up trouble, just keep a close eye on it," the tall man, Mo Shi, shook his head and said.

"Yes," the frail old man replied immediately.

"Restrain these creatures, don't provoke them, there are still some cities on the Huolan Continent that haven't been conquered, we need to speed up," Mo Shi ordered.

This time, including the frail old man, several gray boundary cultivators responded in unison: "Yes, sir."

...

Time passed, and several months had gone by.

The sea of thunderstorms had undergone a heaven-shaking transformation, the original boundless sea of thunderstorms had disappeared, leaving only a region of thunderclouds less than a hundred miles in diameter.

And within this region, a figure was walking around a furnace, his brow furrowed, looking quite frustrated, it was naturally Han Li.

"It's already been refined, why can't it be opened?" Han Li muttered to himself, stroking his chin.

 Inside the furnace, a dragon-eye-sized orange-yellow eyeball could be seen, surrounded by a layer of golden electricity, constantly emitting a "zizzling" sound.

Around the eyeball, 72 shrunken Qingtong Flying Cloud Swords were hovering, linked by electricity, looking like a single entity.

According to Han Li's original plan, with the help of the Tongtian Sword Array, he could refine the Lei Kui's eye into the 72 Qingtong Flying Cloud Swords, raising their quality to the level of a 4th-grade immortal artifact.

But for some reason, despite the refinement being successful, the Lei Kui's eye refused to split, and naturally, it couldn't be fully absorbed into the 72 swords.

"What's the problem? How can I break..." Han Li muttered to himself.

At this moment, he suddenly had an idea, a hint of excitement in his eyes, and he turned his wrist, a flash of light appearing in his palm.

Only to see that in the light, he had obtained a greenish-blue Xuantian Gourd. This Xuantian Gourd had absorbed the residual power of the Xuantian Zhanling Sword, and inside it was the power of destruction, using it to help break open the Lei Kui's eye, wouldn't that be perfect?

As soon as he thought of this, Han Li hesitated, the Lei Kui's eye, although refined, was still a relic of the Dao Ancestor, its internal power was not ordinary, and the Xuantian Gourd was not of sufficient grade, it might not be able to withstand its power.

"Seems like there's no better way, I'll just send the Qingtong Flying Cloud Swords in together, to help suppress the Lei Kui's eye," Han Li thought of a not-so-good plan, muttering to himself.

As soon as he finished speaking, he didn't hesitate, he pointed his finger, and the eight trigrams furnace disappeared, the Lei Kui's eye and the Qingtong Flying Cloud Swords were exposed in the void.

In an instant, the remaining thunderclouds within a hundred miles erupted violently, with lightning flashing and thunder booming.

Han Li saw this, and quickly raised the Xuantian Gourd, reciting a few words, and tapping the bottom of the gourd.

The Xuantian Gourd flashed with light, and a green mist erupted from its mouth, condensing into a misty vortex that rotated violently.

With a loud whooshing sound, a powerful tearing force emerged from the vortex.

Han Li held the gourd in one hand, and with the other, he guided the Lei Kui's eye and the Qingtong Flying Cloud Swords into the green vortex, absorbing them into the Xuantian Gourd.

As soon as the eyeball and the flying swords entered the Xuantian Gourd, the thunderous sounds in the surrounding sky and earth suddenly subsided.
