The stone gate was adorned with ancient, simple patterns, exuding a sense of age and antiquity, making it clear that it was something from tens of thousands of years ago.

On the top of the stone gate, the words "Taisheng Xianfu" were written in ancient script, possibly because of the passage of time, the characters were no longer clear, but could still be made out.

...

Inside the secret realm, within the canyon.

The gray mist in front of him churned and rolled, rapidly retreating backwards.

Han Li's face lit up with joy, and he swiftly flew towards the front, closely pursuing the gray mist.

A few days ago, the gray mist had been slowly dissipating, revealing new areas of the secret realm, but the speed of its dissipation was not fast, and he could only follow slowly behind. Now, he felt a sense of exhilaration.

After flying for a moment, the scenery in front of him suddenly opened up, and he finally reached the end of the canyon.

Han Li's figure flashed, and he stopped in mid-air.

The gray mist quickly dispersed, revealing a vast area.

The sky was a brilliant blue, with white clouds floating lazily, and the ground below was a boundless plain, covered in green grass. A gentle breeze blew from afar, carrying a refreshing and clean air that made one's heart feel at ease.

In the distance, he could see some mountain peaks and rugged ridges, dotting the landscape.

The scenery before him was like a beautiful painting, unfolding before his eyes.

He took a deep breath, and his tense heart relaxed slightly.

However, Han Li soon regained his composure.

This was not the time to appreciate the scenery, as he could feel the entrance to the secret realm's space at the bottom of the canyon fluctuating wildly, and the fluctuations were growing stronger, as if it was about to open again.

Han Li didn't know that outside, a large crowd had already gathered, but he could guess that if the entrance opened again, it would attract people.

He lightly exhaled, and then fully opened his divine sense, spreading it outwards.

The next moment, his eyes lit up, and a golden light appeared on his body.

A loud clap of thunder boomed, and his figure disappeared, reappearing on a mountain peak.

On the mountain peak stood a white, jade-like building, emitting a gentle, white glow.

However, the building was surrounded by a white, shimmering light screen, which seemed extraordinary.

Han Li raised his arm, and a finger drew a line in the air.

With a "whooshing" sound, a hundred-meter-long golden sword light shot out from his sleeve, slashing towards the white light screen surrounding the building. The sword light cut through the air, causing the surrounding space to vibrate and emit a sharp, piercing sound, as if it was about to be split open.

Han Li's cultivation had broken through to the peak of the Taiyi Realm, and the power of the Qingtian Cloud Sword had increased again.

However, the golden sword light slashed against the white light screen, which vibrated and resisted, but ultimately held firm.

"What a sturdy restriction..." Han Li's eyebrows rose, and he appeared in front of the building, punching the white light screen.

With a "popping" sound, the white light screen shattered, and Han Li's figure fell into the building. A moment later, he flew out, his face filled with excitement.

Han Li didn't linger, and his body's golden light flashed, disappearing once again.

...

At this moment, outside the secret realm.

"Taisheng Fu!" The crowd saw the stone gate rising from the ground, and most people looked puzzled, clearly having never heard of this name.

However, Su Zhi, Jing Liu, and Lei Yuze's faces lit up with excitement.

In the corner of the crowd, Qimozi's body shook, and his face revealed a look of shock.

Xiong Shan saw Qimozi's expression and wanted to ask, but didn't.

"Taisheng, your cave is here! Good, good, coming to the Jinyuan Xian Domain this time was indeed the right decision!" Qimozi's eyes flashed with excitement.
