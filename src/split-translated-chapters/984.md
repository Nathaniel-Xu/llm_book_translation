Shi Chuankong, who was beside them, heard the conversation between Madam Liu Hua and Sha Xin, and after a moment of contemplation, he stepped forward.

"City Lord Sha Xin, I have something I would like to discuss with you. Would you be willing to spare some time for a conversation?" Shi Chuankong said with a slight bow.

"Brother Shi, what is it? Please feel free to speak your mind." Sha Xin glanced at Shi Chuankong and said calmly.

"Can we talk in private?" Shi Chuankong added.

Sha Xin's eyebrows twitched slightly, and a sharp gleam flashed in his eyes.

Shi Chuankong just smiled and calmly met Sha Xin's scrutinizing gaze.

Sha Xin retracted the sharpness in his eyes, nodded, and stood up to walk with Shi Chuankong to a nearby spot, where they began to communicate through voice transmission.

...

In the underground space.

Han Li carried Zi Ling to a flat area and placed her on the ground.

He then took out a healing pill and fed it to Zi Ling. Afterwards, he sat quietly beside her, carefully examining her sleeping face.

Time passed bit by bit, and in the blink of an eye, more than half an hour had gone by.

Zi Ling's delicate eyebrows furrowed slightly, and she let out a soft whimper as she opened her eyes.

"You're awake?" Han Li leaned in to look at her, his eyes flashing with excitement.

Zi Ling's bright, intelligent eyes looked back at him, no longer showing any confusion, clearly having fully regained her mental clarity.

The next moment, her delicate body stiffened, and her beautiful eyes stared blankly at Han Li.

"Is it really you?" She reached out to gently caress Han Li's cheek, murmuring to herself, as if she had gone silly.

"It's me. These years have been hard on you." Han Li grasped Zi Ling's soft hand and said softly.

The two did not speak further, but just gazed at each other, both seemingly immersed in the joy of reuniting in another realm after so many years apart.

Han Li looked at Zi Ling's incomparably beautiful face, and memories of the past flashed through his mind one by one.

From their chance encounter in the Chaotic Star Sea, to their shared hardships in the Void Sky Palace and the Netherworld, their joint venture into the Fallen Devil Valley, and the deep bond they formed, leading to their travels together in the Great Jin, and finally, their reunion in the Devil Realm...

These scenes were like they had happened just yesterday, and they were etched in his heart and soul.

Now, in the blink of an eye, tens of thousands of years had passed, and looking back, though her beauty remained unchanged, everything else was different, as if a world apart.

In Zi Ling's bright eyes, like mirrors of water, Han Li's every minute facial expression was reflected, and she too seemed to be lost in memories of the past.

"I thought that after ascending to the upper realm, I wouldn't know how long it would take to see you again, considering how vast this place is... I didn't expect to meet you so soon, and under such circumstances." After a long while, Zi Ling's expression regained its calmness, and she spoke.

"It was all a coincidence. I came to the Devil Realm because of a certain matter, otherwise I don't know how long it would have taken to meet you." Seeing this, Han Li also regained his composure from his earlier emotional state and smiled.

They were both strong-willed individuals, and even though they had reunited after a long separation, they quickly restrained their surging emotions.

"By the way, I remember entering the Jilin Void Realm and then being taken into the Puppet City by City Lord Sha Xin. How did I end up here? And where is this place?" Zi Ling looked around, her face showing confusion.

"This is the Great Ruins, deep within the Jilin Void Realm. After you entered the Puppet City, Sha Xin must have used some means to seal your divine soul, which is why you don't remember what happened during this time..." Han Li recounted what had happened since their reunion, as well as what he had heard about Zi Ling from the people of the Puppet City.

"I see. I didn't expect City Lord Sha Xin to seal my memories. Fortunately, she didn't have any ill intentions towards me, otherwise we wouldn't have been able to meet safely today." Zi Ling murmured to herself, then smiled.

"It is said that 'one should not harbor ill intentions towards others, but one must always be on guard against others.' We don't know Sha Xin's temperament well, so it's best to be cautious." Han Li said.

"Yes, I understand. I was a bit careless before." Zi Ling nodded obediently.

"By the way, how were things in the lower realm after I ascended? And how did you ascend so quickly? With your aptitude, according to my estimation, it shouldn't have happened so fast." Han Li seemed to have thought of something else and asked with some confusion.
"You want to ask about Sister Nangong's situation, right? Just ask directly, no need to beat around the bush." Zi Ling glanced at Han Li.

Han Li did indeed have that intention, and being seen through by Zi Ling, he immediately felt a bit embarrassed.

"Don't worry, before I underwent my tribulation, I went to the Spirit Realm to investigate. With the foundation you left behind, everything in the Qing Yuan Palace is normal. Sister Nangong's cultivation is also very smooth, and she has already reached the Mahayana Realm. She is currently accumulating resources and making preparations in order to pass through the Ascension Tribulation as soon as possible... As for me, it's because of some opportunities that came my way, so the story is long. That's why I passed through the tribulation earlier than Sister Nangong and them." Zi Ling said calmly.

Hearing this, Han Li's expression didn't change much on the surface, but inwardly he secretly let out a sigh of relief.

"What you cultivate is a genuine human race technique, and the place of ascension should be the Immortal Domain, right? How did you end up in the Devil Domain?" Zi Ling asked.

"When I ascended, it was indeed in the Northern Cold Immortal Domain of the True Immortal Realm. Afterwards, many things happened before I arrived in the Devil Domain." Han Li nodded and said.

"Although I haven't been in the Devil Domain for long, I know that the Devil Domain and the Immortal Domain are sworn enemies. I'm curious, how did you end up traveling with the prince of the Night Sun Dynasty, and seemingly on good terms?" Zi Ling blinked her eyes and asked.

"That's a long story. After I ascended to the Northern Cold Immortal Domain, I encountered powerful enemies and was severely injured and lost my memory. I drifted into the Spirit Border Realm and only managed to recover my cultivation with great difficulty before returning to the True Immortal Realm... Afterwards, I went to the Black River Water Palace to look for you, and learned that you had been taken into the Accumulated Scale Void, so I also entered the Accumulated Scale Void. Heaven helps those with an unyielding heart, and I finally found you." Han Li recounted his experiences over these years in detail. Aside from matters like the Heaven Bottle that were inconvenient to mention, he hid nothing and roughly told Zi Ling everything.

Hearing Han Li's incredible experiences with their dramatic ups and downs, Zi Ling's expression changed again and again. Even with her resolute and firm temperament, her heart couldn't help but be moved by Han Li's story.

Especially when she heard that Han Li had entered the Accumulated Scale Void to search for her despite the strange dangers, her heart was even more touched.

After a long time, Han Li finally finished speaking. Zi Ling stared blankly into the void in front of her, lost in thought.

"Although I knew early on that you were someone with great divine powers and great fortune, and that your abilities were far beyond what I could anticipate, I still couldn't imagine that you experienced so many things over these years. Moreover, your cultivation has already soared to the Grand Unity Realm. During this time, you must have suffered untold hardships." Zi Ling sighed and said softly.

"I did encounter some dangers, but since they're all in the past now, they naturally don't matter anymore. Furthermore, if I hadn't encountered so many obstacles, my cultivation wouldn't have improved so quickly. This is what they call 'misfortune, upon which good fortune leans'." Han Li said with a carefree laugh.

"You're quite open-minded. But what are your plans next?" Zi Ling smiled and didn't dwell on the matter, changing the subject.

"I previously promised Crab Daoist friend that I would protect him here until he fully recovers. After that, I'll leave the Accumulated Scale Void and find a way to return to the True Immortal Realm." Han Li thought for a moment and said.

"Crab Daoist friend has a way to leave the Accumulated Scale Void?" Zi Ling's pretty face froze, and she asked in surprise.

"Haha, Zi Ling Daoist friend, don't worry. Once I fully recover, I'll be able to drive the origin power of the Accumulated Scale Void and send people outside, allowing you and your partner to escape this dangerous place together." Crab Daoist's voice suddenly rang out without warning, and he laughed loudly.

Hearing this, Zi Ling's face flushed bright red.

"Zi Ling, you just ascended to the Devil Domain, and your cultivation isn't strong yet. In the future, come with me to the True Immortal Realm. As long as there are enough Devil Essence Stones, you can cultivate there just the same." Han Li looked at Zi Ling and seemed to have made some decision. His tone was solemn.

Hearing this, Zi Ling fell silent and didn't speak for a time.

Han Li understood her personality and naturally didn't urge her, just quietly waiting.

"Han brother, I've had a question buried in my heart for a long time, and I've always wanted to ask you." After being silent for a moment, Zi Ling suddenly spoke up.

"Go ahead." Han Li was startled, but nodded and said.

"In Han brother's heart, between me and Sister Nangong, who do you care about more?" Zi Ling looked directly into Han Li's eyes, her gaze bright and clear.

"Why would you say that, Zi Ling? You and Wan'er are both the people I care about the most." Hearing this, Han Li was stunned. After a long while, he forced a smile and said.

Zi Ling looked at Han Li. Although his face didn't reveal much, her beautiful eyes still flashed with a hint of disappointment, but she quickly regained her composure.

"You men are truly insatiable, and this has nothing to do with cultivation level." Zi Ling murmured, and then fell silent again.

Han Li continued to look at Zi Ling, and also silently sighed in his heart.

"I've never had the idea of relying on others before, and I won't in the future either. I still want to cultivate on my own like you, and forge my own path. Besides, even though your cultivation is strong, your enemies are not weak either. If I followed by your side, I would only be a burden. It's better for me to stay in the Devil Domain. The environment here suits me better." After a long silence, Zi Ling said.

"You really haven't changed, still exactly the same as before. So what are your plans for the future?" Hearing this, Han Li asked with a bitter smile.

"My aptitude is ordinary, and my cultivation can't compare to yours, Han brother. However, I feel that puppet techniques suit me quite well, so I plan to continue following Sand Heart City Lord and focus on studying puppet techniques. In the future, when Crab Daoist friend is fully resurrected, I should also leave this place and go to the Devil Domain to cultivate." Zi Ling pondered for a moment and said.

"Since you've already made your plans, I won't force you. But take these things. They'll be of great help to your future cultivation." As he spoke, Han Li took out a few jade slips, copying the techniques of the first statue of the "Heavenly Demon Prison Skill," as well as two devil race techniques suitable for Zi Ling's cultivation. He handed them all to Zi Ling.
