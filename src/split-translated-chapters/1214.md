The old man in gray robes was overjoyed and quickly replied, "This tripod, you are from where?"

Han Li asked in a deep voice.

"I report to my senior, this tripod was obtained by me in a relic within the Tian Shang Xian Domain," the old man in gray robes replied respectfully.

"Tian Shang Xian Domain?" Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, as he had never heard of this domain despite his extensive knowledge of the various xian domains.

"It's a small xian domain, and the spiritual energy is sparse, with few resources. The Tian Court has abandoned it, and there is no cross-domain transmission array set up there, so few people know about it. I was being pursued by enemies back then, and I was swallowed by a spatial rift while fleeing, and I accidentally arrived there," the old man in gray robes explained.

"Ah, you're quite frank," Han Li said, glancing at the old man in gray robes.

"I dare not speak falsely to my senior," the old man in gray robes said, lowering his head.

"I saw the name 'Yan Luo Zhi Fu' on the tripod's inscription, do you know this place?" Han Li asked, his eyes narrowing.

He had been paying attention to the old man in gray robes and his companions, even going so far as to consume his own energy to use the "True Word Transcendence Technique" to forcibly take control of the tripod. The reason for this was the four characters "Yan Luo Zhi Fu" on the tripod.

Since his last journey through time and space, he had been searching for information about Yan Luo Zhi Fu, but unfortunately, he had found nothing.

Today, he had finally found a lead, and he was not about to let it slip away.

"Yan Luo Zhi Fu? I've never heard of this name, perhaps it's a place in the Tian Shang Xian Domain. It's said to be near the Nine Underworlds, and there are many places with the name 'Yan Luo'," the old man in gray robes said.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed as he listened, and he glanced at Qi Huan.

Qi Huan nodded slightly.

"You're answering honestly, I'll keep my promise and spare your life for now. You can stay here for the time being, and after some time, take me to the Tian Shang Xian Domain. When the time comes, I'll let you go," Han Li said.

The old man in gray robes was overjoyed and quickly agreed.

Han Li waved his hand, and the old man in gray robes' eyes turned black as he fell to the ground, unconscious.

Han Li didn't bother with him anymore and looked around the dark red space, his gaze finally falling on the six stone stele surrounding the plaza.

"These stone stele are quite extraordinary, containing a strange and ancient power. I wonder what kind of law it is that can revive the dead?" Qi Huan's beautiful eyes sparkled with interest.

"Although there are three thousand great dao, in reality, there are countless laws in the world. How can we possibly know them all? You mentioned earlier that one of the Sun family members was interesting, was it Sun Zhongshan?" Han Li sighed and changed the subject.

"No, I meant her," Qi Huan pointed to a woman in red robes standing nearby.

Han Li followed Qi Huan's pointing finger and was taken aback.

"Her spirit and soul are completely different from those of a normal person, containing a strange and ancient death energy. Now I know, it's because of these six stone stele," Qi Huan continued.

"This treasure has a yin-cold attribute, which isn't suitable for me. You can take control of it. Since you're interested in this place, research it thoroughly, and also keep an eye on Sun Zhongshan," Han Li said, his eyes not showing any interest.

He waved his hand, and a dark red light enveloped Qi Huan's body.

"Thank you, Master, for the treasure," Qi Huan was overjoyed and quickly bowed in gratitude.

Han Li didn't stay any longer and left the area, returning to his residence without meeting with Yu Meng Han again.

Qi Huan also returned to her residence and sat down next to Han Li, researching the tripod.

Outside, the golden wind continued to blow, but the Day and Night Divine Vessel had already passed the most difficult period and was moving forward at a faster pace.

About half a month later, the Day and Night Divine Vessel finally passed through the golden wind disaster and returned to its original speed, continuing towards the Nine Yuan City.

Ten years passed quickly, and the Day and Night Divine Vessel finally arrived at the Nine Yuan City.

Han Li stood in front of the window, looking at the giant city in the distance. Despite having seen many magnificent cities and regions, he was still shocked.

The Nine Yuan City gave him the first impression of being incredibly tall, with city walls that stretched up to several tens of thousands of feet, rivaling the nearby towering peaks. The city walls seemed to be a natural barrier, blocking the view, and the entire city was like a massive beast, sprawling across the land.

The second impression was of its vastness, as the Nine Yuan City's area was boundless, stretching beyond his line of sight. The city walls continued to stretch out, engulfing the surrounding mountains.

The city's streets were countless, with people flowing like a river, and the city's aura was dense, with a profusion of spiritual energy.

Han Li took a deep breath and withdrew his gaze, sitting down in a cross-legged position.

The Day and Night Divine Vessel descended from the sky and landed in the city.

Half an hour later, Han Li walked out of a high tower in the city, blending in with the crowd.

The high tower was filled with people, and a white-robed nun, Yu Meng Han, walked out quickly, looking around as if searching for someone. She didn't find anyone and showed a disappointed expression, standing still for a moment before walking away.

Han Li walked quickly through the streets, his movements swift and confident.

Although he was visiting the Nine Yuan City for the first time, he moved with ease, without any hesitation.

Jiao San had informed him of the city's situation and the location of his lodgings.
The streets were lined with tall and grand shops, selling all sorts of goods, including magical artifacts, elixirs, and materials. It seemed that the city was even more prosperous than the Golden City.

The city was bustling with activity, as if preparing for a grand festival. Many shops were decorating their storefronts.

Han Li's eyes flickered, but he didn't stop to investigate. He continued to walk quickly forward.

This was the territory of the Jiu Yuan Sect, and although he didn't feel like he was being watched, he couldn't shake the feeling that there were many eyes monitoring the city.

According to the information he had received from Jiao San, the safest place to stay was the designated location. He had to be extremely cautious when going anywhere else.

After half a day, Han Li arrived at a small alley on the outskirts of the city. The alley had a small inn, but the door was closed.

He carefully examined the inn's front door, especially the stone lion at the entrance. A hint of a smile flashed in his eyes as he walked up to the door and knocked in a rhythmic pattern.

"Who is it?" a lazy voice replied from inside. The door didn't open.

"Shopkeeper, do you have any available rooms? I'd like to stay here," Han Li said, still knocking on the door.

The door remained silent for a moment, and only opened after Han Li stopped knocking.

"Do you want to stay?" a young boy in a short shirt asked, looking Han Li up and down.

"Yes, I've come to Jiu Yuan City to do some business. I need to stay for half a year," Han Li said, using the pre-arranged code phrase.

"Ah, please come in," the boy said, his eyes lighting up as he stepped aside to let Han Li in. He immediately closed the door behind him.

Han Li's eyes flickered as he stepped into the courtyard. It seemed that the inn was surrounded by a special barrier, and the pressure in the air dissipated significantly.

He felt a sense of relief as he followed the boy to a room in the inn. A middle-aged man with a rich appearance was sitting at a desk, calculating accounts. He looked up as he heard footsteps.

"Shopkeeper, this guest wants to stay," the boy said.

"May I ask your name, sir? How long do you plan to stay?" the shopkeeper asked, waving his hand for the boy to leave. He closed the door and asked in a cold tone.

"I'm Han Li. I plan to stay for half a year," Han Li replied, taking out a red mask and flashing it briefly before putting it away.

These were the pre-arranged code phrases.

"Ah, welcome, Senior Han. Jiao San has already instructed me to let you stay here," the shopkeeper said with a smile, his tone somewhat flattering.

"Is Jiao San here?" Han Li asked.

"Jiao San is not here at the moment, but she has sent a message saying that you can stay here safely. She will come to meet you soon to discuss the details of your task," the shopkeeper said.

"I'll wait a bit longer," Han Li said, his brow furrowed for a moment before relaxing.

"Please follow me, Senior Han," the shopkeeper said, leading Han Li to the inner courtyard.

They walked through several turns, arriving at a small, clean, and tidy courtyard with a blue-tiled roof.

Han Li nodded in satisfaction.

"Senior Han, you must be tired from your journey. Please rest. If you need anything, just ring the small bell in the courtyard. I'll take my leave," the shopkeeper said, bowing.

"Wait, I have something to ask you," Han Li said, stopping the shopkeeper.

"Please, Senior Han, ask me anything. I'll do my best to answer," the shopkeeper said, looking slightly surprised.

"I noticed that the city was decorated with lanterns and streamers when I arrived. What's going on?" Han Li asked.

"Didn't you know, Senior Han? The Heavenly Court's messenger is about to arrive at Jiu Yuan Sect to issue the thirty-six invitations to the Bodhi Banquet. The city is preparing for the event," the shopkeeper said, looking somewhat astonished.

"Ah, I didn't know. I've been busy with my cultivation and haven't heard about this. I know about the Bodhi Banquet, but what's the significance of the thirty-six invitations?" Han Li asked.

"The Bodhi Banquet is the most important event in the Heavenly Court. All the major sects in the True Immortal Realm want to attend, but the Heavenly Court only issues a limited number of invitations. Before the Bodhi Banquet, the Heavenly Court will issue invitations to the major sects, and then the internal forces of the sects will compete for the invitations. The same is true for the Da Jin Yuan Sect. This time, the Heavenly Court has issued thirty-six invitations to the Da Jin Yuan Sect, and all the major forces in the sect will gather in Jiu Yuan City to compete for the invitations," the shopkeeper explained.

"I see. When will the Heavenly Court's messenger arrive in Jiu Yuan City?" Han Li asked.

"I don't know exactly, but it should be soon," the shopkeeper said.

Han Li nodded, asking a few more questions about the competition for the invitations. He then dismissed the shopkeeper.

He entered the room, habitually setting up several layers of barriers around him. He sat down, looking thoughtful.

Jiao San had told him to arrive in Jiu Yuan City within thirty years, which coincided with the time the Heavenly Court's messenger would arrive. The task from the Wheel of Reincarnation was likely related to the competition for the Bodhi Banquet invitations.

Han Li shook his head, deciding not to think about it anymore. He looked towards the depths of Jiu Yuan City.

"Jin Tong, I'll wait for you. I'll definitely rescue you," he thought to himself, before closing his eyes and sitting in meditation.
