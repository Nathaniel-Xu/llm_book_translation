"It's no wonder that the Wheel of Rebirth Palace's highest-grade divine mask is so extraordinary. With this kind of transformation, it's almost as if I'm the real deal." Chang Qi couldn't help but exclaim.

"Marvelous, marvelous... with this, even many of the elders of the Xianyun Sect wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the real and fake." Zhou Xianyang clapped his hands in admiration.

"Next, I hope you'll share with me the unique aspects of your cultivation method." Han Li asked Chang Qi.

Since he was skilled at disguising himself to avoid trouble, Han Li's movements and demeanor changed as he spoke, making him seem almost identical to Chang Qi. Zhou Xianyang and the others were full of praise.

"Of course." Chang Qi nodded.

"I'll go collect some information on the participating sects for this selection. You two can discuss the details here." Zhou Xianyang said, before leaving.

The room was left with only the sound of Han Li and Chang Qi's discussion.

...

A month passed quickly.

On this day, the entire city of Jiuyuan was empty, with almost everyone gathered at the foot of Jiuyuan Mountain.

The selection for the Bodhi banquet was being held at the mountain gate of Jiuyuan Temple.

Han Li had already changed his appearance and was disguised as Chang Qi, following Zhou Xianyang and several elders of the Xianyun Sect to Jiuyuan Mountain.

Along the way, Han Li was quiet but occasionally exchanged a few words with the Xianyun Sect elders.

Although he was pretending to be Chang Qi, who was rarely seen by others, he still had a few acquaintances among the elders.

However, Han Li responded with ease, and his movements were so natural that he didn't reveal his true identity.

The group arrived at the foot of Jiuyuan Mountain, and from afar, they saw a towering mountain range that pierced the clouds.

The mountain range stretched far and wide, with lush greenery and a thick layer of fog covering the upper half. A majestic cloud sea array protected the mountain, with colors flowing and swirling within.

Near the mountain gate, a waterfall cascaded down, and a rainbow hung in the air. The sound of cranes and monkeys could be heard, and the air was filled with the scent of immortals.

In front of the mountain gate, a massive square had been built, with many areas divided and a series of high platforms erected for the martial arts competition.

The area outside the platforms was divided by arrays, and thousands of people had gathered to watch. From the ground to the air, the crowd was dense and uncountable.

Han Li and the others followed the path and arrived at the mountain gate, where they were greeted by a massive semicircular stone platform.

A three-story, twelve-sided pagoda stood tall at the gate, unlike the ordinary pagodas in the mortal world. It was made of spirit jade, resembling a massive piece of green jade.

A white jade plaque hung above the pagoda, with the words "Jiuyuan Shengjing" written in ancient script.

Han Li looked through the pagoda and saw a winding stone path leading up to a misty area, where the scenery was hidden from view.

On the semicircular platform, Han Li saw rows of seats, densely packed and facing the platforms. They were led by the Jiuyuan Temple disciples to a seat on the left side, not far from the center.

Zhou Xianyang greeted several familiar sect leaders, then sat down, followed by the others.

"Rumor has it that the Xianyun Sect's Chang Qi, who has been traveling outside, has returned. I've never had the chance to meet him before. Could you introduce him to me?" A white-haired old man asked, looking at the Xianyun Sect group.

Han Li had already reviewed the information Zhou Xianyang had collected and recognized the old man as Zhao Yuancai, the master of Wujishan. His nephew, Zhao Bolao, was also present, a Taiyi period cultivator with ice attribute abilities.

"Chang, since Master Zhao wants to meet you, come and pay your respects." Zhou Xianyang said with a smile.

Han Li bowed and said, "I've met Master Zhao."

Zhao Yuancai sized Han Li up, then exchanged a glance with a slender, pale-faced young man in white robes, who was standing behind him. They seemed to be communicating silently.

Han Li knew this young man was Zhao Bolao, and they exchanged a nod.

"Your inner energy is compact, and your aura is stable. No wonder Master Zhou has been keeping you hidden. With your presence, the Xianyun Sect is sure to win the Bodhi banquet." Zhao Yuancai said, nodding his head.

Han Li could sense that Zhao Yuancai was trying to hide his true intentions, but he was actually looking down on him.

Zhou Xianyang noticed this and smiled to himself, thinking that if Zhao Bolao were to encounter his "Chang Qi", it would be a good show.

As they exchanged pleasantries, a man in a green bamboo-patterned robe, followed by several elegant women in white robes, walked onto the platform and headed towards another seat.

Han Li's eyes followed the man, and he saw that it was a cultivator from the Qingyun Sect, who was said to be a master of the wind attribute.
As soon as this person arrived, Zhou Xianyang's face sank, and a flash of anger appeared in his eyes.

Zhao Yuanlai also followed his gaze, and his face also changed slightly, revealing a hint of disgust.

"Si Kongjian, this scoundrel, always pretends to be a humble gentleman, but who in the Golden Source Immortal Domain doesn't know that he's a hypocrite?" Zhao Yuanlai said loudly, without lowering his voice.

Han Li also looked over, and saw Si Kongjian holding a cup of tea, presented to him by a woman beside him. Si Kongjian seemed to have heard Zhao Yuanlai's words, and his eyes narrowed slightly as he looked over.

His appearance was indeed worthy of the four words "handsome and elegant", and his eyebrows rose slightly as he revealed a hint of a smile, a challenge to Zhao Yuanlai and Zhou Xianyang.

"This scoundrel, why didn't he bring his great disciple, and not even the elder of the isolated Yang Peak? He only brought some female disciples?" Zhao Yuanlai wondered.

"Don't guess, this old scoundrel is probably willing to sacrifice his dignity, thinking that he can personally participate in the selection and compete with the younger generation." Zhou Xianyang said, without surprise, glancing over at Si Kongjian.

"This..." Zhao Yuanlai heard this, and was slightly shocked.

As the head of a sect, personally participating in the selection was not impossible, but it was not common for the sect leaders to do so, as it would affect the sect's reputation. If they lost, it would be a loss of face for the entire sect.

"Boom..."

As the two were talking, a loud bell rang out from the Nine Yuan Immortal Domain's mountain gate.

The sound of the bell echoed through the mountains, and a cloud of colorful clouds floated over, passing over the high jade plaque pavilion, and landing on the circular stone platform.

The stone platform flashed with a radiant light, and five figures appeared.

The sect leaders who were participating in the selection stood up, adjusted their clothes, and bowed to the five figures.

Han Li also bowed, but his eyes were observing the five figures.

The person in the center, wearing a golden crown, and dressed in heavenly official attire, was the messenger from the Heavenly Court, who had come from the Middle Earth Immortal Domain.

On his left was a person wearing a dark green robe, and a lotus flower crown, who was the master of the Nine Yuan Immortal Domain, Chun Jun.

On his right was a person of average height, with a ordinary face, and a warm smile, who was the master of the Golden Source Immortal Palace, Lu Chuanfeng.

On either side of these two, were two people who Han Li had never seen before, but had heard of from Zhou Xianyang.

One was a purple-robed old man, with a pale face, and a swollen body, who looked tired and sluggish, and was the master of the Day and Night Alliance, Tian Xing.

The other was a tall, black-haired young man, with a high forehead, and a white lock of hair, who looked elegant and refined, and was the master of the Hundred Creations Mountain, Huo Yuan.

According to what Jing Yang had said, Huo Yuan was already the fifth generation master of the Hundred Creations Mountain.

As the five figures appeared, the square erupted in a loud cheer.

Chun Jun walked forward, and raised his hand to silence the crowd, and the square quickly quieted down.

Then, he walked back, and spoke with the Heavenly Court messenger, before arranging the people to sit down.

"Coinciding with the Bodhi Festival, we have received the Heavenly Court's great favor, and wish to share it with the cultivators of the Golden Source Immortal Domain, and have therefore decided to announce the Twelve Bodhi Edicts, to be transmitted to the various great sects, and give the cultivators the opportunity to participate in the Bodhi Festival, and enjoy the Bodhi fruit." Chun Jun said loudly, facing the crowd.

The crowd was overjoyed, and it seemed as if they had already received the Heavenly Court's favor.

"Heavenly favor, benefiting all living beings..."

"Heavenly favor, benefiting all living beings..."

The crowd began to chant, and the square was filled with a wave of sound.

The Heavenly Court messenger seemed pleased, and smiled slightly.

The people beside him, except for Tian Xing, who was sleeping, were all smiling.

At this time, a Nine Yuan Immortal Domain elder, who was responsible for hosting the competition, walked forward, and said:

"Our Golden Source Immortal Domain is vast, and has many sects, but the Bodhi Edicts are limited, and only twelve will be given out. It will depend on the strength of the various sects to see who will receive them."

"The Heavenly Court's gift, we must do our best." The ninety-six sect leaders stood up, and bowed.

"Earlier, each sect had submitted their list of participants, and now, please have the cultivators who are participating in the competition come forward, and draw lots for the first round." The elder said loudly.

Han Li heard this, and looked at Zhou Xianyang, before walking forward, and standing beside Zhao Yuanlai.

At the same time, the other sects' participants also walked forward, and gathered at the front.
