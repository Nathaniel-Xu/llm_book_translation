The Zhenyan Treasure Wheel's surface suddenly lit up with a brilliant light, as if a multitude of Dao patterns had emerged, fluttering and dancing in the air. The wheel itself detached from Han Li's back and flew upwards, suspended in mid-air like a full moon, its golden light radiating downwards.

The golden hourglass followed, falling to the ground and releasing its golden sand, which slowly poured out, spreading rapidly and covering the ground. In the blink of an eye, it had reached Qimozi's feet.

Qimozi's eyes widened in shock, his raised foot hesitating for a moment before he violently stomped into the sand, feeling a slight delay before continuing his advance towards Han Li.

However, just as he was about to reach Han Li, the other three time law manifestation objects began to change.

The golden liquid in the Guangyin Vessel transformed into a long, golden river, flowing and swirling in the air. The Dongyi Divine Tree was planted in the golden sand, condensing into a forest of virtual shadows. The golden torch flew into the sky, dispersing into countless sparks, resembling the starry night sky.

"This is... could it be?"

Qimozi's eyes flashed with shock, his footsteps stopping as he gazed at the scene before him.

Even Han Li himself was surprised by the sudden appearance of this strange and wondrous scene. The five time law manifestation objects had merged with his time domain, creating a fantastical landscape.

Han Li's domain space changed, causing the time law fluctuations within the domain to intensify, as if the golden ripples were resisting Qimozi's disrupted flow of time. However, the difference in their cultivation realms was too great, and Qimozi maintained the upper hand.

"Good! You've indeed obtained the Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique, and you've already reached the point of resonating with the domain. This time, you won't be able to escape, and I will definitely obtain this technique!" Qimozi's face, which had initially been shocked, was now filled with an indescribable excitement.

As he spoke, he activated the golden torch, summoning a brilliant light, and retrieved the black short axe, striking down towards Han Li.

Han Li had no choice but to use his Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique and the Tianxia Zhenjin Technique to their limits, preparing to ignite his true spirit blood vessels and transform into a three-headed, six-armed form to withstand the attack.

But just as he was about to do so, a sudden change occurred!

The five time law manifestation objects on the surface suddenly emitted a brilliant light, as if time law crystals were shooting out, merging and fusing in the air, releasing a dazzling five-colored light.

Qimozi felt the five-colored light enveloping him, his expression changing as he became frozen in place, unable to move.

Han Li's eyes flashed with surprise as he saw the five-colored light illuminating Qimozi's body, causing his form to begin to blur and split into multiple virtual shadows.

However, as the shadows continued to divide, the first virtual shadow began to shine with a faint light, its body dissolving into a gray mist, dispersing into the air.

As the shadows continued to disappear, the real Qimozi's body began to undergo a subtle transformation, his aura changing as well.

Han Li was unaware of the fortunate coincidence that had created this strange scene, and he feared that any careless movement would disrupt the scene before him.

So, he carefully maintained his technique, focusing all his energy on the Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique.

However, his eyes never left Qimozi's body.

After observing for a moment, Han Li discovered that as the virtual shadows disappeared, Qimozi's cultivation was gradually weakening... or rather, his age was decreasing.

The virtual shadows seemed to be the countless years Qimozi had experienced, and as they dissipated under the five-colored light, he was being pulled into a time trap, his body regressing to a state from tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of years ago.

Within a dozen breaths, Qimozi's aura had plummeted, and he was unable to maintain even the early stages of the Mahayana realm, his state becoming increasingly unstable.

"How is this possible? These are just illusions, how can they have such power?" Qimozi struggled desperately, but to no avail, and he cried out in shock.

Han Li gritted his teeth, pouring all his energy into the technique.

He believed that if he could just hold on for a few more breaths, Qimozi's body would regress even further, perhaps to the point where he could no longer maintain his cultivation, and Han Li would have a chance to defeat him.

But fate was not on his side. The five-colored light above Qimozi's head began to fade, its color becoming increasingly dull, as if its energy was being rapidly depleted, and it was on the verge of collapse.
"Hold on a bit longer, just a bit longer..." Han Li's eyebrows were scrunched up into a knot, his heart constantly praying.

But in the next instant, a faint "plop" sound echoed out.

The five-colored fusion light, under intense consumption, finally lost all its color, and all the time crystal threads within it had exhausted all their time law power, transforming into thin, transparent silk threads.

Immediately after, the spiritual domain's round moon descended, the stars gathered, the mountains flattened, the rivers flowed backwards, the trees disappeared, and all the illusory landscapes that had been conjured up dissipated.

Then, the five time law incarnations reappeared, each one's light dimly flying into Han Li's body, and no matter how he called out, they couldn't be externalized.

Not waiting for Qimozi to react, Han Li let out a loud roar, circulating the Tian Xiao Zhen Yu (Heavenly Executioner's Imprisonment) technique while reversing the true spirit blood vessels in his body. A crimson light burst forth, and his body suddenly expanded, transforming into a three-headed, six-armed form in an instant.

The central giant ape's head glared, its eyes flashing, as it swung a massive fist at Qimozi, followed by a dragon claw covered in golden scales that shot out, grasping at him.

The latter had just regained his freedom, but he didn't care about his realm decreasing, and hastily raised his hand to perform a strange hand seal, then pushed out a palm. The golden fire on the golden fire torch suddenly surged upwards.

A golden flame dragon formed, charging straight at Han Li.

The flame dragon's body condensed a dense time law power, moving at an unfathomable speed that surpassed Han Li's giant fist and dragon claw, striking him first.

Wherever the flame dragon passed, the void's time momentarily froze, its power not inferior to Han Li's when he was in the Da Luo realm. If Han Li was hit, his body would definitely become stuck, unable to fight back.

However, Han Li had long been prepared for this situation. The moment the golden flame dragon appeared, a green light burst forth in front of him, and the Xuan Tian Gourd (Mysterious Heaven Gourd) had opened its mouth, waiting.

The gourd's mouth was spinning rapidly with a green light, but when the golden flame dragon approached, it slowed down, yet never truly stopped.

When the golden flame dragon drew near, it was inevitably sucked in, directly swallowed by the gourd.

The gourd violently shook, its mouth self-sealing, its body still trembling non-stop.

Han Li had no time to care about the gourd's abnormality, and immediately grasped this fleeting opportunity, swinging out a fist and a claw simultaneously. The star power within him also surged out without restraint.

Qimozi, under the influence of the five-colored fusion light, was originally unstable, and having just used a secret technique, was caught off guard by Han Li's sudden absorption of the attack into the gourd. He was unable to counterattack, and was struck by a massive force that was like a mountain range crashing down.

A loud "boom" echoed out!

A burst of starlight exploded, and Qimozi's figure was struck, flying out amidst the starlight fragments.

His bones crackled, and he spat out a mouthful of blood, his eyes still fixed on Han Li with hatred, until he flew out of the black night sky that the Wuguo Ghost King had shrouded, and heavily crashed to the ground.

Han Li's body leapt forward, chasing after him, but the latter flashed away, shooting towards the distance and disappearing in an instant.

The ten Red Robed Ghost Generals and the Tian Shui Sect disciples, who were fighting in the distance, didn't even see his figure, only seeing the torn black night sky slowly closing, with a faint three-headed, six-armed giant demon silhouette visible inside.

Han Li's gaze slowly returned from the distance, his mind stirring slightly. The thirty-six Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Swords and the Jing Yan Fire Bird, which had been sealed by the Broken Time Flowing Fire, flew back to his side.

He turned his gaze to the other side, and saw that Ti Hu and the Wuguo Ghost King were still fighting, their bodies covered in shocking wounds, seemingly at a disadvantage.

The Wuguo Ghost King had already transformed into a several hundred zhang tall giant ghost, wearing a blood-red armor, with a crimson cloak draped over it, its entire body a deep red color.

Its head had sharp horns, its mouth had fangs, and its face was twisted with ferocity. When it breathed, two streams of blood mist flowed out of its nostrils, its body emitting a powerful, bloody aura that made one want to vomit.

The Wuguo Ghost King grasped a massive white bone trident, its shaft inscribed with blood-red symbols, its tip wrapped in black smoke, stabbing straight at Ti Hu's brow.

Ti Hu's brow was filled with a surging blood light, which collided with the Wuguo Ghost King's attack, splashing out a large amount of blood light.

"Go!"

Han Li's palm swung out, and the thirty-six Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Swords flew out first, shining with countless sword lights, like a golden sword rain pouring down from the sky, fiercely chopping towards the Wuguo Ghost King.
