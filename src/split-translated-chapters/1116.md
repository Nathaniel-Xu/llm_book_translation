Qí Mó Zǐ faced the Eagle-Nosed Demon's stern questioning, but simply laughed loudly, not responding, and with a flick of his hands, he made a seal.

The spiritual realm's golden light surged and converged above the Eagle-Nosed Demon's head, transforming into a several-dozen-zhang-tall golden figure.

This figure's lower body was a dragon, while its upper body was a middle-aged man with a thick, golden beard, and its chest was covered in dense, golden fur. It held a fire fan in its hand, and its face seemed to radiate endless majesty.

The middle-aged man's large hand stretched out, grabbing downwards towards the Eagle-Nosed Demon and his companions.

A thunderous sound echoed, and a massive pressure descended from the sky, crushing the three demons. They were like ants under the weight of a giant peak, unable to move or make a sound.

"I went to great lengths to lure you here, intending to capture you all at once. However, something unexpected happened, and two of you escaped. Still, the three of you will suffice."

Qí Mó Zǐ chuckled and raised his hand, and a blood-red staff flew out from behind him. The staff was adorned with a nine-headed demon dragon, seven of which emitted dazzling, blood-red light, while the remaining two were dim and unlit.

As the staff appeared, the surrounding air grew dark, and the sound of wailing ghosts filled the air. A chilling, blood-red energy emanated from the staff, which even the nearby spiritual realm couldn't block.

Qí Mó Zǐ muttered to himself, making a seal with his hand.

The staff emitted a blood-red light, enveloping the three demons. A blood-red energy burst forth from their bodies, merging with the staff, and the three demons' bodies rapidly withered away. The two dimly lit demon dragon heads on the staff began to shine with bright, blood-red light.

Meanwhile, Hàn Lì burst through the five-colored light curtain and swiftly entered the realm within. He raised his arm, and a piercing sword cry echoed through the air as a golden giant sword flew out, transforming into a golden sword rainbow that shot towards the yellow jade pillar.

"You dare to steal from me? You're seeking death!" Dào Yìn Zhēn Rén roared, pointing his hand at the golden talisman.

The talisman's divine lamp pattern flashed, shooting out a thick, golden light. The divine lamp pattern dimmed, and the temporal law fluctuations weakened.

The golden light merged with the Time God's Lamp, and the lamp's flame surged once more. Two golden flames shot out, and one of them transformed into a five-clawed golden dragon. The dragon's body was covered in golden armor, and its surface displayed intricate, temporal law patterns. It was several times more solid than the previous golden dragon.

The golden dragon charged forward, its speed incredible, and reached the yellow jade pillar before the golden giant sword. It swiped its claws, and a blinding golden light erupted as the two massive temporal law forces collided. The surrounding void reverberated with the sound of thunder.

The golden giant sword was halted by the dragon's claws, and then the dragon coiled its body around the sword, spewing out a stream of golden flames that fiercely struck the sword. The sword's surface glowed with intense golden light, and it began to melt at an alarming rate.

The other golden flame shot towards the five-colored altar, unfolding into a golden flame curtain that blocked the altar from view.

Hàn Lì's eyebrows rose slightly as he observed the scene, his body frozen in place.

Dào Yìn Zhēn Rén let out a sigh of relief, his eyes gleaming with a killing intent as he gazed at Hàn Lì. "You're overestimating yourself. You'll die!"

He raised his hand, and a dazzling white light shot out, striking Hàn Lì with incredible speed. The distance between them was short, and the white light seemed to appear instantly, covering Hàn Lì's body.

Hàn Lì's body glowed with a crystalline light as the True Extreme Membrane emerged, his arms crossing to defend himself. Simultaneously, his body flashed with golden lightning, and eight or nine bamboo swords flew out, weaving together into a golden sword curtain.

Since this place was near the Time God's Lamp, the spiritual realm's effects were nullified, and Hàn Lì couldn't be certain if his divine abilities would work. With time pressing, he had no choice but to rely on these defensive measures.

Before Hàn Lì could unleash more swords, the white light struck, shattering the golden sword curtain. The light continued to fly towards Hàn Lì, slamming into his crossed arms.

A deafening crash echoed through the air, and Hàn Lì's body was sent flying like a straw, crashing into the five-colored light curtain before finally coming to a stop.

His arms throbbed with pain, and his bones seemed to crack. He hastily activated the "Heavenly Execution, Prison Purification" technique, and the pain began to subside.

However, a white light erupted before his eyes once more, and the light, like a swift, deadly insect, shot towards him. The light was even brighter than before, and its intensity seemed to have increased.
Han Li's heart skipped a beat, and his footsteps faltered as he hastily retreated to the side. At the same time, he swept his sleeve, and a ball of emerald-green light burst forth from his sleeve, enveloping the white light.

The white light was slowed down by the emerald-green light, and its radiance dimmed significantly. However, in the next instant, it suddenly burst forth with a myriad of steel needles-like fierce white light, tearing apart the emerald-green light and continuing to charge towards Han Li.

Han Li's pupils constricted, and he took advantage of this brief momentary gap!

He let out a loud shout, and the lightning-like radiance on his body flashed wildly. Thirty-six stalks of green bamboo flew out from his body, transforming into rays of lightning that entwined and killed the white light.

At the same time, he pinched his fingers together, and a golden light flashed on his body. His body suddenly grew several times larger, and golden fur sprouted from his skin, transforming him into a golden giant ape in an instant.

A series of deafening metallic clashes erupted, and the thirty-six stalks of green bamboo struck the white light, causing it to quiver violently.

The giant ape let out a loud roar, and its two arms struck out with immense force, its fists bursting with golden light that smashed onto the white light.

A thunderous boom shook the air!

The white light was finally forced back, and the golden giant ape stumbled backward, its fists covered in blood and flesh, as if they had been shattered by more than half.

At this moment, Han Li finally saw the true form of the white light, which was a small white sword.

The sword's design was somewhat peculiar, several times thicker than ordinary flying swords. The sword's tip and blade were dull and flat, looking ancient and strange, but it emitted an astonishing amount of law and spiritual energy, rivaling the five artifacts within the Five Elements Sealing Array.

As Han Li pondered, his body's spiritual energy surged wildly, and his injured hands rapidly recovered.

Meanwhile, Dao Yin's eyes widened in surprise, and he felt a sense of urgency, intending to use the white sword to heavily injure or kill Han Li once more.

Just as he was about to do so, two sharp whistles pierced the air, and two figures emerged from the gap in the light screen that Han Li had created. It was Jiao San and Hu San, who immediately charged towards the Five-Colored Altar.

Dao Yin's expression changed, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of panic. He no longer cared about conserving his spiritual energy and waved his hand.

A golden light burst forth from his body, expanding rapidly to form a golden spiritual domain that enveloped Han Li and the others.

A vast and powerful golden law emanated from within, far surpassing the law that Han Li and the others possessed. Before it could even touch them, the spiritual light on their bodies was already suppressed and dispersed.

Hu San's figure suddenly halted, and he flipped his hand to reveal the Heaven Fox Blood Knife. The gray-white light on his body surged, and a thunderous boom shook the air as a gray-white spiritual domain expanded.

He let out a low growl, and the gray-white spiritual domain rapidly contracted, transforming into a fist-sized gray-white light sphere.

The light sphere's gray-white crystal radiance surged wildly, and its powerful law energy fluctuations could be felt from a distance. In an instant, it merged with the Heaven Fox Blood Knife.

The Heaven Fox Blood Knife let out a soft hum, and the double-headed fox carvings on its blade emitted a layer of blood-red light. One of the four eyes on the carvings suddenly flashed with bright red light.

The Heaven Fox Blood Knife violently shook, emitting a thunderous knife cry as if it had finally awakened from a long slumber. A boundless power burst forth from within, and the knife's body radiated a blood-red glow that dyed everything within the light screen a deep crimson.

The figure of Shi Qing Hou appeared in the blood-red light, his hands pinching a spell that refused to stop. Countless blood-red talismans burst forth from the knife's body, swarming around him.

Hu San's eyes turned blood-red, and he let out a deafening roar, his hands holding the knife as he struck out with a single slash!

A blood-red light wave shot forth, containing an extremely powerful law energy that rivaled the golden spiritual domain. The wave crashed onto the golden spiritual domain, causing Shi Qing Hou's figure to suddenly expand to over a hundred meters tall. His hands burst forth with dazzling blood-red light, pressing down on the golden spiritual domain.

The golden spiritual domain's expansion was abruptly halted, unable to advance even a single step.

As the knife struck out, Hu San's face turned deathly pale, and his body lost all its gray-white light. He had clearly exhausted his spiritual energy.

He knelt on the ground, his hand trembling as he held the knife.

"What?!" Dao Yin's expression changed, and he let out a shout, waving his hand.

A white light shot forth, and the white sword suddenly grew to several dozen meters in size, transforming into a massive white sword that swept towards the three of them.

But just as it was about to strike, Han Li's figure appeared in front of the white sword, having transformed back into his human form.

He pinched his fingers together, and the golden giant sword that had been entwined with the golden fire dragon suddenly exploded, transforming into a golden sun that sent the golden fire dragon flying.

Over two hundred law crystals burst forth from the golden sun, disappearing and reappearing beside Han Li.

He muttered to himself, his hands pinching a spell as he waved them.

The two hundred law crystals intertwined and wrapped around each other, transforming into a golden giant sword that radiated a dazzling golden light. It stood before the white sword, ready to block its attack.
