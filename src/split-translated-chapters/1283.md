Here is the translation:

“Now that the great one has returned, as long as we gather the scattered followers and rest for a few tens of thousands of years, we will definitely have the opportunity to avenge ourselves against the Turning Wheel King.” Yin Luo said with a bow.

“Tens of thousands of years is too long, I only want to fight for a day or two. Besides, there is also an opportunity now.” Xue Li said coldly.

“What do you mean, great one?” Yin Luo asked in confusion.

“Did you notice anyone familiar among the people you were chasing earlier?” Xue Li asked.

Yin Luo's brow furrowed as he thought, and his face turned solemn.

“That black-clad girl, her divine abilities are somewhat... similar to the Underworld King!” he exclaimed after a moment.

“Correct, I am 90% certain that she is the reincarnation of the Underworld King. To defeat the Turning Wheel King and reclaim the Underworld, we must awaken her memories and cooperate with her.” Xue Li said.

“If that's the case, should we stop chasing them?” Yin Luo asked.

“There's no need to chase them, but we can't lose track of them either.” Xue Li said slowly.

“Yes, sir. I will send someone to track them down.” Yin Luo stood up, bowed, and said.

“This matter is left to you to handle. My old wounds have not yet healed, and I must close my eyes and cultivate for a while.” Xue Li said, and then his body suddenly rose into the air, flying high into the sky and disappearing in an instant.

...

In front of the heavy and gloomy mountain range, a winding river flowed with a deep red color, its waters murky and turbid.

The river flowed from the mountain valley, winding its way for thousands of miles until it reached this place, where the water's momentum slowed, and it deposited a vast expanse of white sandy beach.

At this time, three figures fell from the sky, landing on the beach. It was Han Li and the others.

“Uncle, it seems those people didn't catch up to us.” Jin Tong said, looking back.

Han Li also looked back, and then turned to Xi Huang, asking with his eyes.

“I also don't sense any pursuers for now, we should have shaken them off by a bit of distance.” Xi Huang said.

Han Li nodded, took a deep breath, and looked around.

As he looked, his brow furrowed.

The white sandy beach beneath their feet was covered in a dense layer of white bones, both human and beast. They were piled high, some as large as a canopy, others as small as insects.

Han Li bent down, pushed aside the layers of dry bones, and scooped up a handful of white sand. He lightly rubbed it, and fine white powder fell from his fingertips, which were actually bone powder.

“So many white bones, I wonder where they came from?” Xi Huang asked in puzzlement.

“They should have been washed down from the river upstream, accumulating over countless years, and the bones beneath have completely rotted away, turning into bone powder.” Han Li said.

As they spoke, a strange whirlwind blew from the river upstream, lifting the bone powder into the air like sand, and amidst the powder, there were tiny, glowing green sparks.

The three of them were shocked, and suddenly heard a strange noise.

They saw a green flame rising from the deep red river, drifting downstream.

Han Li and the others were puzzled, and as they approached the riverbank, they saw that the twisting green flame seemed to be floating a blurry human face, which was smiling at them with an eerie grin.

“What kind of ghostly thing is this?” Jin Tong asked in confusion.

Xi Huang scrunched up her nose, as if she was about to release a burst of energy to absorb it.

“Don't be hasty, it seems to have something to say.” Han Li said, holding out his hand to stop them.

As soon as he spoke, the green flame began to speak in a weak, broken voice:

“Go... to... the river... valley...”

The voice was like the final gasp of a dying person, and it only spoke once before falling silent.

The green flame then sank into the water, disappearing without a trace.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he looked towards the mountain range upstream.

The sky above was dark and foreboding, with clouds that seemed to press down on the mountain peaks, making the black mountains below seem even more somber and deadly.

“Uncle, do you want to go?” Jin Tong asked.

“That green flame was probably a residual spirit, but why did it come to tell us this?” Han Li wondered.

“Could it be a trap?” Xi Huang asked.

“I don't think so, we just entered the Underworld, and even if it was the ghostly soldiers we encountered earlier, they were unexpected. It's unlikely that someone, or some ghostly creature, would set a trap for us in advance.” Han Li shook his head.

“Who cares, let's just go take a look, and we'll know what's going on.” Jin Tong said with a shrug.

“Besides, we don't know where to go anyway, so we might as well go and see what's there. Maybe we'll even find some information about the Underworld King's palace.” Xi Huang agreed.

“Alright, let's go take a look, but be careful on the way.” Han Li said.
After making their decision, the three of them flew up and sped towards the upper reaches of the river valley.

Before long, they arrived at the entrance to the valley.

In the center of the entrance was a narrow gorge, with two natural pathways on either side, suspended high above the steep cliffs.

Han Li and the others took the left path, and made their way up to the left cliff's pathway.

Standing at the edge of the pathway, they were met with a deafening roar of rushing water.

The crimson river surged out of the mountain valley, and at the narrow gorge, the water became even more turbulent, like a thousand red dragons fighting, their roars unceasing.

Han Li and the others watched for a while, then followed the cliff pathway, making their way deeper into the valley.

As they walked, they discovered that the valley was shaped like a gourd, with the entrance being the narrowest part, and the terrain becoming wider and more open as they went further in.

When they reached the middle of the valley, Han Li and the others stopped in their tracks.

The river's waterway was already several hundred meters wide, and in the center, a small island had appeared.

The island was covered in a layer of white sand, and from afar, they could see that there were specks of golden dust mixed in, reflecting tiny points of golden light.

In the center of the island stood a three- to four-meter-tall black withered tree, its entire trunk charred and carbonized, with crystalline formations visible on its surface.

What was most peculiar was that on the highest branch of the withered tree, a charred corpse was hanging, seemingly a human body, with its chest pierced by a tree branch, and its arms wrapped around a black square box.

"That corpse has a residual divine soul fluctuation, very weak, it seems to be the same guy who contacted us through the river." Ti Hou's gaze fell on the island, and she spoke up.

Han Li released his divine sense, carefully scanning the surroundings within a hundred miles, and finding nothing out of the ordinary, he spoke up.

"Let's go take a look."

With that, he took the lead, flying up and landing on the island.

Ti Hou and Jin Tong followed closely behind.

Han Li's feet landed on the island, making a soft rustling sound, and the sand beneath his feet was surprisingly soft.

Ti Hou couldn't help but bend down, picking up a handful of sand and sniffing it, then examining it closely, her eyebrows furrowed in suspicion.

"What's wrong with the bone powder?" Han Li asked.

"The bone powder is fine, but there's a problem with the gold sand mixed in." Ti Hou stood up, speaking.

"Gold sand?" Han Li asked, puzzled.

"That's Scattered Soul Sand, which can disperse souls, and is a favorite material for ghost cultivators who practice divine soul techniques." At this point, a gloomy voice suddenly came from the corpse on the tree.

Han Li and the others heard the voice, and simultaneously looked up.

They saw the charred corpse suddenly emit a wisp of white smoke, engulfing the entire skeleton.

A moment later, a frail, elderly Daoist with a benevolent face and golden feathered robes appeared in mid-air.

He was surrounded by a cluster of misty clouds, with a five-colored aura shining behind him, and beside him, only a single crane and a incense burner were missing to complete the image of a transcendent immortal.

However, the Daoist's posture was somewhat awkward, as the tree branch that had pierced his chest still protruded from his robes, looking rather incongruous.

"Fusheng Wuliang Tianzun..."

The Daoist revealed a mysterious smile, bowed his head, and slowly recited.

Han Li and the others exchanged a look, but no one spoke, simply staring at the Daoist like fools.

"Cough... I am Tian Qi, the Elder of the Taiyi Sect, from the Qianyuan Xian Domain, a true immortal realm. A hundred million years ago, I was betrayed and fell to this place. Today, I can finally meet you young friends, and it's all thanks to fate. If you can help me escape, I will surely reward you handsomely."

The Daoist spoke, his eyes fixed on Ti Hou, seemingly concerned about her reaction.

"Uncle, these words sound a bit familiar," Jin Tong said, raising an eyebrow.

"Earlier, Xue Li said the same thing, and now you're saying it too," Ti Hou replied.

"How come you people from the underworld all use the same script? Don't you have any creativity?" Jin Tong looked at the Daoist with disdain, sneering.

The Daoist's expression changed, and he forgot to maintain his dignified demeanor, hurriedly asking.

"You've already met Xue Li?"

"We have, and we were deceived by his words, it seems like you're familiar with him," Han Li said, smiling.

"We're not familiar, we're sworn enemies," the Daoist hastily replied.

"Really? You're not a true immortal, how can you be sworn enemies with someone from the underworld?" Han Li asked, his tone playful.

The Daoist knew he had misspoken, and his expression turned dejected, looking defeated.

"Ah, I knew it, you true immortals are all more cunning than ghosts, you can't fool us..." As he spoke, he sighed, and his body was once again enveloped in a cloud of white smoke.
