Qiu Zhanglao spoke in a solemn tone, "Tribe Leader, forgive me for speaking straightforwardly. This person just said they sensed the magical fluctuations in this place, so they came over, but I think it's not that simple. Even if this person's scouting technique is exceptional, allowing them to sense the situation here despite the multiple layers of restrictions, the Mysterious Void Great Array surrounding the Wood Spirit Basin should have reacted when they entered. However, I didn't feel any anomalies in the array. I suspect he secretly followed the Young Master, entered this place earlier, and has been spying on us, I'm not sure what his intentions are."

Ye Lü pondered for a moment, then shook his head and said, "Your words are not without reason, but these are just speculations. Even if Han Dao Friend secretly entered this place, he shouldn't have any malicious intentions towards the Qing Huo tribe, otherwise, he could have taken action earlier and killed us three, and no one would be able to stop him."

Qiu Zhanglao remained silent for a moment before speaking, "I understand, Tribe Leader. Regardless of his intentions, just looking at how easily he dispelled the cold poison in my body, his strength is far beyond ours. We must not offend such a person."

Ye Lü's expression relaxed, and he warned again, "I understand, but if we find out he's plotting against our tribe, I'll risk my life to stop him."

Qiu Zhanglao's eyes showed a hint of pain, and he nodded slowly.

Ye Lü didn't say anything else, just patted Qiu Zhanglao's shoulder lightly.

"Tribe Leader, you just dispelled the cold poison, and your vitality hasn't recovered yet. Please rest well, I'll take my leave." Qiu Zhanglao said, then bid farewell and left.

Ye Lü nodded, watching Qiu Zhanglao leave, then returned to the jade bed, sat down, and began to meditate to recover.

The night passed without incident.

The next morning, Ye Lü and Ye Su Su arrived at Han Li's residence, but Qiu Zhanglao didn't come. Ti Hu was also cultivating in the flower branch space and didn't come out.

"Qing Huo City is located in a remote area, and its architecture emphasizes natural style, so there's no grand, beautiful reception area. I apologize for letting Han Dao Friend reside in this small courtyard." Ye Lü said with a hint of apology.

After a day of rest, her complexion looked much better.

"No need to apologize, I prefer this quiet environment." Han Li let them in, smiling.

"Please don't hesitate to ask for anything, Han Dao Friend," Ye Lü said.

"Thank you, Tribe Leader. I've heard that the Qing Huo tribe excels at cultivating spirit herbs, and I'd like to request some. Here's the list." Han Li handed over a jade slip.

During his journey to the Jin Yuan Mountain Range, he had been gathering materials for a Tai Yi-grade elixir called the "Tian Qing Dan". He now had a considerable amount of spirit stones, as well as many precious materials from the Gray Realm, Demon Realm, and Ji Lin's realm.

He had used the Rebirth Palace's mask to purchase or exchange materials for the Tian Qing Dan, and now he only needed a few more materials. Coincidentally, he found that the Qing Huo City had the materials he needed.

Ye Lü had already learned about this from Ye Su Su, but when she received the jade slip, her expression still changed.

"Han Dao Friend requires a large quantity of spirit herbs, and the years required are also very high. However, please don't worry, Tribe Leader, I'm not asking the Qing Huo tribe to provide them for free." Han Li took out a storage device and placed it on the table.

"Tribe Leader, you're too kind. I should be the one to thank you." Ye Lü's divine sense scanned the storage device, and her expression turned slightly joyful, before she looked embarrassed.

"I... understand. But if I find out you're plotting against our tribe, I'll risk my life to stop you." Qiu Zhanglao had said earlier.

Ye Lü didn't say anything else, just patted Qiu Zhanglao's shoulder lightly.

"Su Su, please go and fetch the materials Han Dao Friend needs." Ye Lü handed the jade slip to Ye Su Su, instructing her.

"Yes." Ye Su Su replied, then left.

"Han Dao Friend, please forgive me for asking, but what brings you to our Qing Huo City?" Ye Lü asked, her eyes fixed on Han Li.

"Han Dao Friend, I have no malicious intentions towards the Qing Huo City. I just like the peaceful and safe environment here, and I want to cultivate in seclusion for a while. Is it possible?" Han Li replied, his expression sincere.

"Is that all?" Ye Lü's expression changed, showing a hint of surprise.

"Of course. I don't care about the Qing Huo tribe's other things, Tribe Leader can rest assured." Han Li waved his hand casually.

"Is that so... I was overthinking." Ye Lü observed Han Li's every expression, and seeing that he wasn't lying, her heart relaxed, and she smiled.
Han Li thanked the clan leader and then said with a profound meaning, "I hope the clan leader can help cover up the news of my and Ti Hu's presence here, it would be beneficial for both of us."

Ye Luo was taken aback, but nodded in agreement.

The two of them had a frank and open conversation, and after discussing the main topic, they both felt a bit more relaxed and started chatting about various things in the Jinyuan Mountain Range.

"Clan leader Ye Luo, I've read in some ancient texts that the demon tribes in the Jinyuan Mountain Range are not many, and most of them are from the outside world. Your Qing Huo tribe is skilled in wood-attribute divine abilities and illusions, which doesn't seem to match the environment here. Are you also from the outside world?"

Han Li asked suddenly, as if he had thought of something.

Ye Luo nodded, "What you said is correct, our tribe indeed migrated from the outside world many years ago and settled here."

"I'm sorry to ask, but where did your tribe migrate from?" Han Li asked further.

Ye Luo replied, "I'm not very clear about that, our tribe's ancient texts don't have any clear records. I remember reading a ancestor's notes, it seems that our tribe migrated from the southern part of the Jinyuan Continent, but it's been too long ago, I'm not very sure. Why did you ask this?"

Han Li smiled, "It's nothing, I just happened to meet another Liu-surnamed fox tribe many years ago, and I felt that they were similar to your Qing Huo tribe, so I asked."

Ye Luo's eyes lit up, "Liu-surnamed fox tribe? According to our tribe's ancient texts, when our Qing Huo tribe first settled here, a female ancestor named Liu Mei joined our tribe and brought the secret technique of cultivating spirit grass. It seems that she is the one who brought this technique. I and Su Su are also descendants of this Liu Mei ancestor, but she never mentioned her past, she is a mysterious figure in our tribe's history. Could it be that she is related to the Liu-surnamed fox tribe you mentioned?"

Han Li shook his head, "I'm not sure, I didn't have much contact with that Liu-surnamed fox tribe, I'm not sure if they also cultivate spirit grass."

Ye Luo's face showed a hint of disappointment, but she asked again, "Han Dao friend, can you tell me more about that Liu-surnamed fox tribe?"

Han Li thought for a moment before telling Ye Luo about his encounter with the Liu-surnamed fox tribe in the barbarian domain, but omitted the parts that involved himself.

Ye Luo listened attentively, nodded slowly, and then fell silent.

Just then, Ye Su Su flew in from outside and handed Han Li a storage artifact. "Han Shixiong, the spirit grass you wanted is inside, please check it."

Han Li took the storage artifact, scanned it with his divine sense, and nodded in satisfaction.

Ye Luo suddenly stood up, pulled Ye Su Su, and bid farewell to Han Li.

Han Li saw them off, closed the door, and then turned to the empty space, "What do you think of Ye Luo, is she speaking the truth?"

As soon as he finished speaking, a light door appeared beside him, and Ti Hu's figure emerged from it.

"Ye Luo's soul is very pure, she is not a deceitful person. I carefully examined her soul fluctuations when she spoke, and there were no unusual changes. What she said was the truth." Ti Hu said after a moment of thought.

Han Li's face relaxed, "That's good, it was worth me expending my energy to help her drive out the cold toxin last night."

Ti Hu's awakening had greatly increased her divine abilities, allowing her to see through people's true nature and judge whether they were telling the truth by sensing their soul fluctuations. This had saved Han Li a lot of trouble.

"Master, the Liu-surnamed fox tribe you mentioned to Ye Luo, is it the same as the Tian Huo tribe where Liu L'er is?" Ti Hu asked, her eyes sparkling.

Han Li nodded, "Yes, I was trying to find out if there's a connection between the two."

Ti Hu asked, "Does this mean that the Qing Huo tribe is actually a branch of the Tian Huo tribe?"

Han Li thought for a moment before responding, "I've sensed the Tian Huo tribe's bloodline power from Fox Three and the others, and it's similar to the Qing Huo tribe's bloodline power. Combining this with the mention of Liu Mei, I think there's likely a connection between the two tribes."

Ti Hu nodded, "Master, you've received the Liu-surnamed fox tribe's kindness, and staying here to cultivate in seclusion is not only to avoid trouble, but also to provide some protection for the Qing Huo tribe."

Han Li didn't dwell on this topic, "This is just a temporary measure, we'll leave some benefits for them when we leave. For now, I plan to start my seclusion immediately, I've been feeling uneasy lately, as if some danger is approaching, and I need to increase my strength as soon as possible."
