Tihu's eyes were closed, her arms tightly wrapped around Han Li, and only now did she barely open them.

"Master, are you okay?" Jintong saw Han Li panting, and his face changed.

"It's fine, just a bit of exhaustion... this guy has caught up." Han Li waved his hand, and then his expression changed as he looked in a certain direction.

"Indeed, he's got some skills, not disappointing me after waiting for so long."

The golden light in the distance flashed and disappeared, and Qimozu flew out, his eyes fixed on Han Li, rubbing his hands together, and laughing.

He held a short axe in his hand, emitting a dark light, and it seemed that the black streak of energy just now was cut out by this axe.

Han Li felt Qimozu's gaze, and for some reason, he had a feeling that his whole body was being seen through.

He hurriedly circulated the Time Laws, and in an instant, he barely managed to isolate the feeling of being seen through.

"Who are you, sir? I don't think we've met before!" Han Li took a deep breath and decided to probe Qimozu's bottom line, asking aloud.

"Ah, Huo Huo, Chi Rong, those two didn't show you my image? I am Qimozu, and I'm sure you've heard of this name. No need to say more, hand over the 'Great Five Elements Fantasy World Secret', and I'll spare your life." Qimozu's eyes flashed with a fiery light, and he stepped forward, saying.

"'Great Five Elements Fantasy World Secret'? What is that, a cultivation technique?" Han Li's heart shook, but his face remained expressionless.

"Hmph! You're just like Chi Rong said, a very dishonest little guy! But it's okay if you don't admit it, as long as I extract your divine soul, I'll know after searching your soul." Qimozu sneered, and his body flew out.

Han Li's feet flashed with golden light, and he quickly retreated.

"Master, don't bring me along, let me down, and use your full strength to deal with this guy, I can take care of myself." Tihu's beautiful eyes flashed, saying.

Han Li didn't move at all.

"Heh heh, sir, you're quite good at being gentle with a beauty, but don't worry, I'm not going to kill you, I just want your divine soul!" Qimozu laughed loudly, and a layer of black flame appeared on his short axe, slashing through the air.

A black streak of energy flew out, slashing towards Han Li, its speed almost twice as fast as before, and it reached Han Li's side in an instant.

The space around the black streak of energy, within a hundred feet, seemed to shatter like a mirror, and a series of spatial cracks appeared, spreading outward.

Han Li's face turned serious, and he let out a low roar, quickly casting the True Words Treasure Wheel.

Countless golden ripples expanded, instantly covering the surrounding area, and the black streak of energy was wrapped within.

The black streak of energy stopped, but the golden ripples region also shook violently, and it was only after a while that it stabilized.

"Ah, you've actually cultivated the 'True Words Transformation Wheel' to this extent." Qimozu's face showed surprise, but he didn't care, and his black short axe rose, ready to slash again.

Just then, Han Li's body flashed with golden light, and a golden spirit domain opened, covering the surrounding area.

Qimozu was enveloped by the golden spirit domain, and his movements slowed down by more than ten times.

Han Li simultaneously cast the True Words Treasure Wheel and the Time Spirit Domain, and his body's divine energy was consumed extremely quickly, but he didn't care, his hands waving continuously.

The next moment, a dozen golden lightning woods flew out of his sleeves, and after a brief condensation, they fell to the ground, forming a circle, which was the Lightning Wood Array.

Dazzling golden lightning flashed out from the dozen lightning woods, intertwining with each other.

Qimozu saw this scene, and it seemed that he had thought of something, and the golden flames on his body surged, and then "whoosh" expanded outward, instantly forming a golden flame spirit domain, covering the surrounding area.

Han Li was enveloped by the golden flame spirit domain, and his body immediately sank, his speed slowing down by ten times, but he still stubbornly circulated the Lightning Wood Array.

The array quickly charged, and it seemed that it was about to be complete.

Qimozu let out a loud shout, and a golden light flashed in front of him, and the golden fire stick appeared.

A series of flame spirit lights expanded from the golden fire stick, and everything in their path was frozen in place, the flame spirit lights expanding at an extremely fast speed, almost instantly covering Han Li and the surrounding area.

Han Li and the surrounding Lightning Wood Array immediately froze, stopped in place, and even the True Words Treasure Wheel and the surrounding golden ripples were frozen, completely suppressed.

Qimozu's face relaxed, and his black short axe flashed with dark light, and a dark streak of energy slashed towards Han Li's body.

Just as the dark streak of energy was about to hit, Han Li's body flashed with golden light, and a golden jade bottle appeared on his left side, containing half a bottle of half-transparent golden liquid, flashing with faint light, and on his right side, a golden hourglass appeared, with countless golden sand particles floating inside.

A golden fire stick appeared in front of him, burning with golden flames, and behind him, a small golden tree appeared.

The five Time Divine Arts released golden light, resonating with each other, and the time laws on them lit up, releasing a powerful and complete time law fluctuation.

Fifty time law crystals flew out from the True Words Treasure Wheel and other objects, forming a golden ring, rapidly rotating, and releasing a devouring force.

Qimozu's Broken Time Domain suddenly trembled, and a series of flame spirit lights flew out, entering the golden ring.

Han Li's body flashed with golden light, and he let out a loud roar, his body bursting with divine energy.
What! Qimozi's face changed in shock.

Han Li immediately recovered, and the surrounding lightning array also regained its vitality.

He immediately pinched his fingers, and the golden lightning array flashed, instantly condensing into shape.

"Swift!" Han Li's hand gesture immediately accelerated.

Boom!

The dazzling golden lightning burst forth from the lightning array, enveloping Han Li and Ti Hu.

As the golden lightning flashed, the void also violently fluctuated, generating waves like ripples on the surface of water, spreading outward.

Qimozi sensed this, and his eyes widened in fury, his face revealing a crazed expression, as the black short axe in his hand burst forth with light.

Boom! The short axe suddenly grew ten times larger, transforming into a massive black axe.

A violent, law-defying energy burst forth from the axe, and the void nearby began to collapse as the black light flashed.

Qimozi grasped the axe with both hands and swung it down at the lightning array.

Boom! A massive, hundred-meter-wide, ten-li-long black energy blade slashed out, shattering the void wherever it passed, generating a series of spatial whirlpools that swept across the surrounding area.

The sky instantly turned dark, and black clouds emerged, as fierce winds howled.

But Qimozi's attack was slightly late!

The black axe's energy was immense, but the lightning array's movements were even faster.

Just as the sound of thunder boomed, Han Li and Ti Hu's figures vanished into the lightning.

The black energy blade swept in, instantly tearing apart the lightning array, and the ten or so Jumu trees were completely shattered.

Qimozi's face fell, and he coldly snorted before retracting his axe, closing his eyes to sense.

After a moment, he opened his eyes, his face dark and cold, but then returned to normal.

"Heh heh, the Great Five Elements Phantom Realm Technique is indeed in your hands... This technique, once mastered, can absorb the power of time itself, truly worthy of being the strongest time-based technique!" Qimozi's eyes gleamed with excitement as he chuckled.

As he spoke, he waved his sleeve, and his body transformed into a golden rainbow, flying towards the Golden Source Immortal Palace.

...

Deep within the Golden Source mountain range, countless miles away from the Golden Source Immortal Palace.

A massive, golden mountain peak had an internal chamber, a several-zhang-sized stone room.

The stone room's walls were inscribed with spiritual patterns, emitting various colors of light.

A golden lightning array was set up on the floor, with ten or so golden lightning trees inserted around it, flashing with golden lightning.

Suddenly, the golden lightning array flashed, and a massive, golden light pillar burst forth, shooting towards the sky.

The spiritual patterns on the stone room's walls immediately lit up, and multiple layers of restrictive light screens appeared, flashing with various symbols, emitting waves of law-defying energy, blocking the golden lightning pillar.

The golden light pillar persisted for a few breaths before dissipating, revealing three figures inside: Han Li and Ti Hu.

"Where is this?" Ti Hu, now recovered, looked around in surprise.

"I set up this Jumu lightning array here before heading to the Golden Source Immortal Palace, just in case. I didn't expect to actually use it. This place is extremely far from the Golden Source Immortal Palace, and Qimozi's teleportation technique won't be able to find it." Han Li pinched his fingers, retracting the five time-based divine abilities surrounding him, and slowly spoke.

As he finished speaking, his brow furrowed, and he stumbled, almost falling to the ground, with a trace of blood on his lips.

"Master, you're injured!" Ti Hu hastily supported Han Li, exclaiming.

"I was too focused on controlling the lightning array and didn't have time to defend myself, so I was hit by Qimozi's axe energy. It injured my internal organs." Han Li waved his hand, taking out a green pill and swallowing it.

"This Qimozi is indeed formidable. If not for Master's prior preparations, we would have been in big trouble... Your injury doesn't seem light, why don't we rest here for a while?" Ti Hu said.

"The lightning array's activation was quite loud, and although I set up restrictions around us, it's possible that someone with ill intentions might have noticed. Let's leave here first." Han Li waved his hand, emitting a green light, and the lightning array on the ground disappeared.

The stone room's surroundings also flew out, and Han Li collected the array flags.

Han Li waved his hand, putting the items away, and pinched his fingers.

A golden lightning array reappeared around the two, and with a thunderous boom, their figures vanished into the lightning once more.
