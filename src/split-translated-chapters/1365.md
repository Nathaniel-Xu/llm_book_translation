This is a higher-level heavenly magic law than the Heart Magic Law! Are you the Heavenly Demon Ancestor from back then? The Demon Master stared at the Hiding Brightness Ancestor, speaking one word at a time.

The Hiding Brightness Ancestor didn't respond, standing quietly and blocking the path.

"What... Heavenly Demon Ancestor!" The white-robed fat woman's face changed upon hearing this.

The other three Demon Ancestors were also shocked, but the other Demon tribe members were bewildered.

The True Immortal Realm's people in the Jade Pool heard the Demon Master's words and were mostly confused, except for the three Ancestors of the Cangwu True Immortal, and a few individuals who had lived for extremely long periods of time, who changed their expressions and looked at the Hiding Brightness Ancestor in shock.

Dream Maiden was one of them.

"Master, who is the Heavenly Demon Ancestor? Everyone seems to be afraid of him." Yu Menghan noticed the eerie atmosphere and asked quietly.

"The Heavenly Demon Ancestor is a long-lived Ancestor from ancient times, with a lifespan that far exceeds that of the Supreme Ancient or the present. The Heavenly Demon magic law is mysterious and unpredictable... It's said that every time he closes his eyes, his soul wanders outside the heavens, and his thoughts and intentions become countless, seeping into various realms to search for suitable cultivators, and through infecting their hearts, he gains law enhancements... This is what many lower realm cultivators call the 'Domain Outside Heavenly Demon'." Dream Maiden looked at Yu Menghan and transmitted her voice, seemingly afraid of being overheard.

"Originally, the Domain Outside Heavenly Demon was created by this person!" Yu Menghan was shocked.

The Domain Outside Heavenly Demon was a heart disease for all cultivators who reached the Great Vehicle stage, with a certain probability of occurring every time their cultivation advanced, due to the Heavenly Demon's invasion, and countless people had fallen.

"Of course, this is just a rumor, and it's not necessarily true. However, the Heavenly Demon magic law is extremely terrifying, able to easily invade a cultivator's body, driving them mad, and then devouring their seven emotions' power to supplement his own strength. This person was a true great demon head in the past, who destroyed thousands of lower realm spaces and even destroyed several True Immortal Realm domains to devour the seven emotions' power. The Heavenly Court's master was enraged and dispatched over a dozen Ancestors to hunt him down, and he then disappeared, never to be seen again. Who would have thought he was still alive?" Dream Maiden's eyes flashed with a hint of fear.

"That's not necessarily true, maybe the Heavenly Demon Ancestor from back then is already dead, and this person is someone else who cultivated the Heavenly Demon magic law to the Ancestor realm." Yu Menghan wasn't intimidated by Dream Maiden's words and speculated.

"There's also that possibility, but regardless of whether this person is the Heavenly Demon Ancestor or not, they are extremely dangerous, and we should keep our distance." Dream Maiden said.

...

Inside the Ten Directions Immortal Array, Han Li looked at Meng Yuan, his brow slightly furrowed.

At this moment, Meng Yuan's entire body was surrounded by a white glow, and his originally white and unblemished skin suddenly began to wither and shrink, with wooden-like patterns appearing on his body.

At the same time, his outer clothing transformed into a bundle of withered grass in the span of a few breaths.

The originally childlike white-robed man had transformed into a straw man made of wood and withered grass in the blink of an eye.

Han Li's gaze swept over the straw man, and his heart felt a strange sensation.

"What kind of magic law is this..." Han Li thought to himself.

"The ancient divine people of legend, who could hold the heavenly constitution in their mouths and make prophecies with a single word, I wonder if they can compare to my cursed magic law?" Meng Yuan, now a straw man, suddenly spoke, his voice somewhat ethereal.

As soon as he finished speaking, a ball of blood light appeared in his left palm.

Almost simultaneously, Han Li felt a sharp pain in the palms of his three left arms.

He looked down and saw that the three palms had been simultaneously pierced, with blood flowing out.

Han Li tried to circulate his immortal energy to repair the wound, but the injury didn't heal, and the blood flowed out even faster.

"Don't be in a hurry, the show has just begun, enjoy it." Meng Yuan's ethereal voice echoed again.

Han Li's eyebrow suddenly twitched, and his three left arms suddenly appeared with three large holes, with blood flowing out uncontrollably.

From the moment the first wound appeared, Han Li had been secretly circulating his Refine Spirit Technique, using his divine sense to search for any hidden attack methods, but he found nothing.

"Could it be that he can really curse someone to death with just a curse?" Han Li wondered.

"Next, where should I go? The shoulders, perhaps..." Meng Yuan's voice echoed again.

Han Li heard the voice and immediately used his starlight energy to transform his body, with a dazzling white light appearing on his shoulders, like a layer of armor protecting his left and right shoulders.

However, it was completely useless, and his left shoulder suddenly burst open with a blood hole.

Han Li's face slightly sank, and his body flashed with light as he restored his human form.

"This method of yours is indeed unusual, I thought my physical body was strong enough, but I didn't expect it to be so fragile. Can you explain it to me?" Han Li looked at the straw man and asked.

"I can... but only after you die. I'll tell you everything then. Next, I'll go to the lower abdomen, it will be even more painful than before, Han friend, try to endure it, haha..." Meng Yuan said, followed by a maniacal laugh.

Immediately, Han Li's lower abdomen suddenly felt a sharp pain, and a hole the size of a child's arm appeared, with blood flowing out and wetting his clothes.

Han Li's face turned slightly pale, and he stumbled backward two steps.
Han Li tried to lift his heavily injured left arm, but found that it was as heavy as a lead weight, sinking down with a great deal of weight.

"Brother Han, don't pretend to be so weak, this little injury won't make you pale and unstable. But don't worry, there are still many methods left, you can slowly enjoy it." Meng Yuan's voice rang out, with a hint of ridicule.

"Brother is mistaken, it's just a small trick to attract attention." Han Li smiled and said, his right arm hidden in his sleeve suddenly made a swift motion.

"Whoosh, whoosh", two sounds of breaking air suddenly rang out.

Two golden sword lights, without making any electric sound, quietly shot out towards the straw man's head and back, the angle was very tricky, and the speed was extremely fast.

Only to see the straw man's front and back, Zi Shu and Dong Li Hu two figures suddenly flashed by, each blocking the flying swords.

"Indeed, seeing me receive such a heavy injury, you didn't continue to attack me, just to protect you. It seems that once your curse technique is activated, your body can't move. But I'm curious, why didn't you cast it outside the array, wouldn't that be foolproof?" Han Li said slowly.

"The Ten Directions Great Array can isolate the heavens and earth, the curse technique outside the array would also be isolated, if not, how could this great array trap you?" Meng Yuan answered directly.

"I see." Han Li nodded, his eyes suddenly filled with a fierce killing intent.

The seventy-two qing bamboo hornet swords suspended around Meng Yuan's three people suddenly flashed with sword light, and simultaneously shot out towards the three people.

Zi Shu and Dong Li Hu, one in front and one behind, protected Meng Yuan in the center, one person opened a golden light screen, and the other person isolated a purple flame light screen, combining into a huge spherical light screen, protecting the three people.

The seventy-two qing bamboo hornet swords continuously hummed, transforming into countless intersecting lightning sword shadows, surrounding the spherical light screen, unceasingly chopping at it, but unable to break through.

"Meng Yuan, don't say any more nonsense, hurry up and kill him." Dong Li Hu's eyebrows showed a hint of anger, scolding.

"You try it yourself..." Meng Yuan, who had transformed into a straw man, cursed in his heart, but didn't hesitate to cast his spell.

The next instant, Han Li felt a burning sensation in his chest, a wave of intense pain, and another mouthful of blood, which had pierced through his heart meridian.

After this attack, Han Li's forehead gradually began to sweat, he discovered that his left half of his body was becoming numb, not the numbness from excessive blood loss, but a feeling of his flesh and bones being sealed by a curse, making it impossible for his spiritual energy and star energy to circulate.

As if... his body was slowly turning into a straw man.

"This is not good..." Han Li muttered to himself, his mind stirring slightly.

The seventy-two qing bamboo hornet swords suddenly stopped their continuous attack, transforming back into the child-like form, after a brief flight, a majestic lightning gate appeared in the sky.

"Meng Yuan, hurry up, he seems to have realized something's wrong." Zi Shu urged.

"Don't rush, just one more needle into the dantian, and he'll be helpless, waiting to be captured..."

Meng Yuan could only silently curse, this curse technique was one of the most contrary to the heavenly way, usually difficult to cast, and if not careful, it would be more easily affected by the heavenly way.

As he spoke, the straw man's body, below the small abdomen, a transparent long needle, invisible to the naked eye, was slowly piercing into the dantian.

At the same time, Han Li also sensed a faint pain in his dantian.

"Rumble rumble..."

Just then, the heavenly sword array set up by the sword spirit child, the gate suddenly opened, a giant lightning sword, condensed from hundreds of golden dragons, shot down towards Meng Yuan.

Dong Li Hu looked up, his eyes suddenly changed, seeing that the sword light was heading straight for the gap between him and Zi Shu's light screen.

"This won't be able to block..."

He shouted, and directly withdrew his defensive light screen, flying up to meet the attack, one hand clenched, and a virtual image of several mountain peaks appeared in his palm, smashing towards the golden sword light.

The power of this punch was the combined strength of several famous mountains, its terror was unimaginable.

"Rumble" a loud sound!

The punch hit the golden sword light, but the sword light didn't slow down, directly dispersing it.

Dong Li Hu's eyes flashed with a hint of surprise, and he suddenly shouted: "Not good..."

The sword array just now was just a feint, not intending to clash head-on, and the two had just made contact before dispersing, so Dong Li Hu's punch had actually hit nothing.

Zi Shu also sensed that something was wrong, and hurried to intercept the scattered sword light, but it was too late.

One of the qing bamboo hornet swords had already flown close to Meng Yuan's side, hidden in the sword light.

And at this moment, the transparent long needle in the straw man's dantian was only an inch away from being completely inserted...
