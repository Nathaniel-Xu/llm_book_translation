“Sorry, I lost my composure for a moment…” Zi Ling said with a hint of embarrassment.

“No need to apologize, did you sense anything unusual?” Han Li asked with a slightly serious tone.

Zi Ling didn’t respond, only shaking her head silently, her expression somewhat gloomy.

Han Li only then noticed that the girl’s aura had greatly decreased, her cultivation level having dropped from the peak of the Taiyi realm to the middle stage of the Taiyi realm.

“Your cultivation…” Han Li couldn’t help but say.

“No need to worry.” Zi Ling said, shaking her head.

“Her cultivation level was originally boosted by the Celestial Ascension technique, and her foundation wasn’t stable to begin with. Now that she’s gone through this cycle of reincarnation, it’s not surprising that her cultivation level has dropped.” The Lord of the Cycle of Reincarnation chimed in.

Han Li turned to Zi Ling with a questioning gaze.

“I and Shi Chong Kong’s rapid progress in cultivation was due to the Crab Daoist using the secret technique of Celestial Ascension, forcefully taking the law of the universe from others who practiced similar techniques and implanting it into our bodies... so the current situation isn’t anything bad.” Zi Ling transmitted her voice.

Han Li heard this and slightly calmed down, but his mind still held doubts. What kind of memories of past lives had Zi Ling seen under the influence of the Cycle of Reincarnation, causing her to be so shaken that her cultivation level dropped?

“Who’s next?” The Lord of the Cycle of Reincarnation asked.

“Zi Ling’s cultivation level has dropped, I think... I won’t be using this technique of reincarnation.” Shi Chong Kong furrowed his brow, hesitating for a moment before speaking.

Han Li knew that Shi Chong Kong’s cultivation level had also been boosted in a similar way to Zi Ling, and that it was unstable, affecting his future prospects. He transmitted a reminder: “Shi brother, I know your cultivation level was boosted in the same way as Zi Ling, and that it’s unstable, affecting your future prospects. Why not take this opportunity to solidify your cultivation level?”

“At this critical moment, I don’t know when I’ll be able to return to the Great Luo. Moreover, the Crab Daoist had said before that as long as we cultivate diligently, our cultivation levels will gradually stabilize, and we’ll become true Great Luo cultivators.” Shi Chong Kong transmitted back.

Han Li heard this and didn’t try to persuade him further.

“That leaves only me.” Jin Tong said.

“You’re indeed the one who should use this Cycle of Reincarnation.” The Lord of the Cycle of Reincarnation looked at Jin Tong and said.

Jin Tong didn’t say much, excitedly taking large strides towards the water pool, immersing himself in it.

The Lord of the Cycle of Reincarnation began to cast a spell, submerging Jin Tong in the water.

Jin Tong felt his consciousness slowly sinking, and then he entered a void of darkness, losing all sense of feeling.

Just as he was about to lose consciousness, he suddenly felt like he had swallowed a mouthful of water, and he burst out of the water.

He found himself in a vast, turbulent sea, surrounded by waves that seemed to stretch on forever.

As he regained his senses, he heard a loud, thunderous voice.

“The net of heaven and earth has already been cast, you have nowhere to escape. If you don’t surrender and submit, you will be reduced to nothing.” A cold, detached voice came from the ninth heaven, like a rolling thunderclap.

Jin Tong’s ears were ringing, and he quickly looked up to see a figure standing hundreds of miles away. The figure was a man with a body like jade, over a hundred thousand feet tall, with short hair and a bare chest, his face like a golden statue, his eyes blazing with fury.

His muscles were like twisted ropes, and behind him shone a circle of golden light, radiating an intense, fiery aura that seemed to be filled with the power of the earth.

Just looking at him from afar gave Jin Tong a sense of overwhelming pressure, as if the man was an ancient, unstoppable god.

“Is this... the Dao Ancestor?” Jin Tong felt a chill run down his spine as he realized the true meaning of pressure. But for some reason, he didn’t feel any fear, and instead, a flame of determination rose up within him.

“Haha, Xuan Yuan Jie, the Dao Ancestor is not willing to submit to your heavenly tyranny. What can you do to me? If it weren’t for those petty traitors, you wouldn’t be able to touch me.” A voice that was both arrogant and defiant echoed from the other side of the sea.

Jin Tong felt a sense of connection and quickly looked over to see a massive wave rising up from the surface of the water, creating a massive whirlpool that seemed to stretch on forever.

The wave crashed down, and Jin Tong was swept up, flying into the air to avoid the torrent.

As he looked down, he saw a sight that left him stunned.

The area he had thought was a sea was actually a lost continent, floating in the void, with jagged edges and clear signs of being broken off by some external force.
The cloud cover above had thinned to a mere layer, and beyond that, the vast expanse of the void stretched out. In the sky above the lost continent, thousands of powerful heavenly court cultivators were scattered, each one exuding a powerful aura of earth attribute laws. A massive, jade-green city floated above, its walls radiating a brilliant green light.

The city's four gates were anchored to the ground by hundreds of thick, jade-green chains that stretched down to the broken continent below. It seemed as if the chains were suspending the continent in mid-air.

Suddenly, a massive, golden beetle burst forth from the continent's core, its six wings beating fiercely as it released a vortex of golden energy. The sound of its emergence shook the heavens.

Jin Tong's eyes widened as he recognized the beetle's aura, realizing it was a fellow Devouring Gold Insect, but one whose cultivation realm far surpassed his own. The insect's golden armor was badly damaged, and its wings were reduced to mere fragments. A massive, jade-green chain wrapped around its body, connecting it to the city above.

As the beetle emerged, the city's chains tightened, and the entire structure began to descend, pressing down on the insect. Xuan Yuan Jie, the jade giant, took a step forward and raised his fist, unleashing a massive, green energy vortex that hurtled towards the beetle's head.

The beetle let out a deafening roar as it charged forward, its jaws wide open. The green energy vortex shattered upon impact, and the giant's arm exploded, releasing a massive gust of wind that sent the chains wrapped around the beetle flying.

The city finally came to rest on the beetle's back, radiating a brilliant green light. The beetle's golden armor began to crack and shatter, revealing a decaying, ancient structure beneath.

Xuan Yuan Jie's face twisted in rage as the beetle's aura surged, and a massive, golden energy explosion erupted from its body, sending the city flying and shattering the surrounding space. The cultivators within the city were obliterated, their bodies reduced to mere fragments.

A figure emerged from the golden light, a tall, slender woman with her arms outstretched. She tore apart the city and Xuan Yuan Jie's web-like energy, revealing a massive, void-like tear in the sky.

A river of golden light flowed from the tear, carrying countless Devouring Gold Insect larvae into the void. The larvae dispersed, carried away by the winds of space, and their eventual destinations remained unknown.

Jin Tong, witnessing the scene, felt his blood boil with excitement. He realized that in his past life, he had been forced to destroy his own golden body and scatter his essence across the land.

As the last remnants of the golden light faded, the woman's figure began to dissipate. Xuan Yuan Jie's rage reached its peak, and he unleashed a devastating fist, shattering the woman's fading image.

The remaining sparks of golden light drifted towards Jin Tong, and he felt a surge of complex emotions. His body began to glow with a brilliant, golden light, and he charged forward, only to be halted by a mysterious, watery barrier.

As he stumbled through the barrier, Jin Tong found himself back in the presence of the six-turning wheel of reincarnation, which had ceased its rotation.
