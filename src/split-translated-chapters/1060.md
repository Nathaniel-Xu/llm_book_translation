As the ghostly creatures approached within a hundred feet of the group, a loud dragon's roar suddenly resounded, and a layer of blue light burst forth from their bodies, expanding outward.

The blue light on the surface of the light curtain flowed and swirled, forming a series of blue dragon silhouettes that twisted and turned, flowing and changing without cease. Within the light curtain, a burst of auspicious and precious light shot upward, piercing through the dark clouds.

The ghostly creatures that collided with the blue light curtain let out a series of heart-wrenching cries.

The light curtain's blue light flickered rapidly, and the evil spirits that collided with it were like snow meeting the scorching sun, emitting a series of "hiss" sounds as they dissipated into nothingness, leaving behind only a trail of dark smoke.

However, the evil spirits that were trapped here had not tasted the flesh of the living for who knows how many years, and had long since lost all sense of reason, madly rushing forward without any regard for life or death. Even as they were continuously dissipated, they still continued to press forward, wave after wave.

Han Li's gaze swept around him, his expression unchanging as he beheld the endless tide of ghostly creatures.

"What are you doing? If you're not going to contribute, then don't expect us to help you!" Jing Liu shouted in anger.

Han Li ignored Jing Liu's words, standing upright and motionless at the center of the group, neither lending his assistance to the formation nor engaging in combat. Instead, he gazed upward, his eyes fixed intently on the dark, foreboding sky, lost in thought.

In the high air, the cultivators of the Tian Shui Sect were also engaged in a fierce battle with the ten red-robed ghostly generals.

These ghostly generals were different from the countless ghostly creatures below, each one possessing an astonishing level of cultivation, with most of them rivaling the peak of the Golden Immortal realm. Their cultivation methods were mysterious and unpredictable, and their techniques were endless.

The ghostly general who appeared to be a scholar possessed the highest level of cultivation, rivaling that of a mid-stage Tai Yi cultivator. His crimson official robes were the most sinister, with two wide sleeves that seemed to be like the vast expanse of the universe.

As he swept his left sleeve downward, a torrent of dark energy burst forth, enveloping Su Zhongling's head.

Su Zhongling's hand already grasped a water fan surrounded by a blue glow, and as she waved it back and forth, the fan's surface emitted a burst of light that tore through the void, creating a massive gash that stretched across the sky.

At the same time, the nine-bend river diagram on the water fan's surface flashed with light, and then disappeared.

The sound of rushing water filled the air as a massive river burst forth from the gash, surging upward and crashing against the scholar.

The scholar's face revealed a mocking smile as his sleeves fluttered, and a massive black whirlpool formed, swallowing the river water.

The river water seemed to be endless, and the scholar's sleeves were like a bottomless abyss, absorbing the water without any limit.

After the river water was absorbed into the scholar's left sleeve, a loud rumbling sound echoed, and his right sleeve shook, releasing a torrent of murky water that crashed against Su Zhongling.

However, the water that flowed from the scholar's right sleeve was now turbid, filled with floating corpses and blood.

Su Zhongling's expression changed as she beheld the scene, and with a flick of her wrist, the water fan's surface flashed with light, sealing the gash in the void and absorbing the scholar's counterattack.

A moment later, the river water dissipated, and the gash in the void closed, disappearing from sight.

On the surface of Su Zhongling's water fan, the blue light reappeared, and the nine-bend river diagram reformed, but the river water was now murky and impure.

At the same time, the fan's surface was shrouded in a faint, black mist that seemed to be difficult to dispel.

Su Zhongling's expression changed slightly as she beheld the scene, and with a flick of her wrist, the fan's surface emitted a burst of cold energy, sealing the river diagram in a layer of white light, as if it had been frozen in ice.

"You have a decent treasure, I'll take it for myself," the scholar said with a sinister laugh. "In the future, I'll cast ten million yin souls into that river, and refine it into a river of the underworld. As for you, little girl, you'll make a good concubine for me..."

Su Zhongling's eyes narrowed, and a cold, fierce light flashed within them. With a flick of her wrist, a wave of water flowed from her palm, coalescing into a clear, blue longsword.

"I'll fulfill your wish, and trap you beneath the ice of my fan, where you'll be unable to escape for eternity," she said, her voice cold and menacing. With a sudden burst of speed, she charged toward the scholar, engaging him in close combat.

The scholar laughed wildly, his sleeves fluttering as he welcomed the attack, and the two of them clashed in a fierce battle.

On the other side, Jing Liu wielded a pair of dragon-headed spears, engaging in a fierce battle with two of the red-robed ghostly generals.

One of the generals had the body of a human and the head of a cow, wielding a blood-red banner that seemed to be able to control the spirits of the dead. The other general had the body of a human and the face of a horse, wielding a set of black chains that seemed to be able to corrode the flesh and bones of his enemies.

The two ghostly generals were both at the early stage of the Tai Yi realm, and were extremely difficult to deal with. Jing Liu was able to barely suppress them, but was unable to gain the upper hand.

As for Han Li, he stood at the center of the group, his expression uncertain.
Although the current war situation is still unclear, he knew that if it dragged on, it would inevitably lead to a situation where one side would weaken and the other would gain the upper hand, making things increasingly unfavorable for them.

Moreover, from the moment he entered this place, he had sensed that in the dark clouds above, a pair of eyes seemed to be watching their every move.

The ten red-robed ghost generals in front of him, who claimed to be the Ten Yama Kings, were not the strongest existence in this space. The truly terrifying being, who was hiding in the dark clouds above, had not yet appeared.

Since he didn't make a move, Han Li didn't intend to make the first move either. He was just being cautious and observing the situation.

But just then, a loud "rumbling" sound came from the Tianwang Temple on the other side of the mountain, causing the entire earth to shake violently.

Han Li concentrated his gaze in that direction and saw that the roof of the Tianwang Temple had been blown open, and the two giant statues of the Heavenly Kings inside had come to life. They were tearing open the walls and taking large strides towards them.

"Boom", "boom", "boom"

The two Heavenly King statues, with their armor broken and worn, were marching towards them, carrying two human head statues in their hands. They were thrown like sandbags, flying towards the Qīnglóng Huì Yuán Array.

Two blood-red human head statues flew through the air, hitting the Qīnglóng Huì Yuán Array with a force that shook the entire formation.

The people maintaining the array suddenly felt a heavy pressure, and their bodies shook. They spat out a mouthful of blood.

As they were injured, the array they were maintaining began to destabilize, and the Qīnglóng Huì Yuán Array's cyan light began to fade. The surrounding yīn qi ghosts grew more frenzied and charged forward.

In an instant, the Qīnglóng Huì Yuán Array was shrouded in black smoke, and countless yīn qi ghosts were dissolving. The array's cyan light was disappearing, and it seemed like it was about to collapse.

Han Li saw that the two Heavenly King statues were approaching, their feet trampling on the yīn qi ghosts. The demon-subduing mallet in their hands was raised high, as if ready to be thrown.

If the Qīnglóng Huì Yuán Array suffered another blow, not only would the array be unable to hold, but the people maintaining it would also be affected by the array's backlash, resulting in heavy casualties.

"Fine, since you won't make a move, I'll force you to," Han Li thought to himself, his single arm rising. He swung his hand, and a burst of breaking wind sound came from the void.

Eighteen cyan-colored light beams flashed and flew out of the light curtain, scattering and falling to the ground around the array.

"Clang, clang, clang..."

As the sound of sharp metal echoed, eighteen cyan-colored bamboo swords fell to the ground, embedding themselves into the earth around the array's perimeter, surrounding the entire formation and the people within.

"This is...?" Fù Gǔ Zhǔ's eyes widened in surprise as he turned to look at Han Li.

The others, seeing the swords fall to the ground, were even more perplexed.

The yīn qi ghosts didn't care about these developments and continued to charge at the array. Soon, they had engulfed all the cyan-colored bamboo swords, and the array's spiritual energy seemed to have been depleted. Although it could still block the ghosts, it couldn't eliminate them like before.

The dense yīn qi ghosts continued to climb higher, eventually covering the entire cyan-colored light curtain.

The two Heavenly King statues stopped their actions, not throwing the demon-subduing mallet again.

"They're finished..." Sū Zhū Xiǎo's expression changed, and she sighed.

"Don't worry about them for now. Let's focus on dealing with the current situation..." Jìng Liú's face was stern, and he shouted.

Before he finished speaking, a sudden change occurred on the square.

"Boom, boom, boom"

A loud thunderclap sounded, and eighteen golden lightning pillars, as thick as pillars, burst forth from the ground, shooting straight up into the sky.

A blinding golden light enveloped the area, and a torrent of electricity surged forward, sweeping across the square in all directions. The entire area was bathed in a golden hue, making it impossible to look directly at it.

A loud "hiss" sound filled the air.

As the golden lightning passed through, a large number of black smoke clouds rose, and countless yīn qi ghosts were swept away, disappearing into the air.

"This is... the Demon-Expelling Divine Lightning!" Sū Zhū Xiǎo's eyes widened in surprise as she exclaimed.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he thought to himself, "It seems that the true master of this place has finally made a move."
