Si Kong Jian was still on high alert, muttering to himself as he raised his wooden ruler. 

"Huala!"

The green trees in the spiritual realm converged, forming two wooden cocoons that shot out in an instant.

The wooden ruler emitted a flash of spiritual light, and two green fire cores shot out, merging with the cocoons.

The green cocoons burst into flames, transforming into two wooden thunderbolts that shot into the black hole like meteors.

A deafening explosion echoed from the black hole, causing it to distort and expand, almost affecting half of the arena.

The restrictions surrounding the arena emitted a cracking sound, once again showing signs of strain. The onlookers gasped in shock.

Si Kong Jian's face turned pale, and the green glow on his body dimmed significantly. It was clear that using the wooden thunderbolt attack had taken a great toll on him.

Just as he was about to take out a medicinal pill to catch his breath, a piercing shriek echoed from the black hole.

The black hole rumbled, and a red glow shot out, revealing one of the wooden thunderbolts that Si Kong Jian had just released. It shot towards him like a meteor.

Si Kong Jian was shocked, unsure of how his attack had been controlled by his opponent. He hastily activated the green trees in his spiritual realm to block the attack, retreating rapidly.

However, just as he did so, he heard a cold snort, and his mind was filled with intense pain, as if he had been stabbed with a steel needle. He couldn't help but cry out in pain, his retreating figure stumbling.

In that instant, the wooden thunderbolt shattered the green trees in front of him, reaching Si Kong Jian in the blink of an eye. It slammed into him with incredible force.

A deafening explosion shook the air!

The wooden thunderbolt exploded, releasing a blinding flash of red and green light that swept across the surroundings, causing the space to shatter inch by inch.

Si Kong Jian's heart skipped a beat.

He knew the power of the wooden thunderbolt, and he gritted his teeth, using his wooden ruler to create a green light shield that protected his body.

The green light shield was formed just in time, as the red and green light burst forth.

A deafening explosion shook the air!

Si Kong Jian was blown away, but the green light shield around him remained intact, flashing intensely as it withstood the blast.

Although the green light shield was incredibly resilient, it couldn't withstand the full force of the explosion. A small portion of the energy managed to penetrate the shield, striking Si Kong Jian's body.

Si Kong Jian's body emitted a series of cracking sounds as his bones shattered, and his mouth was filled with blood.

Just then, a phantom image shot out of the first black hole, chasing after Si Kong Jian as he was blown away. It slammed into him with incredible force.

The two of them flew out of the arena, crashing into the restrictions surrounding the platform.

The phantom image revealed itself to be Han Li.

He was surrounded by a crystalline light membrane, the true extreme membrane. However, beneath the membrane, his body was covered in tattered clothes, his skin charred and bloody.

Si Kong Jian was struck again, spitting out a mouthful of blood.

Han Li stretched out his left hand, pinning Si Kong Jian to the restrictions surrounding the platform. His right fist shone with golden light, emitting an intense power surge that was almost blinding.

He swung his right fist, and it transformed into a golden phantom image that slammed into Si Kong Jian's chest.

The restrictions surrounding the platform shattered, and Si Kong Jian was blown away like a broken sack, crashing to the ground.

The referee, who had been watching from a distance, flew over and declared Han Li the winner.

The situation had taken a drastic turn, with Si Kong Jian, who had been in the lead, suddenly falling behind. The onlookers were shocked.

Han Li's face showed a mixture of surprise and curiosity as he looked at Si Kong Jian, who was being helped to his feet by the people from the Lone Sun Peak.

"How did you take control of my wooden thunderbolt?" Si Kong Jian asked, his eyes fixed intently on Han Li.

Han Li didn't respond, instead choosing to take a recovery pill and hide his aura behind the black mask.

The pure and unadulterated true person and the others looked at Han Li with a mixture of surprise and curiosity.

Lu Chuanfeng chuckled, saying, "It seems we underestimated this young man. He has hidden abilities beyond his physical strength. He's indeed a formidable opponent, not simple at all."

The pure and unadulterated true person and the others turned their attention to the other arenas, but Chi Xiao, who had been watching the battle, couldn't help but glance at Han Li again, a hint of confusion in her eyes.

Han Li felt the pure and unadulterated true person's gaze move away, and he let out a sigh of relief, walking down from the arena.
"Sorry, I have nothing to say." Han Li said calmly and then walked away.

The difference in power between each small realm in the Da Luo Realm was enormous, and Si Kong Jian's mid-stage Da Luo cultivation was extremely powerful. Even if he used all of his Xuan Miao's power, he couldn't win, so he had just been knocked into a space black hole by Si Kong Jian. He had risked using the Xuan Tian Gourd to counterattack and snatch the Mu Shen Pi Li Zi, using a clever trick to win.

Si Kong Jian looked at Han Li's back, his eyes flashing with venom.

"Let's go!" He suddenly roared, turning to walk towards the exit of the Jiu Yuan Guan mountain gate.

The others from the Guo Yang Peak quickly followed.

Han Li returned to the Xian Shan Sect, and everyone immediately came to greet him.

"Thank you, Brother Chang," Zhou Xian Yang said tightly grasping Han Li's hand, his eyes shining with excitement.

"No need to thank me, this is what I should do," Han Li said with a light smile.

He chatted with the others for a few moments, then sat down to meditate and recover from his injuries.

Speaking of which, Han Li and Si Kong Jian's battle, although it seemed complex, was actually the fastest to end. At this moment, the other battles on the other arenas were still ongoing.

However, the battles on the other arenas didn't last much longer, and within half a day, the winners and losers had been decided.

Before long, Han Li and the other eleven people stood on a arena, facing the thousands of surrounding cultivators.

Luo Yuan Shan from the Qing Hui Lin, Wen Chang Tian from the Song Tian Men, and Zi Luo Xian Zi from the Tian You Hu had all won, standing on the stage.

"After three days of competition, the twelve final winners have been chosen, and these twelve Bodhi Tokens will naturally belong to the twelve winning sects," said Chun Jun Zhen Ren with a smile.

The leaders of the twelve sects, including the Xian Shan Sect, stood up and bowed to the surrounding cultivators.

"The Bodhi Token is a treasure of the Heavenly Court, and cannot be lightly given. The award ceremony will be held in the Jiu Yuan Pavilion seven days from now, and we invite all of you to attend," Chun Jun Zhen Ren said.

The crowd below responded in unison.

Chun Jun Zhen Ren quickly announced the end of the competition, and the crowd didn't linger, heading towards the mountain gate.

Han Li and the Xian Shan Sect group headed down the mountain.

But halfway down, they stopped, Han Li's eyes narrowing as he frowned slightly.

On the road ahead, a red figure stood out, it was Chi Meng.

"Xian Shan Sect's Zhou Xian Yang, greeting Chi Meng Xian Zi," Zhou Xian Yang quickly bowed to Chi Meng.

The others from the Xian Shan Sect also bowed, and Han Li nodded to Chi Meng.

"No need to be polite, Sect Master Zhou," Chi Meng said calmly, her beautiful eyes ignoring Zhou Xian Yang and instead looking at Han Li.

"I don't know what Chi Meng Xian Zi wants to do," Zhou Xian Yang said with a smile, his heart skipping a beat as he saw Chi Meng's gaze on Han Li.

"I just wanted to get to know Brother Chang, who showed incredible power in the competition. I don't know if I have the honor of meeting him," Chi Meng said with a smile.

"Chi Meng Xian Zi is an important figure in the Heavenly Court, and such a beauty, willing to lower herself to meet me, I am truly delighted," Han Li said with a calm smile.

"Brother Chang is a witty person, a true gentleman," Chi Meng said with a slight smile.

"Brother Zhou, take the others back to the Xian Shan Sect, I'll be there soon," Han Li said to Zhou Xian Yang.

"Okay, Brother Chang, I'll go first," Zhou Xian Yang said hesitantly, nodding in agreement.

He then bowed to Chi Meng and led the others away quickly.

On the small path, only Han Li and Chi Meng were left.

"The Golden Maple Forest, a famous scenic spot in the Jiu Yuan Guan, is not far from here. Would Brother Chang like to accompany me to take a look?" Chi Meng said with a smile.

Han Li was taken aback, and a figure from his past flashed in his mind. It was Chen Qiao Qian, his fellow disciple from the Huang Feng Valley.

But Chen Qiao Qian had long since turned to dust, and he didn't know if she had been reborn or where she was now.

"Since there is a beautiful scenery, and a beautiful woman, I would be delighted to accompany you, Chi Meng," Han Li said with a calm smile.

Originally, Han Li's cautious nature would not have allowed him to chat with Chi Meng, but now he was pretending to be Chang Qi, and Chang Qi was a lively and charming person who loved beautiful women.

He had no choice but to pretend to be so.

Chi Meng smiled, her beautiful eyes sparkling, and she walked ahead.

Han Li followed, his heart still a bit uneasy.
