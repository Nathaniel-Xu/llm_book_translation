Han Li and Chi Meng walked forward for a distance, soon arriving at a secluded area.

After turning a corner, a vast mountain valley appeared before them, filled with golden maple trees that shone brightly in the sunlight. The trees seemed to radiate a natural beauty, untainted by any hint of vulgarity.

The golden maples covered the entire mountain, creating a breathtakingly beautiful scene that was truly rare.

"These golden maples are called Flowing Light Golden Maples, a rare type of spiritual tree that only grows in areas with dense golden elemental energy. Not only are they beautiful, but they also emit a gentle golden aura that is beneficial for physical cultivation." Chi Meng said as she walked.

"Is that so? Chi Meng fairy not only has extensive knowledge, but also has a deep understanding of physical cultivation. I, Han Li, am impressed." Han Li's eyes seemed to have a hint of distraction, and he praised Chi Meng.

As soon as he arrived at the maple forest, he had discovered the gentle golden aura that permeated the air, which was beneficial for nourishing his body.

"I am just a paper tiger, Chi Meng fairy. Your physical cultivation is nearly perfect, and I am not worthy of comparison. I wonder, how did you manage to cultivate your body to such a realm? There must be some secret techniques involved." Chi Meng's beautiful eyes sparkled as she asked.

"People's physical constitutions are different, and the methods of physical cultivation vary accordingly. I, Han Li, have been traveling extensively, and it was only through chance encounters that I was able to open up some of the mystical orifices in my body. Chi Meng fairy is too kind." Han Li looked at Chi Meng's elegant figure, and replied vaguely.

"I see. It seems that traveling extensively is indeed beneficial. I, too, would like to go out and explore more. Unfortunately, I have limited experience, and my recent trip to Jinjin City was quite eventful." Chi Meng smiled, and then sighed.

"Someone dared to provoke you, Chi Meng fairy?" Han Li's heart skipped a beat, but he struggled to maintain his composure, and asked with a hint of surprise.

"I was sent by the Heavenly Court to capture a fugitive, but things took an unexpected turn, and the person was rescued. Moreover, the people who accompanied me were all killed." Chi Meng's expression turned cold.

"Oh, someone actually dared to obstruct the Heavenly Court's business. I wonder who is so bold. Could it be the fugitive's accomplice?" Han Li asked calmly.

"I don't know if it's the accomplice, but the person's physical strength is extremely powerful. It's similar to yours, Chi Meng fairy." Chi Meng's gaze locked onto Han Li, and she said slowly.

"Why are you looking at me like that, Chi Meng fairy? You don't think I'm the one, do you? My sect has been keeping me hidden for thousands of years, and I have been cultivating in seclusion. I have never left the mountain, and Chi Meng fairy can investigate if she doesn't believe me." Han Li laughed, and said seriously.

Although he was laughing, his heart was secretly sighing. It seemed that no matter how hard he tried to hide, Chi Meng had still discovered something.

This was not surprising, as a Grand Luo Realm cultivator's perception was extremely keen. Even if the Wheel of Reincarnation's mask could perfectly conceal his aura, once he took action, he would inevitably reveal some clues.

However, looking at Chi Meng's expression, it seemed that she was only suspicious.

"Is that so...?" Chi Meng smiled faintly, and her right hand flipped, revealing a white spherical object. The sphere had numerous golden patterns etched onto its surface, and a white vortex swirled within.

"What is this treasure?" Han Li's heart stirred, and he asked.

"This is called the Zhou Tian Instrument, which is capable of sensing and detecting the power of laws. I wonder if you, Han Li, dare to let me test your law power and see if it's similar to that person's?" Chi Meng's gaze locked onto Han Li, her voice growing softer.

At the same time, several powerful auras emerged from the surrounding maple forest, locking onto Han Li.

"This... just because I have a strong physical body, Chi Meng fairy suspects me of being the Heavenly Court's fugitive, and now you want to investigate my law power? Isn't this a bit too much?" Han Li's face turned slightly ugly.

"Please forgive me, I have no choice. If you can prove that you're not that person, I'll apologize and offer you a cup of wine." Chi Meng curtsied, her starry eyes still fixed on Han Li, not relaxing in the slightest.

"Chi Meng fairy's status is lofty, and she's a key figure in the Heavenly Court, as well as the granddaughter of the Red Fusion Dao Ancestor. I, Han Li, am just a lowly elder of the Xian Mountain Sect. If you want to investigate me, please go ahead. However, I must ask, what kind of law power does that person cultivate, so that I won't be wrongly accused?" Han Li's thoughts were racing, and he coldly replied.

They were currently in the Jiuyuan Temple, and if he refused to let Chi Meng investigate, it would only attract more attention, making things worse.

For now, he could only hope that the Wheel of Reincarnation's black mask was more exquisite than Chi Meng's Zhou Tian Instrument.

As Han Li's thoughts turned, he simultaneously activated the "Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique", hiding the time law power within his body.

He also concentrated his spiritual energy, retracting it inward.

At this moment, the time law power within his body suddenly collapsed inward, gathering into a single point, and forming a golden spherical object the size of a chicken egg.

The golden sphere was round and smooth, giving off a sense of perfection, and all the time law power was contained within, without any leakage.

Han Li sensed this situation, and his heart skipped a beat.

"That person's secret technique is a bit mixed, but the main one is the time law power, one of the three supreme laws. Thank you, Han Li, for your cooperation." Chi Meng ignored Han Li's sarcastic words, and smiled faintly.

She began to chant, and the white spherical object in her hand started to rotate, emitting a bright light. The golden patterns on its surface shone brightly, and the white vortex within swirled rapidly.

A formless wave emerged from the sphere, entering Han Li's body.

Han Li's spiritual energy immediately trembled, and his body began to reveal its true state.

His skin surfaced with a black glow, and tiny golden lightning sparks appeared.

At the same time, the golden maple trees surrounding them began to glow, as if they were being stimulated by Han Li's law power.
The black light was the law of the universe that Chang Qi was cultivating, while the golden lightning was the law of the Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword.

Han Li's Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword had been re-refined a while ago, and the power of the law it contained was completely different from before, and it was not expected to be recognized.

Han Li's time law was hidden deep within his body, stable and unshakeable, and was not affected by Zhou Tian Yi.

Sensing this situation, he was overjoyed, and his expression did not reveal anything, still maintaining a cold and angry demeanor.

Chi Meng saw this scene and was taken aback, but she did not give up, and instead increased her control over Zhou Tian Yi.

The Immortal Qi within Han Li's body trembled even more violently, and more black light and lightning laws appeared, but there was no other change.

"Is that enough?" Han Li asked coldly.

Chi Meng's beautiful eyes sparkled, and she pressed a seal on the white orb, causing the light to disappear.

The Immortal Qi within Han Li's body returned to calm, and the laws surrounding him also disappeared.

"It seems I have misunderstood Chang Dao, I apologize to you, and I will set up a banquet in the Kaiyuan Building in Jiuyuan City to apologize to Chang Dao." Chi Meng said with a bow.

"No need to apologize, is there anything else you need to discuss? If not, I will take my leave." Han Li replied coldly, not waiting for Chi Meng to respond, and turned to leave the Golden Maple Forest.

Chi Meng watched as Han Li's figure disappeared into the distance, her eyebrows still not fully relaxed.

She then turned and disappeared into the Golden Maple Forest, and the other auras in the forest also disappeared.

Han Li returned to the Xianshan Villa, and Zhou Xian Yang had already been waiting for him. As soon as Han Li arrived, he asked, "Han Dao, did Chi Meng discover your true identity?"

"No, she just wanted to see if my physical cultivation was strong, and asked me to teach her about it." Han Li replied, deciding not to tell Zhou Xian Yang about the events that had just occurred.

He had already completed his task, and did not want anything to happen that would affect his obtaining the information about the Golden Child.

"That's good." Zhou Xian Yang said, relieved.

"Speaking of which, Han Dao's physical cultivation has reached such a high level, it's truly enviable. Do you have any secrets to share? I'm willing to exchange 50 million Immortal Coins for it." Zhou Xian Yang asked, his eyes shining with excitement.

"I don't have any secrets, my physical cultivation is just a coincidence." Han Li replied.

Zhou Xian Yang's face fell, disappointed.

"Zhou Dao, I have already completed my task, and obtained a Bodhi Command for the Xianshan Sect. When will you fulfill your promise to me?" Han Li asked.

"Please be patient, Han Dao, Wu Yang has already received the news about the three trials, and what you want has already been sent over. However, I need to receive the Bodhi Command first before I can give it to you." Zhou Xian Yang replied.

"A fair trade, one hand gives the money, the other hand gives the goods. Very well, let's talk again in seven days." Han Li said.

Zhou Xian Yang did not stay any longer, and after exchanging a few words with Han Li, he left.

Han Li sat down, closed his eyes, and began to cultivate.

Seven days passed quickly, and Han Li followed the Xianshan Sect's group to the Jiuyuan Temple.

The Jiuyuan Temple had already sent people to wait for them, and led the Xianshan Sect's group towards the inner temple.

Han Li followed the group, while secretly observing the situation within the Jiuyuan Temple. He had already asked Lan Yan to describe the situation within the temple, and had drawn a map of the temple's layout.

The Jiuyuan Temple was divided into two parts, the outer temple and the inner temple.

Unfortunately, Lan Yan's status was not high, and he had only been to the outer temple before. The inner temple was only visited once or twice, and the map only showed the outer temple's layout.

However, the places Han Li saw now were all on the map, which made him feel more at ease.
