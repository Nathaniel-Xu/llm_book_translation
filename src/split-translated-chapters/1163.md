The two of us are from the Silver Horned Rhinoceros Tribe and the Cloud Patterned Tiger Tribe..." Santu's voice was a bit dry and tense.

The guard looked at him with a start, turned to another soldier, and asked with a questioning expression.

"I've never heard of it, and it seems that neither the Wasteland Tribe nor the Hundred Tribes have such a tribe." The other soldier thought for a moment, shook his head, and said.

"We are two small tribes under the jurisdiction of the Earth Dragon Tribe, sir. You probably haven't heard of us." Yunbao had already gotten down from the beast-drawn carriage and was standing beside Santu, swallowing his saliva before speaking.

As soon as he heard this, the two guards' faces fell, and their eyes flashed with a hint of impatience.

"You don't know what's going on in the Wasteland City and the Eight Wasteland Mountains? What are you doing here causing trouble? This place is not somewhere you can come to, hurry up and leave." One of the guards said, trying to be patient.

"Sir, we know that the Eight Wasteland Mountains are going to hold a Blood Sacrifice Conference, and we're here to participate in the grand event." Santu quickly replied.

As soon as he said this, a burst of laughter erupted from the surrounding crowd.

Another group of people, numbering around seventy or eighty, had arrived at the adjacent gate. They were all tall and muscular, with sharp horns on their heads, monkey-like faces, and wore copper armor. Their exposed hands were red as blood, and they looked at Santu with a mocking expression.

Santu only glanced at them before quickly looking away, because this group was the Qingyuan Tribe, one of the Wasteland Tribes, and also one of the most bloodthirsty and aggressive tribes in the Wasteland.

Years ago, one of the Eight Wasteland Kings, Zhu Yan, had left behind four descendants, which eventually evolved into four different tribes. Among them, the Qingyuan Tribe was the one that inherited the most of his bloodline and was the strongest.

Compared to the disdain shown to the Silver Horned Rhinoceros Tribe and the Cloud Patterned Tiger Tribe, the guards treated the Qingyuan Tribe with much more courtesy, and didn't even bother to check them before letting them pass.

"What are you still looking at? Hurry up and leave..." The guard at this gate urged Santu and Yunbao to leave.

"Sir, we've brought a descendant of the Eight True Spirit Kings' bloodline, and we have the qualifications to enter the Wasteland City." Santu said, feeling a bit helpless.

As soon as he said this, the two guards looked at each other in surprise.

"What kind of goods are you talking about, daring to mention the True Spirit King's bloodline?" A loud, thunderous voice suddenly came from the side.

Santu's heart skipped a beat as he turned to look at the speaker.

A scar-faced Qingyuan tribesman was walking towards them, his face full of anger.

"We..." Santu quickly lowered his head, trying to explain.

But before he could even finish speaking, he felt a sudden impact on his chest, and his body flew backwards, crashing into the thick city wall before sliding down, coughing up blood.

Yunbao saw this and tried to rush over to help him, but was slapped to the ground by a powerful palm wind.

The Qingyuan tribesman stepped on him, his face full of contempt, saying, "You're a lowly, insignificant tribe, and you dare to claim to be descendants of the True Spirit King? This is an insult to the Wasteland Tribes!"

Yunbao felt his gallbladder being trampled, and he couldn't even speak, his mouth opening and closing in silence.

This Qingyuan tribesman was as powerful as a Taiyi-stage cultivator, and they were no match for him.

"You're going to die, you've sullied my foot..." The Qingyuan tribesman spat, his face full of disgust, and raised his foot to crush Yunbao's head.

The surrounding crowd of onlookers, numbering in the hundreds, didn't even try to stop him, and instead seemed to be enjoying the bloody spectacle.

Santu struggled to get up, but was held back by the two guards.

"Earlier, we told you to leave, now don't go and get yourself killed..." one of the guards whispered in his ear.

But Santu didn't care, his eyes flashing with anger, his body suddenly growing several times larger, a massive black stone axe appearing in his hand.

However, before he could even move, the two guards suddenly grew in size, their long spears crossing to press against Santu's neck, saying, "You want to die, but don't drag us down with you."

At this moment, the Qingyuan tribesman's foot was about to crush Yunbao's head, and it was clear that he was going to kill him.

Just as Yunbao was about to meet his end, the people from the two tribes, who had been following them, charged forward, ready to die to save their leader.

But just as they were about to attack, a faint voice came from the beast-drawn carriage:

"You dare to try and crush him?"

The voice was soft, but it was clear and loud, and it made everyone pause, looking at the speaker in surprise.
"What person is hiding in the carriage, pretending to be a ghost? I'll step on it, how's that?"

The Qingyuan tribe's person's movements slightly paused, and then a sneer appeared on the corner of his mouth. He heavily stepped down.

Suddenly, a loud thunderous sound echoed, and a silver electric wrapped blue figure shot out from the carriage, instantly appearing in front of the Qingyuan tribe's person.

Before he could even react, a burst of thunder exploded, and the Qingyuan tribe's person's body flew backward in an instant, crashing into the black city wall, causing the entire wall to shake violently.

The surrounding people were shocked by the sudden scene, and their eyes all gathered on the blue figure.

It was naturally Han Li, who had appeared to save Yunbao's life.

Han Li slowly bent down, picked up Yunbao, and handed him a blue pill. His eyebrows were furrowed as he looked at the two soldiers holding Shantu.

They saw Han Li's attitude and knew not to mess with him, so they quickly let go.

Shantu also stumbled back, returning to Han Li.

Han Li took out another pill and gave it to Shantu, then turned his gaze to the Qingyuan tribe's person.

The Qingyuan tribe's person was born with a strong physique, and the thick city wall, which was reinforced with array formations, had been cracked open by his crash. He didn't seem to have suffered any injuries, and after dusting himself off, he stood stably.

However, Han Li didn't want to make a big deal out of the situation and didn't use his true bloodline power. Instead, he suppressed his spiritual energy and maintained a calm demeanor, staring at the Qingyuan tribe's person.

"Lei Peng's tribe... are those two your subordinates?" The Qingyuan tribe's person didn't attack again, seemingly wary of Lei Peng's tribe, and asked instead.

Like the Qingyuan tribe, Lei Peng's tribe was also one of the eight true spirits of the barbarian tribes, and they were descendants of the Heavenly Crane Peng. Although they were slightly weaker than the Qingyuan tribe, they had a strong and protective tribe leader.

In history, whenever Lei Peng's tribe's younger generation was bullied, the tribe leader would personally take action and demand justice.

"We're just entering the city, do we need to go to such lengths?" Han Li didn't answer, instead asking calmly.

"Lei Peng's tribe, I know many of them. Are you daring to tell me your name?" The Qingyuan tribe's person's eyebrows furrowed, and he said.

"Can we enter the city now?" Han Li ignored him and turned to ask the two soldiers.

"Of course, of course, please..." One of the soldiers nodded hastily and said.

Han Li waved his hand, and the two tribesmen quickly helped Shantu and Yunbao onto the beast carriage, preparing to enter the city.

"Lei Peng's tribe doesn't have anyone like you, could you be a mixed-blood from a branch tribe? You're not qualified to participate in the grand meeting, scram!" The Qingyuan tribe's person's anger finally boiled over, and he shouted loudly.

For the barbarian tribes, bloodline was extremely important, and being called a "mixed-blood" was enough to make someone fight to the death.

Han Li, however, was not from the barbarian tribes, and being called a mixed-blood didn't affect him much. He just wanted to enter the city smoothly and then head to the Eight Wastes Mountain to rescue Xiao Bai. He didn't get angry, instead turning to walk towards the carriage.

However, his actions seemed like he was acknowledging defeat, and the surrounding people began to jeer and shout for them to leave.

Seeing this, the Qingyuan tribe's person became even more arrogant, convinced that Han Li was just a branch tribe mixed-blood. He took a step forward, reaching out to grab Han Li's back.

"Dog mixed-blood! You want to enter this gate? First, you have to get past me!"

As he stepped forward, the black stone ground suddenly cracked, and a giant hand burst out, reaching for Han Li's back.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed slightly, and he let out a silent sigh. It seemed he couldn't avoid this.

As he thought this, his body suddenly turned, and his five fingers curled into an eagle claw shape. He turned to face the Qingyuan tribe's person and grabbed towards him.

His bloodline power and star power simultaneously erupted, and a silver electric light burst forth, forming a giant Lei Peng claw. The two clashed, and a thunderous explosion shook the air.

A powerful gust of wind burst forth, sweeping sideways and forcing the surrounding people to retreat.

Layer upon layer of silver electric light exploded, and fist-sized balls of lightning shot out, forcing the onlookers to stumble backward.

The beasts pulling the carriages were startled, and they too began to roar and struggle, causing chaos in the surroundings.

The Qingyuan tribe's person was shocked, as Lei Peng's tribe was known for their speed, but their strength was not weak either. However, Han Li had met him head-on with brute force, and it seemed he was not at a disadvantage. This was unexpected.
