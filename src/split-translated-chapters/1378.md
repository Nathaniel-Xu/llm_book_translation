The Jade Pool's victory.

Explosive sounds echoed in the void, the Demon Master stood suspended in mid-air, his hands clenched into a fist, his body radiating intense spatial fluctuations. In front of him, 81 black, sharp cones floated in the void, their symbols flashing with a faint glow.

"Go!"

The Demon Master's voice boomed, his palms thrust forward.

The 81 black cones shot out instantly, disappearing into the void.

The next moment, a dull, thunderous sound shook the nine heavens, the 81 black cones transforming into 81 colossal pillars, encircling the chaotic vortex, forming a massive spatial array that sealed it within.

The spatial array's perimeter was surrounded by a visible spatial rift, as if a chunk of the heavens had been carved out, disconnecting it from the world, forming an independent space.

The Demon Clan's method of creating the Demon Domain was similar, but it wasn't achieved through the Demon Master's power alone. Instead, it was done by gathering the collective strength of the entire Demon Clan, with the Demon Master's power as the catalyst.

Now, the Demon Master used his 81 refined, heaven-sealing pillars as the foundation, setting up this heaven-sealing array. Although its power was inferior to creating the Demon Domain, it was sufficient to seal this area of 100,000 miles.

"The Demon Master's methods are quite impressive, attempting to isolate me, along with the Dao Ancestor's array, from the world. Unfortunately, it's still a bit too petty," Gu Huai said, sneering.

He opened his hand, and a ancient symbol appeared in his palm, pointing towards one of the heaven-sealing pillars.

The symbol burst into a brilliant, golden light, transforming into a dense, golden light pillar that shot towards the pillar, arriving in an instant.

"You won't succeed," a voice boomed.

The Wheel of Reincarnation's Master appeared in front of the pillar, forming a seal with his hand, and a circular, dark red light shield materialized before him.

The shield had six glowing orbs, each with a different color, and a symbol floated above each one.

The Time Ancestor's golden light pillar struck the shield, causing a violent shockwave, but the shield absorbed all the energy, transforming it into a soft, ethereal glow that dissipated after circulating through the six orbs.

"Wheel of Reincarnation... Annihilation," the Wheel of Reincarnation's Master said, his voice dripping with malice.

His words were followed by a burst of crimson light, as threads of law energy condensed into a tangible form, flowing through his body and into the shield.

The six symbols on the shield lit up, one by one, and the shield expanded a hundredfold, condensing into a massive, dark red energy sphere that shot towards Gu Huai.

The sphere was surrounded by a blood-red mist, containing the Wheel of Reincarnation's Master's accumulated karma from millions of years, which exploded as it approached Gu Huai.

A wave of crimson mist surged towards Gu Huai, but he had already set up a temporal barrier, freezing time for all approaching objects.

However, the mist passed through the barrier unimpeded, and Gu Huai's eyes widened in surprise.

He tried to disperse the mist with a wave of his sleeve, but it condensed into a thread, piercing his sleeve like an arrow.

In an instant, Gu Huai's body was enveloped in the mist.

He felt his body slow down, and his arm, which was controlling the array, became immobile.

"What kind of technique is this?" Gu Huai asked, looking at the Wheel of Reincarnation's Master.

"Karmic cause and effect transcends time, your temporal law can't block it... Besides, these causes and effects were created by you, under the Heavenly Court's command, I'm just collecting them and returning them to you," the Wheel of Reincarnation's Master said, smiling.

"You think this small amount of karma will make me pay the price? The Master is too naive," Gu Huai sneered.

He was surrounded by a golden glow, and golden light threads swirled around him, as if he was bathing in the river of time, washing away the karmic causes and effects.

The Wheel of Reincarnation's Master remained calm, a hint of a smile on his lips.

At the same time, he formed a seal with his hands, and a virtual symbol array appeared beneath Gu Huai's feet.

On the other side, the Demon Master also sensed the opportunity, and cast a spell.

The 81 heaven-sealing pillars radiated intense light, and 81 black, crystal chains shot out, binding Gu Huai in place.

The chains restricted Gu Huai's space, and the flow of time around him stagnated.

"Look at you now..." the Demon Master said, his voice dripping with malice.

Gu Huai's body was suddenly enveloped in a dark, shadowy aura, as the hidden, Heavenly Demon Ancestor's form materialized behind him, growing to dozens of feet in length, and wrapping around Gu Huai's body.

"I'll take your soul, To the Heavenly Demon," the Heavenly Demon Ancestor said, his face twisted into a cruel smile.

After witnessing the Time Ancestor's sinister plot, he had agreed to join forces with the Wheel of Reincarnation's Master, who would restrain Gu Huai, while he would devour Gu Huai's soul.
As long as Gu Huo or Jin's divine soul was successfully devoured, even Yin Ming couldn't imagine the extent of his own power's explosive growth. Preventing the Time Ancestor's plan wouldn't be difficult, and taking down the Wheel of Rebirth's master and the Demon Master at the same time was also not impossible.

Just thinking about destroying the people who stood at the pinnacle of the three great ultimate laws made Yin Ming's heart excited and unbearable.

He raised his body high and suddenly charged forward, diving headfirst into Gu Huo's eyebrow.

As long as he entered the realm of the mind, Gu Huo would be utterly defeated.

A sound like a bronze bell ringing suddenly came from Gu Huo's eyebrow, and a wave of golden ripples surged out from his mind, colliding with Yin Ming.

Yin Ming felt his entire body heat up, and his essence was burning uncontrollably.

"No, impossible..." Yin Ming was suddenly panicked, his body flashing with light as he tried to fly away from Gu Huo.

But at that moment, a large hand had already broken free from its restraints and grabbed Yin Ming's throat.

"I've walked further down the path of exploring the great way than all of you combined, you shouldn't have underestimated me so much," Gu Huo said slowly.

As he spoke, a power that was completely different from before flowed out from his palm, like a golden grinding wheel that rotated violently, grinding Yin Ming's body into dust and dispersing it into the air.

At the same time, the layer of blood-colored mist covering his body peeled off, piece by piece, like old paint, and dispersed into the air without touching the ground.

The Wheel of Rebirth's master saw this and opened his palm, releasing a drop of essence blood that flowed into his palm, and his body erupted with light.

In response, the virtual light array beneath Gu Huo's feet suddenly burst into light, surging upwards.

The array of light seemed to open a doorway to the underworld, revealing a blood-colored space, and a voice that sounded like a scream echoed out.

 Inside, countless blood-colored figures were climbing up the doorway, but no matter how hard they tried, they couldn't climb out.

And within the doorway, there was a powerful force that was pulling Gu Huo, trying to drag him in.

"Child's play..."

Gu Huo muttered, pointing downwards, and a spiral of gray light descended from the chaotic vortex above, striking the doorway.

The blood-colored space inside was suddenly disrupted by a powerful force, and the countless blood-colored figures were crushed into dust, rising up in a spiral along with the gray light, merging into the chaotic vortex.

The vortex, which had stopped expanding, suddenly burst forth again.

The Wheel of Rebirth's master saw this and his expression turned solemn, his hands changing the spell, and the array of light began to shrink, the blood-colored doorway disappearing.

The Demon Master saw this and exchanged a glance with the Wheel of Rebirth's master, both of their eyes filled with complex emotions.

"You finally seem to know fear..." Gu Huo smiled, raising his hand, and the crystal chains binding him suddenly withered and broke, turning into dust.

"This great array contains the power of the primordial laws, which existed since the beginning of the world, and is the true creation law, far older than the three great ultimate laws. You can say that the heavenly laws were born from the chaos. So, do you think using spatial laws to isolate it would be effective?" Gu Huo asked with a smile.

The Demon Master's expression turned extremely ugly upon hearing this.

The next instant, the chaotic vortex above the three of them suddenly erupted with a thunderous sound, and the vortex expanded violently, swallowing the 81 pillars of heaven.

"The time has come, none of you can stop it, let's welcome the arrival of this new era together," Gu Huo declared loudly.

"Rumble rumble rumble..."

The sound of thunder continued to echo, the vortex expanding, its edge breaking through the void, and the gray light engulfing everything.

The entire Tian Gong continent, the flow of spiritual energy in the void, became chaotic in an instant, and all the laws seemed to be disrupted, the rules of the world's operation being broken.

The already broken Yao Chi paradise, which had been suspended in mid-air, was now plummeting downwards, and before it could land, it began to disintegrate, breaking apart in mid-air.

Li Yuan and the others, who had survived, stabilized their bodies and flew down towards the ground.

But before they could land, the Tian Gong continent began to split apart, creating endless canyons and fissures, and all the volcanoes erupted violently, the land's edges collapsing, and the sea retreating.

"Enjoy the final scenery of the old world..." Gu Huo said, his eyes filled with madness.

The Demon Master sighed, his brow furrowed, looking at the Wheel of Rebirth's master.

The latter's expression was also difficult to look at, but his eyes still held a thoughtful gaze, as if he hadn't given up yet.
