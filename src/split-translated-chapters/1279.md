Han Li felt his body uncontrollably plummeting downwards, his mind racing as he fully activated the Time Laws, mobilizing all his internal strength to stabilize his body.

But the surrounding forces were too great, he felt like a withered leaf in a raging river, completely at the mercy of the currents as he was swept towards the unknown darkness.

The force initially plunged straight down, but soon twisted and turned, pulling Han Li's body left and right, leaving him disoriented and dizzy.

Later on, he gave up struggling and only protected his vital areas, while extending his divine sense to probe the changing surroundings and try to lock onto Jintong and Ti Hu.

Fortunately, he could still sense the direction of Jintong and Ti Hu, although it was somewhat erratic, as if they were sometimes near and sometimes far.

After who-knew-how-long, Han Li's body suddenly sank, as if he had crashed onto the ground.

Immediately, two loud thuds were heard, and two bodies heavily crashed onto Han Li's, namely Jintong and Ti Hu.

Ti Hu was fine, but Jintong's body was as hard as an iron lump, and he crashed onto Han Li, making him see stars.

"Master, are you okay?" Ti Hu hastily stood up.

"Uncle, I didn't mean to!" Jintong silently stood up, his eyes flashing with a hint of apology.

"No worries, fortunately, my body is robust. By the way, take a look, what is this place?" Han Li waved his hand, standing up to look around.

The three of them were now standing in a desolate wasteland, the sky was pitch black, and the light was extremely dim. Except for the area within twenty li, which could be barely seen, further away it was a dark and endless expanse, completely invisible.

The surrounding winds howled, and the eerie ghostly cries could be heard at any moment, the cold winds biting, and the yin-cold energy was omnipresent, several times more intense than the Fallen Wind.

Han Li and Jintong furrowed their brows, each activating their Law powers to protect their bodies, only then could they resist the invasion of the surrounding yin-cold energy.

But Ti Hu, on the other hand, not only didn't feel uncomfortable, but instead felt extremely comfortable with the dense yin-cold ghostly energy.

"Looking at the situation, this should be the Underworld Realm, after all the trouble we went through, we finally arrived." Ti Hu rubbed his belly, saying with certainty.

"This is indeed the Underworld Realm." Han Li nodded thoughtfully.

Although he didn't think Ti Hu had been to the Underworld Realm before, he somehow felt that Ti Hu's judgment wouldn't be wrong.

"Regardless, the commotion we made earlier probably caught the attention of some existences in this place, who knows what dangers are here, it's better to change locations first." Jintong reminded.

Han Li and Ti Hu naturally didn't object.

The surroundings were all the same, the three of them briefly discussed and randomly chose a direction, quickly flying away.

Han Li and the others had just left for less than half a stick of incense when over a dozen black shadows flew in from the distance, appearing to be half-human, half-beast ghostly creatures, with a different appearance from the Soul Reapers and the black-robed middle-aged man's ghostly soldiers.

These half-human, half-beast ghostly creatures surrounded the area where the three had landed, sniffing heavily, their faces filled with excitement.

Then, over a dozen of these ghostly creatures took to the air, chasing after Han Li and the others, with only one remaining behind, letting out a sharp, ear-piercing cry.

A moment later, a massive black cloud appeared on the horizon, rapidly flying towards them.

Within the cloud, countless ghostly creatures flew in, densely packed, their numbers unknown, all flying towards Han Li and the others' direction.

Han Li and the others flew forward in silence, due to the unfamiliar environment and the uncertainty of their safety, they didn't fly too fast.

Han Li flew while dispersing his divine sense to probe the surroundings, simultaneously activating his Nine Underworld Devil Eyes, shooting out two purple beams of light, looking forward.

The yin-cold energy in the void was too dense, greatly affecting his divine sense's expansion, only able to barely expand to a hundred li, further away his divine sense would be unable to proceed.

On the other hand, his Nine Underworld Devil Eyes could see much farther, but only up to five hundred li.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, a distance of five hundred li seemed insignificant, but for cultivators of their level, it was essentially nothing, they could fly there in the blink of an eye.

"Master, there's a large river about a thousand li ahead, it looks very unusual." Ti Hu suddenly spoke up.

"A thousand li away? Ti Hu, how far can you probe?" Han Li's eyes flashed, asking.

"The yin-cold ghostly energy here is too dense, affecting my divine sense greatly, I can probe up to two thousand li with full force." Ti Hu calculated, saying.

"Jintong, how about you?" Han Li looked at Jintong.

"I'm not good at probing, I can only see up to seventy or eighty li... Uncle, what's wrong, if I'm not mistaken, this is the first time you've asked about my divine sense range." Jintong asked curiously.

"Nothing, I can only see up to five hundred li, far inferior to you, Ti Hu, you're in charge of scouting." Han Li said to Ti Hu.

"Perhaps it's related to my physique... I don't know why, but I feel a sense of familiarity with this place... No problem, I'll take care of it." Ti Hu patted his chest, saying.

A distance of a thousand li was traversed in the blink of an eye, and the three of them soon arrived near the black river Ti Hu had mentioned.

The black river was extremely large, Han Li's line of sight couldn't even see its edges, the river's waves were turbulent, churning up black waves that flowed downstream.
But it was strange that the river water had a majestic and vast momentum, yet not a single sound was emitted, making it seem extremely eerie.

 Thin wisps of black mist rose from the river and floated into the air, drifting towards the sky.

Above the river, hundreds of feet in the air, a thick layer of black clouds floated, seemingly condensed from the mist in the river. Faintly visible within the clouds were flashes of black lightning, giving off an ominous feeling.

Han Li and the others stopped at the riverbank, not daring to proceed.

"Tixi, can you detect the other side of the river?" Han Li asked.

Tixi's eyes flashed with a layer of black light as she gazed forward, shaking her head quickly. "No, I can't see the edge."

"This black river is so vast and flowing, yet why is there no sound at all? I'll try!" Jin Tong said, raising his hand.

A hundred-foot-long golden light shot out, slashing into the river, but it was silent and didn't even create a ripple.

The three of them watched, their brows furrowed.

Jin Tong's golden light seemed ordinary, but it contained a considerable amount of power, enough to easily cleave a mountain peak. Yet, it didn't even react when it struck the river.

"This river contains a massive amount of ghost energy, and it has a strong corrosive effect. It's best not to get contaminated," Tixi said, looking at the black river.

"Uncle, what should we do now? Should we try to cross the black river or follow the riverbank?" Jin Tong asked Han Li.

Han Li hesitated for a moment, then snapped his fingers.

A golden light flew out from his sleeve, transforming into a golden bean that quickly grew to the size of a person. It transformed into a golden Dao soldier.

"Go!" Han Li pointed again, and a golden lightning bolt shot out, merging into the Dao soldier's body.

The golden Dao soldier's body was surrounded by golden lightning patterns, and its aura increased several times. It flew towards the other side of the black river.

But before it could fly far, a loud rumble came from the black clouds, and a bolt of black lightning as thick as a bowl dropped down, striking the golden Dao soldier.

The Dao soldier's body immediately turned black, and all its spiritual energy fluctuations disappeared. It fell into the black river like a stone.

The river suddenly churned, and countless eerie ghostly wails filled the air.

Numerous terrifying snake-like creatures emerged from the black river, engulfing the Dao soldier. Accompanied by hair-raising roars, the Dao soldier's body disintegrated into countless pieces, which were then devoured by the snake-like creatures.

Han Li and the others watched, their faces changing.

The snake-like creatures glared at the three of them, seeming to want to devour them as well. However, they didn't attack, instead diving back into the water and disappearing.

The black river quickly returned to its calm state, flowing silently as if nothing had happened.

"Looks like crossing this river won't be easy," Jin Tong said, looking worried.

"The black lightning in the clouds seems to have a corrosive effect on spiritual energy. Even if we're struck, it won't be pleasant. Let's follow the river for a while and see what happens. Ah, Tixi, that Yama's Cauldron had a guiding effect earlier. Let's take it out and see," Han Li said, suddenly remembering something.

"Ah, I almost forgot about it," Tixi said, her eyes lighting up as she took out the Yama's Cauldron.

The Yama's Cauldron floated quietly in front of Tixi, radiating a light several times brighter than usual. It seemed to be resonating with the eerie ghost energy in the area, but it didn't provide any further guidance.

"Looks like this cauldron only sensed the energy in this area and guided us here. It doesn't have any deeper significance," Tixi said, sighing.

However, Han Li didn't seem disappointed. "But considering the cauldron's reaction, it's likely that it originated from this place or has some other deeper connection... In any case, I think we're in the right place."

Since the Yama's Cauldron belonged to this place, it was likely that the Yama's Manor was also here.

"Master is right, so let's explore this place," Tixi said, nodding.

The three of them discussed and decided to head upstream.

Just as they were about to move, Tixi's expression suddenly changed.

"Bad, a large group of ghostly creatures is flying towards us!"

Tixi's voice had barely fallen when a loud rumble echoed from the horizon, and countless ghostly creatures swarmed towards them, their ferocious energy sending shivers down one's spine.

The air was filled with ear-piercing wails and screams.

"Prepare for battle!"

Han Li's eyes flashed, and his body was suddenly surrounded by a brilliant golden light. Thirty-six Qingtian Sword Shadows appeared around him, each one surrounded by thick golden lightning.
