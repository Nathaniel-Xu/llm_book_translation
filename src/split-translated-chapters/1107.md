"Go!"

Lei Yu Ce's voice thundered out, and the symbols on the ground beneath him burst into radiance. The sound of sharp, piercing clangs echoed out, and one after another, golden swords shot out from the ground, their tips pointing towards the sky. Suddenly, flames erupted...

These swords were different from the illusory sword shadows that had appeared earlier. All of them were genuine flying swords, and there were a total of thirty-six of them. Each sword had symbols etched onto its body, and within those symbols, threads of golden attribute law energy were hidden.

Lei Yu Ce's hands formed a sword seal, and the golden flying swords on the ground began to vibrate violently. The golden light on the swords' bodies surged, and countless threads of golden sword energy burst forth, like a tidal wave crashing upwards into the sky.

In the sky above, the two dark yellow giant swords' oppressive force had already been greatly hindered. Now, as the dense sword energy surged upwards, the earth attribute law energy within the giant swords was finally exhausted.

A loud rumbling sound echoed out, and the two dark yellow giant swords shattered simultaneously, dissolving into a halo of light.

Lei Yu Ce saw this and exchanged a smile with Su Xi.

However, before the two of them could relax, a muffled sound echoed out from the heavens above.

"It seems that if we don't break this sword array, the attacks won't stop," Lei Yu Ce said, his eyes flashing with insight.

"The sword array's diagram should be somewhere within the array. You go and search for it, and I'll hold off the attacks here," Su Xi said, after a moment's thought.

"This sword array's power is not to be underestimated. You alone might not be able to..."

Lei Yu Ce's words were cut off by Su Xi's icy tone. "Are you looking down on the Tian Shui Sect, or are you looking down on me?"

Lei Yu Ce's face turned red as he stuttered, "H-how could I dare..."

Su Xi's expression relaxed, and a rare smile appeared on her face. "You can go and search for the diagram. I'll take care of things here."

Lei Yu Ce still looked worried, but he could only nod and say, "Alright, I'll go and search for the diagram. You be careful, Su Xi."

Su Xi's expression returned to normal, and she said softly, "You be careful too, Lei DaoFriend."

Lei Yu Ce's heart swelled with joy, and he nodded heavily before turning to head towards the center of the array. The pressure on his body was immense, but he felt as light as a feather, and his footsteps were quick and carefree.

Above, the heavens' gate was still open, and the dark yellow flying swords continued to fall from the sky at irregular intervals. The people trapped within the array, including Jiao San and the others, were not having an easy time.

However, Han Li felt that things had become much easier for him.

Because of the other people's entry into the array, the sword array had to divide its power to attack everyone, and the pressure on Han Li's body had decreased significantly.

At this moment, he was using his full strength to activate his true spirit blood vessels and operate the Tian Xia Zhen Yu Gong. The six giant arms on his body each grasped a Qing Zhu Feng Yun sword, and he was swinging them continuously, using the sword energy to blast open a path through the dark yellow giant swords that were falling from the sky.

According to his previous guesses, the sword array's core location was likely to be in the center of the array, which was also the most difficult place to approach. If he could find that location, he would have a chance to break open the sword array.

As the sword energy continued to burst forth, the surrounding void suddenly erupted into a chaotic light, and a whirlwind appeared out of nowhere, sweeping towards the four directions.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and his brow furrowed.

But then, his eyes flashed with purple light, and his nine-yin magic pupils began to rotate, observing the surroundings.

However, under his spiritual vision, the surroundings did not change at all. The chaotic light continued to swirl, and the dark yellow giant swords in the sky above continued to fall towards him.

Han Li's heart tightened, and he could only divide his attention between searching for a path and defending against the sword array's attacks.

He silently recited the incantation for the Lian Shen Shu, and he used his full strength to turn his spiritual energy towards the surroundings, searching for any clues.

But the result was still nothing.

In this Su Yue Tower, spiritual energy was already being suppressed, and in this sword array, the suppression was even stronger. Han Li's spiritual energy could only sense the earth attribute law energy in the surroundings, and nothing else.

He felt anxious, but he had no choice. He could only rely on his intuition to move forward.

As he walked, the invisible pressure around him grew stronger, and the pressure on his body increased by more than tenfold compared to when he first entered the sword array.

Every step Han Li took, the ground beneath his feet would crack and split, leaving behind a deep impression.

And with every fall of the dark yellow giant swords, the pressure on Han Li's body grew even greater.
"What a magnificent sword array, even if a Da Luo cultivator were to charge in, if they couldn't find the correct way to break the array, they would be worn down to death...". Han Li's throat moved slightly, and his mouth felt a bit bitter, he spat out a mouthful of saliva and said.

As he walked to this place, although he seemed to be unharmed, his internal organs were actually being severely compressed. If he couldn't find a way to break the array and leave soon, he would eventually be in danger of losing his life.

After advancing with great difficulty for several hundred feet, Han Li left behind a long string of deep footprints embedded in the ground.

As soon as he finished speaking, he seemed to suddenly remember something, and no longer focused on advancing in a straight line. Instead, he gathered his spirit and no longer used his eyes as a guide, and began to move in different directions with his eyes closed.

He didn't walk much each time, only about ten steps, before retreating back to the starting point, and then walking out in another direction, and retreating again, changing direction and starting anew.

After several rounds of this, a large area of deep footprints appeared around him, covering a radius of several dozen feet.

When Han Li finally retreated back to the starting point, his tightly closed eyes slowly opened, and he let out a long breath. His gaze fell on one of the directions indicated by the footprints, and a hint of a smile appeared on his face.

The sword array was indeed chaotic, with the surrounding heaven and earth filled with the power of the earth attribute laws. However, even if the laws of the earth attribute were present in the heaven and earth, there was still a certain flow and rhythm to them.

If the eye of the array or the axis of the array were in a certain position, the density of the laws of the earth attribute would also change. Therefore, Han Li had walked in all directions to observe the changes in the laws of the earth attribute as he moved.

As expected, in the direction to his right front, left front, and right back, Han Li felt the power of the earth attribute laws growing stronger as he walked further.

However, the changes in the right front and left front directions were far less intense than those in the right back direction.

Han Li's thoughts turned quickly, and he guessed that there should be an array eye in the right front and left front directions, and the axis of the array should be in the right back direction.

As soon as he had this thought, Han Li swung his six arms in a row, using the last bit of spiritual energy to strike down the yellow giant sword that was falling from the sky, and then turned around to head in the right back direction.

Although the general direction was now clear, the sword array was still extremely chaotic, and the power of the earth attribute laws was affecting the surrounding directions, making it seem like they were constantly changing. Han Li could only walk for a dozen steps before stopping to reorient himself.

After several rounds of this, the ground was left with a series of deep footprints, and finally, a eight-sided altar appeared in Han Li's field of vision.

Han Li walked closer, and his gaze fell on the eight-sided altar at the center of the sword array. He saw that the edges of the altar were inlaid with eight yellow goose egg stones, which contained the power of the earth attribute laws.

On each edge of the altar, a stone sword was inserted, like eight loyal generals guarding the altar, surrounding the eight-sided jade plate that was floating in mid-air.

The jade plate didn't have any power of the earth attribute laws, but instead had a series of complex patterns engraved on it, which seemed to be some kind of talisman.

As soon as Han Li approached, the eight-sided jade plate lit up with a blue light, and the white jade plate turned a dark green color. The goose egg stones on the altar also lit up.

Immediately after, Han Li heard a sound of swords ringing out from the eight stone swords on the altar.

His heart moved slightly, and his eight arms moved like a wheel of wind and fire, striking down the dark yellow giant sword that was falling from above.

Taking advantage of the brief moment before the next attack, Han Li's body suddenly flashed, and he rushed towards the altar.

With the support of the True Speech Treasure Wheel, Han Li's speed increased greatly, but due to the spatial pressure, he was still unable to move as quickly as he could outside the array.

Fortunately, the altar was in a special location, and within a radius of thirty feet, the dark yellow flying swords would not fall from the sky, otherwise they would destroy the axis of the array.

As Han Li approached the altar, he heard a sound of swords ringing out, and the eight stone swords on the altar suddenly shot up, their surfaces rippling with yellow light, and flew towards Han Li.

The eight stone swords seemed to be separate from the rest of the array, and were only there to guard the altar. Their movement was different from the rest of the array, and their speed was extremely fast.

As the flying swords flew out, they emitted a dark yellow light, and a series of illusory sword shadows split off from the swords, which then condensed into thousands of flying swords.

The power of the earth attribute laws was present on each of the flying swords, and their fluctuations were almost identical, making it impossible to distinguish which ones were the original physical flying swords.

Han Li saw this, and his body flashed with light as he returned to his human form. He made a sword gesture with his hand, and the thirty-six Cyan Bamboo Bee Cloud Swords on his body emitted a bright light, unfolding like a fan.

The Cyan Bamboo Bee Cloud Swords emitted a powerful sword energy, and a series of sword shadows burst forth from the swords, blooming in front of Han Li.
