"Alright, if it weren't for the fact that I have some acquaintance with your master, you'd be a dead man by now. Fortunately, you still have some integrity and didn't humiliate our Jiumen Pavilion's reputation in front of bandits. Go stand aside for now." Miao Fa Xian Zun said in a low voice, reprimanding him.

Lan Yan immediately stood up and stood behind the crystal throne, standing upright with his hands clasped together. However, his eyes gazed at Han Li with a hint of concern.

On the other side, the female servant who had thrown the fan at Lan Yan had already caught up, and with a swift swing of her fan, a burst of green wind swept towards Han Li.

Han Li dodged the wind while avoiding the treasure umbrella, but he didn't have time to evade the wind. As it approached, he didn't dodge or avoid it, instead, he directly faced it head-on.

Just as the wind was about to strike him, the True Speech Treasure Wheel in his body suddenly reversed, attempting to use the wind's momentum to escape quickly.

When he realized that his opponent could approach him so closely without being detected, Han Li was certain that his opponent's strength was far beyond his own, so he didn't have the idea of fighting back to the death. He only wanted to escape as quickly as possible.

However, when he came into contact with the green wind, he suddenly felt something was off.

Han Li felt his body become light, as if his bones had become numb, and he didn't rush away as he expected. Instead, he was lifted by the wind and involuntarily flew upwards.

At the same time, the treasure umbrella above his head descended, releasing a powerful attractive force that directly pulled Han Li's body into it.

As soon as he approached, he was bound by the symbol chains on the umbrella handle and tied to it.

The umbrella's surface closed, and with a "whoosh", it enveloped Han Li's entire body.

Han Li, trapped inside, felt his body's spiritual energy being completely sealed, and he couldn't muster any strength.

The female servant who had thrown the fan saw this and stretched out her hand, and the green umbrella, which had already closed, shrunk in size and flew back to her. She grasped it with both hands and held it in her arms.

The female servant who had thrown the fan also turned around and returned to her position.

"It's so easy to capture him..." Lan Yan watched the scene, and for a moment, he couldn't believe it.

"A mere thief like you, and you two siblings couldn't even take him down together. You even lost a servant, what a joke!" Miao Fa Xian Zun sneered, saying.

Lan Yan's throat moved slightly, but he didn't say anything.

At this moment, the female servant who had been holding the treasure umbrella suddenly frowned and looked down at it.

The umbrella's surface was fluctuating, as if Han Li was struggling inside.

"Even a Great Luo Immortal can't escape from my master's Town Yuan Luo Heaven Umbrella. What makes you think you can struggle out?" she mocked.

However, as soon as she finished speaking, she let out a cry of surprise and threw the umbrella away.

A wisp of blue smoke emerged from the umbrella's surface, and a small hole was burnt out. A cluster of seven-colored flames protruded from the hole, resembling a seven-colored flower.

The flames suddenly shot upwards, and a small silver flame person emerged from the hole. It stretched its arms and expanded its body, transforming into a giant silver flame bird.

As it spread its wings, a burst of intense flames shot out, flying towards Miao Fa Xian Zun and the others.

The female servant who had thrown the fan saw this and swiftly waved her fan, dispersing the flames.

At the same time, Han Li's figure emerged from the umbrella and flashed away, fleeing towards the distance.

The silver flame bird followed closely behind, transforming into a silver flame that shot forward.

"Hmm, it seems that the flame bird that ingested the seven-colored fire sand is quite rare... but wanting to escape from my grasp is still a foolish dream." Miao Fa Xian Zun watched Han Li flee, but she didn't rush to chase him. Instead, she stood up slowly and said.

As soon as she finished speaking, her slender hands clasped together in front of her, and her palms flashed with a crystalline light, becoming transparent and ice-like.

"Condense"

Her lips moved slightly, and a faint white mist emerged from her mouth.

In an instant, the surrounding air within a radius of tens of thousands of miles froze, and a thin layer of mist spread out, causing the entire space to become icy.

Han Li had already fled tens of thousands of miles away, but as he sensed the changes in the surrounding air, he didn't dare to hesitate. He quickly absorbed the silver flame bird into his body and accelerated his speed, fleeing even faster.

However, as the sounds of the freezing air grew louder, a massive ice crystal wall suddenly rose from the ground, blocking his path and piercing the sky.

Han Li's mind moved, and he activated the Tianxia Town Prison Technique, causing his body's spiritual energy to surge. His hands shone with a bright light, and he punched the ice crystal wall with all his might.

The sound of the impact was deafening!

Han Li's fist glowed with a white light, and the ice crystal wall cracked, releasing a massive amount of energy.
The entire ice crystal city wall shook violently, and the center of the wall suddenly sank, with ring-shaped cracks spreading outward from the point where Han Li's fist had struck. However, the majestic city wall somehow withstood the impact, not shattering or collapsing.

Han Li's heart was filled with anxiety, and he wanted to add another punch to break through the wall. But his face suddenly changed.

Above the sky, snowflakes began to swirl and dance, and a whirlwind blew a cluster of snowflakes onto the city wall. A faint white light flashed, and a slender green figure appeared, revealing the majestic figure of Miaofa Xianzun.

As soon as her feet touched the city wall, a layer of white light spread across the wall, and the cracks on the wall began to heal. Within a few breaths, the wall had returned to its original state.

"You can't escape from my spiritual domain," Miaofa Xianzun said coldly, looking down at Han Li. "Surrender, and you'll suffer less."

Han Li ignored her words and rapidly reversed the rotation of his True Speech Treasure Wheel. As he did so, his body shape shifted, and his hands quickly formed a series of hand seals, preparing to summon the Thunder Array technique to escape.

However, before the thunderous light could appear, a massive six-sided snowflake ice crystal enveloped Han Li, its blue crystal light flashing. Six blue rays of light shot out from the crystal, and Han Li found himself surrounded by six white crystal walls.

The crystal walls emitted a intense cold aura, and Han Li's thunderous light was extinguished. The space around him seemed to freeze, and his connection to the surrounding environment was severed.

At the same time, the crystal walls flashed white, and a layer of light appeared on their surface, transforming them into six silver mirrors.

Each mirror reflected an image of Han Li, but with different expressions and movements. Some were cold and unforgiving, while others smiled or ignored him.

Han Li's eyes flashed with purple light as he used his Nine Yin Magic Eyes to examine the mirrors. However, he found that the images were mere illusions, lacking any spiritual energy.

Convinced that the mirrors were just illusions, Han Li's heart calmed, and he activated his Heaven's Wrath technique. He raised his fist and struck one of the mirrors.

However, as he did so, the images on the mirrors also moved, swinging their fists at Han Li. "You think these illusions can stop me?" Han Li roared.

His arm shook, and his fist struck the mirror with increased force. The mirror shattered, but the other mirrors responded by unleashing a barrage of fists, each one striking Han Li with tremendous force.

Han Li's body shook violently, and his bones felt like they were being shattered. The mirrors' cold aura intensified, and his body began to freeze.

Han Li's eyes flashed with determination, and he activated his Heaven's Wrath technique and True Spirit Bloodline. His body suddenly expanded, transforming into a three-headed, six-armed demon.

"Break!" Han Li roared, his three heads and six arms striking the mirrors with incredible force.

The mirrors shattered, and a massive energy burst forth, causing the surrounding environment to shake. However, the mirrors quickly repaired themselves, and the illusions resumed their attack.

Han Li's body was battered by the relentless assault, and he stumbled backward, his vision blurring. The mirrors' cold aura intensified, and his body began to freeze.

As the illusions continued to attack, Han Li's body began to weaken. He realized that he couldn't break through the mirrors and decided to retreat.

Miaofa Xianzun's voice echoed outside, "You can't break my ice-sealed mirrors with your current cultivation. Surrender, and I'll spare your life."

Han Li's body slumped, and he sat on the ground, motionless. He knew that he couldn't defeat the mirrors and could only wait for an opportunity to escape.
