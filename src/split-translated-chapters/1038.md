After Ti Hu left, Han Li didn't delay and flew up to the spiritual field.

He stood suspended in mid-air, gazing down at the earth.

Below, he saw that half of the spiritual herbs in the spiritual field had been harvested, and most of the remaining ones were over a hundred thousand years old, but not yet a million years old.

Han Li's eyes swept over the area, and he chose a spot with a dense concentration of spiritual herbs and a rich spiritual energy. He flew down to the edge of the field and walked quickly around it, stomping his foot on the ground as he went. The force of his stomp was not visible, but the ground would sink slightly, revealing a fissure like a knife cut.

After he finished walking around the field, the area of about ten mu was completely sunken, looking like it had been separated from the surrounding land.

Han Li then squatted down, rolled up his sleeves, and inserted his hands into the fissure along the edge of the field. A patch of blue light emerged from his palms, extending underground and enveloping the entire field.

He then let out a low shout: "Rise!"

The field responded to his voice, and he lifted it up with his hands, holding it like a large piece of cloth, and carried it towards the silver light gate.

Not far away, Ti Hu was directing the giant ape puppets to gather the spiritual herbs. Seeing Han Li lift the field with such ease, she couldn't help but laugh.

"If I had known, I would have just moved the whole thing!" she sighed.

Han Li arrived at the silver light gate, and with a slight hook of his finger, the gate expanded, swallowing him and the field whole.

Inside the gate, the field was connected to the cave heaven spiritual field. Han Li walked to the edge of the field and found a spacious area to place the field.

He had considered moving all the fields inside, but the cave heaven's space was limited, and he couldn't use it all for the fields. Besides, he had already searched the entire secret realm and collected all the spiritual treasures and artifacts from the buildings.

To store these treasures, Han Li had even dismantled a three-story pavilion in the secret realm and rebuilt it in his own cave heaven, near the spiritual field, and named it "Cang Yao Lou".

After placing the field, Han Li immediately left the cave heaven and saw Ti Hu and the other giant ape puppets entering the silver light gate.

"Ti Hu, I've only placed the field there, but it still needs to be embedded in the cave heaven's spiritual veins and irrigated with spiritual liquid to take root," Han Li said as he passed by Ti Hu.

"Don't worry, Master, I'll take care of it!"

Ti Hu took her orders and left, and Han Li closed the silver light gate.

After finishing, he looked towards the deeper part of the secret realm.

The area was still heavily restricted, and it was clear that it would be difficult to pass through.

Han Li looked for a moment, and his brow furrowed slightly. He suppressed his spiritual energy and ran towards the restricted area, quickly disappearing into the hills.

He had only just left when several figures flew towards the area from the high skies, including the Ling Xiao Gate, Lie Guang City, and Qing Su Valley.

The people from the three sects landed and argued among themselves. The burly man from the Ling Xiao Gate, Zhang Kai, opened his arms to stop the crowd and reminded them loudly:

"Everyone, this time the Tian Shui Sect and the Tong Tian Sword Sect have also intervened, we must unite and work together to gain benefits from this secret realm. We can't let our greed get the better of us."

"Zhang Kai, stop your nonsense, what do you propose?" a Lie Guang City elder asked.

"Yang Chang, everyone, let's calm down and discuss this. I suggest we work together to harvest the spiritual herbs in this garden, and if other sects want to intervene, we'll resist together," Zhang Kai said.

"This proposal is not bad, but the secret realm has been sealed for many years, and the harvest from the spiritual herb garden will be plentiful. How will we divide it?" a Qing Su Valley elder asked.

"We'll each choose one of the three layers," Zhang Kai said.

"Alright, let's agree on that," Yang Chang said.

The three sects agreed and entered the spiritual herb garden.

But soon, a series of angry shouts came from the garden.

"What's going on..." Yang Chang shouted.

Immediately after, the Qing Su Valley elder, Fu Gu, roared: "Who was the first to harvest the herbs..."

Before the commotion died down, another voice, full of rage, shouted:
"Who is the scoundrel who even dug up the spirit field?" Yu Kuohai's angry roar echoed through the air, causing the other two sects to pause, then glance at their own spirit fields. Although the older and more valuable spirit medicines had already been harvested, there were still some tens of thousands of years' worth of spirit medicines left. It was unthinkable that the entire spirit field would be dug up.

The air was filled with curses and shouts as the three sects gathered in the spirit medicine garden.

Yu Kuohai's face turned iron-gray as he gazed at the devastated landscape. The deep pit, which seemed to have been excavated recently, still had damp soil.

He leapt into the air, scanning his surroundings from above, trying to find the person responsible for the destruction. However, he found nothing.

After the three sects finished gathering the remaining spirit medicines, they reunited and began cursing the person who had harvested the spirit medicines first.

"Now, continuing to curse that scoundrel is pointless. When we arrived, the people from Huang Feng Men and Mo Xiang Lou had already gone to a nearby building, not far from here. If we hurry, we might still be able to catch up," Yu Kuohai said, suppressing his anger.

"This might lead to conflict with the two sects..." Fu Gu Zhu hesitated.

"What's to fear? They're just Huang Feng Men and Mo Xiang Lou, not the mighty Tian Shui Sect," Yang Changlao sneered.

"If they're willing to give up some of their treasures, we might let them off. But if they refuse, don't blame us for being ruthless," Yu Kuohai said with a cold smile.

The three sects agreed and immediately flew off towards the building.

However, they had only flown halfway when they saw the people from Huang Feng Men and Mo Xiang Lou flying towards them. The group had also been joined by people from Bai Yun Shan Zhuang and Wang You Ge.

The two groups met in mid-air, stopping at a distance of several hundred meters. They stared at each other, their faces unpleasant, and a sense of foreboding settled in.

"Did you... did you also get robbed?" Yu Kuohai asked hesitantly.

"Did you... did you also get robbed?" the gray-haired old woman from Huang Feng Men asked, raising an eyebrow.

"They even dug up a part of our spirit field," Yu Kuohai gritted his teeth.

"We were almost completely cleaned out."

The old woman's words were interrupted by someone behind her, "And our tower was also destroyed!"

The two groups compared notes and simultaneously cursed, "Who is this heaven-sent scoundrel?"

Meanwhile, in a nearby forest, Han Li suddenly sneezed and rubbed his nose, feeling the dry air.

His expression was slightly hesitant, and he seemed unsure of what to do.

Earlier, when the secret realm appeared, there had been a clear disturbance in the outside world, indicating that someone had entered. However, to avoid detection, Han Li had not used his divine sense to investigate, so he did not know how many people had entered or what kind of people they were.

At the moment, he was still some distance from the core of the secret realm. He wanted to break through the restrictions and arrive at the core before the others, but time was not on his side. Moreover, he did not want to conflict with these people, as it would expose his identity and attract the attention of the Xian Gong and the treasure hunters.

However, based on his experiences in the secret realm, he knew that it was not simple, and the treasures hidden within were not ordinary. Most importantly, he had sensed a hint of temporal law energy emanating from the core, which made him extremely eager to obtain it.

After some deliberation, Han Li decided on a compromise. He released a small amount of divine sense energy, scanning the surrounding area.

A moment later, he took out a crimson mask from the Wheel of Rebirth and put it on.

A burst of light enveloped him, and his face changed, becoming that of a middle-aged man with a wide nose and drooping eyelids, looking somewhat dull.

Without using his divine sense, his body suddenly shrunk, becoming shorter and more robust, like a farmer who had spent years working in the fields.

Han Li released a small amount of divine sense energy, controlling it to mimic the aura of a Golden Immortal at the early stage.

He created a water mirror in his palm and examined his reflection, nodding in satisfaction.

After putting away the mirror, Han Li disappeared into the forest, his figure flashing out of sight.
