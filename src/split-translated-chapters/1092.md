Han Li stood in the air above the sea, his eyes scanning the surroundings.

Above him, a thick layer of dark clouds had gathered, almost pressing down on him, and the sound of howling winds filled the air. Huge storms from all directions were rushing towards him, creating massive whirlpools that rose up to tens of thousands of feet high, colliding and merging with each other, and squeezing towards the center of the storm where Han Li was standing.

Although Han Li knew that this was just an illusion, the suffocating pressure and the cold, icy feeling of the waves crashing against him were too real, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of fear.

"Rumble, rumble"

As the deafening roar of the storm grew louder, the seven or eight whirlpools finally collided, merging into a single massive whirlpool that swallowed Han Li whole.

His body was tossed about by the turbulent water, battered by the intense pressure, and his entire body felt like it was in agony. His mind was even starting to feel a bit disoriented.

Han Li's thoughts stirred, and suddenly a loud thunderclap boomed, and a brilliant golden light burst forth, shining like the sun and expanding in all directions. The golden light filled the air, and the massive whirlpool was torn apart in an instant.

His body plummeted downwards, falling directly into the sea.

Han Li's mind suddenly stirred, and he realized that something was off.

The water around him seemed to have no buoyancy at all, and no matter how hard he tried to resist with his spiritual energy, he was still sinking downwards.

And this deep sea seemed to have no bottom, with no floating fish or other living creatures, only Han Li's solitary figure, sinking deeper and deeper into the darkness.

As Han Li was trapped in the illusion, the others were experiencing similar situations, although the scenery of their illusions was different.

For example, Jiao San was trapped in a blood-red river, with a thick, eerie atmosphere that made her heart tremble. The river was devoid of any living creatures, only a group of ghostly figures floating about, like water plants swaying in the current.

As Jiao San's body was swept away by the river, the ghostly figures attached themselves to her, wrapping around her body like a shroud, and her body began to feel heavier and heavier, sinking deeper into the riverbed.

Lei Yu and the others were also standing still, as if they had been petrified, their faces twisted in a mixture of fear and confusion. They were all trapped in their own illusions, unable to break free.

At this moment, Lan Yuanzi and Lan Yan, who had been standing still, suddenly had a waterÂç∞ pattern appear on their arms, and a blue light burst forth, entering their heads and merging together.

The two lights merged, and a brilliant blue light burst forth, filling the air with a powerful water attribute energy. The light coalesced into a blue water screen, enveloping the two siblings.

As soon as the screen closed, Lan Yuanzi and Lan Yan opened their eyes, their faces pale.

"This is an incredibly powerful water elemental illusion array..." Lan Yan said, clutching her chest, gasping for breath.

"I didn't expect that the water spirit symbol our master planted in us would come into effect here, and that we would receive our master's blessing..." Lan Yuanzi said, taking a deep breath.

"It's also thanks to the fact that we're both here, and that the symbol was activated, that we were able to break free from the illusion. Otherwise, even with the power of the symbol, it's unlikely that either of us would have been able to escape." Lan Yan said, her eyes filled with a hint of fear.

"Enough, we can't waste any more time. Let's go check out the main hall." Lan Yuanzi said, his eyes gleaming with determination.

"But what about them?" Lan Yan asked, looking at the others who were still trapped in their illusions.

"Whether or not they can break free, it's up to their own abilities." Lan Yuanzi said, shaking his head.

The two siblings, protected by the blue water screen, quickly made their way through the misty square, arriving at the entrance to the grand hall.

Lan Yuanzi approached the entrance, and after a quick check, found that the door was no longer sealed. He pushed the door open, and a powerful water attribute energy burst forth, enveloping the two siblings.

The two of them stepped into the hall, and saw a blue-colored altar standing before them, identical in size and shape to the golden altar they had seen before.

On the altar, there were two damaged areas, each with a small blue pouch floating above them. The pouches were made of silk, with a water wave pattern embroidered on them, and they radiated a powerful water attribute energy.

Next to the blue pouches, a golden flame was burning, just like the one they had seen on the golden altar.

The two siblings looked at each other, and then approached the altar, their ears ringing with the sound of "Rumble, rumble".

Lan Yuanzi immediately grabbed Lan Yan's arm, stopping her from moving forward, and listened carefully to the sound.

The sound was coming from the blue pouch, and it was like the sound of a river bursting its banks, making their hearts tremble with fear.

Lan Yuanzi's eyes lit up, and he exchanged a look with Lan Yan. Both of their faces were filled with a mixture of excitement and joy.

"Little sister, wait here, I'll go get that treasure." Lan Yuanzi said, his eyes gleaming with an unusual light, as he released Lan Yan's arm and smiled.
"Brother, don't be in a hurry, what if you take this treasure and it's like what Lei Yu Ce said before, and it releases that unparalleled demonic head? What then?" Lan Yan's eyes flashed with a hint of hesitation as she spoke.

"Don't worry, even if Lei Yu Ce's words are true, even if the demonic head is released, there are others who will deal with it. At worst, we can just leave this place and return to the Jiuyuan Temple, and everything will be none of our concern," Lan Yuanzi patted her hand and said softly.

"But..." Lan Yan's voice trailed off, still seemingly worried.

Just as she was about to continue, Lan Yuanzi interrupted her: "Think about it, we first failed to capture Han Li, and then we offended She Yan. If we don't achieve anything this time, what will happen when we return to the sect?"

Lan Yan's expression changed slightly as she heard this, and she fell silent.

"We'll be punished, and who knows, maybe even our master will be implicated... But if we can bring this treasure back to the sect, perhaps we can avoid some of the blame, at least we won't implicate our master," Lan Yuanzi added.

"Alright, let's do it," Lan Yan's expression finally relaxed as she said.

Lan Yuanzi smiled and nodded, turning to walk towards the altar.

After taking two steps, he stopped and turned back to Lan Yan: "The previous altar's restriction was too strong, the power of the law array within this blue cloth bag is no weaker. The disturbance will be great, you and I should keep our distance, be careful."

"Brother, if that's the case, don't try to do it alone, let's use the fusion technique instead. If something goes wrong, even if we can't get the treasure, at least we can protect ourselves," Lan Yan said, seemingly having thought of something.

Lan Yuanzi's brow furrowed slightly as he listened, appearing hesitant.

Lan Yan didn't press the issue, instead scanning the surroundings with her eyes.

"Alright, that's a good idea, otherwise, I wouldn't have much confidence in my own abilities," Lan Yuanzi said after a moment's thought.

Lan Yan smiled and walked with Lan Yuanzi to the altar.

Lan Yuanzi examined the altar for a moment before raising his hand, and a multitude of array flags and array disks appeared, floating in front of him as he began to set up the array.

...

Within the illusion array, Han Li and the others' faces were contorted in pain, unable to break free.

Han Li was still trapped in the depths of the sea, unable to wake up no matter how hard he tried to use his cultivation technique.

"Could it be that this illusion array isn't based on spiritual anomalies, but rather constructed using water attribute law?" he thought to himself, still unsure of how to break free.

The sea around him seemed endless, and no matter how deep he sank, he couldn't reach the bottom.

Han Li even felt a sense of disorientation, as if he had entered a realm where time and space didn't exist, and he would continue to sink forever if he couldn't break free.

...

About an hour later, a circular array had formed around the altar in the main hall.

Lan Yuanzi checked the array, then nodded to Lan Yan.

She raised her hand, and a sky-blue oil-paper umbrella appeared, opening up with a soft whoosh.

On the umbrella's surface, a vivid painting of a pond with red fish and green water seemed to come to life, with ripples on the surface.

Lan Yan twirled the umbrella handle, and the umbrella spun around, its surface rippling as if the water was being stirred.

She raised her hand, and the umbrella flew up, covering the altar like a canopy.

"Begin," Lan Yuanzi said softly.

The two of them simultaneously activated their techniques, and a layer of water-blue light enveloped them, forming a large and small spiritual domain that surrounded the altar.

As they began to chant, the array flags began to unfurl, releasing a powerful water attribute energy.

The array disks on the ground lit up, and water-blue pillars of light rose up, surrounding the altar.
