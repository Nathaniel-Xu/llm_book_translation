Yu Menghan heard the words and her expression changed, surprised and asked, "Disciple... just now, you used the Thunder Technique in your dream again?"

The old woman sighed and said, "Ai, you're really making things difficult for me...". The old woman had a fond expression in her eyes.

Although the old woman had founded the Meng Tan Sect over a million years ago, she had never been able to find a disciple who could truly inherit her teachings. She had discovered Yu Menghan by chance, guided by a dream, and had taken her in as her disciple.

The old woman had spent her long life cultivating to the peak of the Great Luo Realm, and had always hoped to break through the final barrier and become the Ancestor of the Dream Path. However, she had never been able to achieve this, and now felt that her hopes were slim.

But Yu Menghan's appearance had given the old woman another option, and she had placed all her hopes on her.

Yu Menghan indeed had a great aptitude for cultivating this path, and as long as she was willing to work hard and cultivate, with the old woman's guidance, she would have a great future ahead of her.

However, the old woman was somewhat annoyed that Yu Menghan seemed to be deeply entangled with the past, and the "Five Thunder True Classics" had been put aside, and she was secretly cultivating this technique while cultivating the supreme path that the old woman had passed down to her.

"Alright, the Bodhi Banquet is about to begin, don't sleep anymore, and later when you receive the Bodhi Fruit, you must treasure it, it's a great opportunity for the Great Dao." The old woman couldn't scold Yu Menghan, so she said.

"Master, do I have a share of the fruit?" Yu Menghan asked excitedly.

"You don't, none of the attendants have a share, only those who have been formally invited by the Heavenly Court and those who hold the Bodhi Command have this great opportunity. But since I'm the one eating the fruit, I'll give you a taste." The old woman smiled.

"No, no, if it's Master's fruit, I won't eat it." Yu Menghan shook her head repeatedly.

"Stupid girl, you don't know how precious the Bodhi Fruit is, even those Taiyi Great Luo cultivators, and those Dao Ancestors, all cherish it. Of course, the fruit has different levels, and the Heavenly Court will distinguish them based on cultivation level and relationship with the Heavenly Court." The old woman pointed to Yu Menghan's brow and smiled.

"Master's fruit..." Yu Menghan asked half a sentence, then felt it wasn't suitable and stopped.

"Mine is naturally the highest level of fruit, so when I receive it, you mustn't rush to eat it. I'll seal it with a technique, and when we return to the Meng Tan Sect, I'll gradually divide it and give it to you to eat, so you can absorb the fruit's medicinal properties without harming your body." The old woman smiled contentedly.

"Meng Po, you're really generous, the Bodhi Fruit was condensed by the Heavenly Court's secret technique, and it took a long time to refine it, you're just giving it to your disciple like that?" A deep voice spoke up from the side.

The old woman didn't even need to turn her head to scold, "Mind your own business, old thing, it's my fruit, I can give it to whoever I want!"

Yu Menghan couldn't help but turn her head to look, and saw a tall, gray-robed old man, with a face that wasn't particularly remarkable, but his aura was impressive.

However, his worn-out gray robes stood out in contrast to the others' luxurious clothing.

"Ha ha, the Bodhi Fruit can help those who haven't achieved the Dao to gain insight, and for those who have achieved the Dao, it can slow down the erosion of the Heavenly Dao..." The old man said with a smile.

"Meng Po, shut up, you old dog, don't meddle in other people's business." The old woman turned her head and scolded.

The gray-robed old man, whose Dao name was Cangwu, immediately shrank his neck and stopped speaking.

"Master, is what he said true?" Yu Menghan asked, her heart shaken.

Since following Meng Po, Yu Menghan's horizons had expanded, and she had learned about many secrets of the True Immortal Realm. When she heard Cangwu's words, she realized that the Bodhi Fruit was even more precious than she had imagined.

"Of course, it's true, otherwise, a Dao Ancestor like Cangwu wouldn't be so submissive to the Heavenly Court, it's not just because of the pressure, but also because of the benefits." The old woman transmitted her voice to Yu Menghan.

Yu Menghan heard the voice in her heart and made up her mind, no matter what, she wouldn't eat the Bodhi Fruit.

"Thank you, senior, for pointing this out." Yu Menghan transmitted her voice, knowing that Cangwu had intentionally revealed this, probably hoping that the old woman would eat the fruit herself.

Cangwu heard this and smiled, "Meng Po, you have good fortune, you've really taken in a good disciple..."

He said, and then his eyes flashed with a hint of sadness, and he walked to a nearby table, sat down, and closed his eyes, with a calm and serene expression.

Yu Menghan looked at the lively scene around her, and her heart felt a pang of sadness, and suddenly, Han Li's image appeared in her mind.

She didn't know where he was now...

...

In the unknown realm, the Ten Directions Great Array.

Han Li stood suspended in the dark void, and in front of him, 72 sword spirits were flying around, forming a powerful sword array.

As the golden light flashed, the 72 spirits appeared, each transforming into a golden flying sword, with their sword auras intersecting and condensing into a golden heavenly gate.
The Heaven's Gate that appeared before them was vastly different from the one that Han Li's Heaven's Gate Sword Array had transformed into. The current Heaven's Gate seemed weak and illusory, as if it were a mere shadow. However, the power of the lightning laws it contained was real and potent.

Even from outside the array's boundaries, the group couldn't help but gasp in amazement.

"How can this be? He's clearly cultivating the power of time laws, yet his Heaven's Gate contains such pure and domineering lightning laws?" The ugly old woman, Zhu Yan, asked in a strange tone.

The others exchanged glances, equally perplexed, but no one could provide an answer.

"His Heaven's Gate is truly extraordinary, perhaps it's a primordial divine artifact that has seized the heavens' creation?" Dong Li Hu speculated.

As they spoke, the illusory Heaven's Gate within the Ten Directions Array suddenly opened, revealing a sea of golden light that churned and foamed. Thousands of golden dragons emerged, swimming towards the edge of the boundary.

A deafening roar shook the heavens as the golden dragons, infused with the power of lightning laws, collided with the boundary. The impact was like a series of explosions, sending shockwaves through the air.

The boundary's internal energy fluctuated wildly, as a violent force, accompanied by golden lightning, ricocheted back and forth, causing the air to vibrate.

Han Li dodged the shockwaves, his brow furrowed in surprise.

What kind of array could seal off an entire space, preventing even the transmission of shockwaves? He wondered.

Meanwhile, in another part of the array, Jin Tong was punching the boundary with his golden fist, creating a series of explosions that echoed through the void.

The other ten domains connected to the Ten Directions Array were also affected, with mountains shaking, volcanoes erupting, and oceans churning with unprecedented ferocity. The domains were exerting their collective power to suppress Han Li and Jin Tong.

The cultivators stationed at the array's nodes were also affected, with some struggling to maintain their footing. The Taiyi Jade Immortals were particularly strained, their auras turbulent and unstable.

As for the Golden Immortals, many were unable to withstand the pressure, and some even collapsed, bleeding from their seven orifices.

However, the array remained stable, with new cultivators replacing those who faltered.

The four observers outside the array checked on the cultivators' condition and breathed a sigh of relief.

"If it's just this level of power, we can control it. Give them ten days or half a month, and they won't be able to do anything," Meng Yuan said, a hint of a smile on his face.

"We can't be complacent, we need to carefully monitor the situation and fill any gaps immediately," Zi Shu cautioned.

"Understood," Dong Li Hu replied, followed by the others.

 Inside the array, Han Li had withdrawn his sword spirit, Tongzi, and stood in mid-air, his brow furrowed in thought.

Just then, a golden light flew towards him, and Jin Tong's figure emerged from it.

"This array is too strange, I couldn't break through it with my power," Jin Tong said, arms crossed, looking somewhat frustrated.

"The heavens and earth are completely sealed off here, my Heaven's Gate Sword Array can't communicate with the heavens, and I can only use a portion of its power. I also can't break through this boundary," Han Li explained.

"Why don't we stop attacking the boundary and try something else? You and I can exchange a blow, and see if the resulting power can tear open the void. If it can, we can use the opening to escape into the outside space," Jin Tong suggested, a spark of inspiration in her eyes.

Han Li considered her proposal and thought it was worth a try.

The two of them quickly took up positions, creating a distance of tens of thousands of miles between them. One of them punched, and the other swung their sword, colliding in a flash of lightning.

The resulting shockwave was even more powerful than before, causing the space to shudder and the void to erupt with explosions. The impact reverberated throughout the array, taking a long time to dissipate.

Jin Tong dodged the residual energy and approached Han Li.

The two of them exchanged a glance, both disappointed. Their previous attack, although powerful, had not achieved its intended goal of tearing open the void.
