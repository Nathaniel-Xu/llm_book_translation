Regarding the Cycle of Rebirth, since it can be mentioned alongside Time and Space as the three supreme laws, it is the most fundamental and mysterious rule of this realm.

It can be said that the three thousand great paths and the myriad things in the world are all interdependent with these three supreme laws, having a complex relationship.

Rebirth has always been a mysterious and obscure matter, involving the concept of reincarnation and the transmigration of souls.

However, cultivators who pursue the Great Path of Longevity naturally hope to escape the cycle of rebirth, while ordinary people who have not achieved true immortality will inevitably fall into the cycle of rebirth after death.

As for what happens after entering the cycle of rebirth, it seems that no one can truly explain it.

Han Li speculated that perhaps it was because he had left behind his divine soul energy or something else when he planted the two techniques in Li Yuanji's Sea of Knowledge, and now Li Yuanji had discovered it and mistakenly believed that he was the reincarnation of Lingyunzi.

Li Yuanji, who was now a respected Dao Ancestor, was revered by even the Heavenly Court, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia for his former mentor, which was why he had brought up this matter.

Han Li's narrow escape from death today could be said to be a result of fate.

"Hey, uncle, what's wrong with you? Where are we going next?" Jin Tong tugged on Han Li's arm, shaking him out of his reverie.

Han Li came back to his senses, looked around, and saw only the endless ocean.

He then took out the jade slip that Lan Yuan had given him, which recorded the map of the Jiuyuan Temple, and examined it carefully.

"It seems that we are no longer in the territory of the Jiuyuan Temple. To be safe, let's leave the Dajin Yuan Xian Domain as soon as possible." Han Li said after a moment.

He then chose a direction and led Jin Tong away at a rapid pace.

...

Time passed, and several months had gone by.

In a strange, grayish space, a beautiful woman in a blue long dress was floating in mid-air, following a dark red river that flowed upwards towards its source.

This woman was none other than Jiaosan, who had escaped from the chaos at the Jiuyuan Temple.

This was her first time entering this strange space with her physical body, and she was constantly being suppressed by the strange heavenly laws, only daring to use her full strength to operate the Cycle of Rebirth.

As she flew over the dark red river, she saw five other rivers flowing alongside it, each with its own unique color and scenery, and she didn't dare to look at them too closely.

After flying for hundreds of miles, Jiaosan finally saw the crystal stone arch bridge that stood at the source of the six rivers.

Unlike the last time she had transmitted her divine soul into this place, the black-clad woman was no longer on the riverbank below the bridge, only the Wheel of Rebirth's master, who was sitting on the bridge, still wearing his large hat and thick cloak.

Today, he was still in the same posture as before, hunched over, holding the bamboo fishing rod with white speckles, and a dark red crystal thread hanging from the rod, swaying gently in the water.

"Greetings, master."

Jiaosan landed on the bridge, bowed, and greeted the master.

"You've made it here with your physical body, and you're still calm and composed. Your cultivation and state of mind must have improved again. However, there's a faint dark mark between your eyebrows, indicating that you've been injured. Why didn't you wait until your injuries healed before coming?" The master asked without turning around.

"I've only suffered a minor injury, and it's already healed," Jiaosan replied.

"A small leak can sink a great ship. Don't underestimate the Jiuyuan Temple's methods. That faint injury is not as simple as it seems," the master said, still not turning around.

As soon as he finished speaking, he lifted his fishing rod, and the dark red crystal thread shot out, making a soft "popping" sound.

On the end of the thread was a dark red crystal fish, which shot out of the water and flew towards Jiaosan's forehead.

Jiaosan's body swayed slightly, as if she was about to dodge, but she quickly regained her balance and allowed the crystal fish to fly into her forehead, disappearing into her skin.

A red glow erupted from her forehead, and a layer of red light spread out, illuminating her face.

Jiaosan's face turned bright red, and the red crystal thread could be seen moving under her skin, glowing with a soft light.
After a dozen breaths, the red glow gradually dissipated, and the strange aura on her face finally disappeared.

"Thank you, Lord," Jiao San immediately bowed down, her face filled with joy.

At the same time, the dark, dull mark between her eyebrows had completely disappeared, and all the injuries on her body had been wiped clean. Moreover, the ten or so spiritual apertures on her body had all been fully connected in just a short dozen breaths.

"How did it go?" The Lord of the Reincarnation Hall finally asked.

"We got it," Jiao San replied concisely.

She knew that the Lord only cared about this one thing, and wouldn't bother with the details of their losses.

As soon as she finished speaking, Jiao San's wrist turned, and a colorful light burst forth from her palm. The small, five-colored bottle appeared, emitting a strong spiritual energy wave.

The Lord of the Reincarnation Hall sensed the energy wave coming from behind him, and turned his wrist to put away his fishing rod. He stood up, and to Jiao San's surprise, he appeared to be quite tall and majestic, despite his previously hunched posture. However, when he turned around, his wide, conical hat still covered his face, making it impossible to see his features.

With a casual wave of his hand, the five-colored bottle flew out of Jiao San's hand and into his.

Jiao San stood solemnly to the side, waiting for the Lord's instructions.

"Ha ha..." The Lord examined the bottle for a moment before bursting into laughter.

"Lord, why are you laughing?" Jiao San asked, puzzled.

"You were tricked by Li Yuanji," the Lord said, chuckling. "The thing you brought back is just a fake."

Jiao San's expression turned ugly as she took the bottle back. "Lord, I...I apologize..."

The Lord waved his hand, and Jiao San fell to her knees. "This isn't your fault. I didn't tell you what you were looking for beforehand. This five-colored bottle is a high-quality imitation of the Heavenly Vessel Bottle, made with the finest materials and craftsmanship. It's comparable to a second-grade immortal artifact. You were deceived, and it's understandable."

Jiao San didn't get up, still bowing. "Please give us another chance, Lord. I'll bring back the real thing this time."

The Lord shook his head. "The commotion you caused this time is too great. Not only will the Jiu Yuan Palace be thoroughly investigated, but the entire Jin Yuan Immortal Domain will be cleared out. Moreover, Li Yuanji personally appeared, and you managed to return almost unscathed. This represents his attitude towards us, and we can't ignore it."

Jiao San's eyes widened in surprise. "Lord, you're saying that we were able to escape because Li Yuanji intentionally let us go? Why would he do that, given the relationship between the Jiu Yuan Palace and the Heavenly Court?"

The Lord thought for a moment before responding. "I can think of two reasons. One is that he wants us to know that the Jiu Yuan Palace doesn't want to clash with us. The other is that he wants to prove his innocence through this opportunity."

Jiao San's eyes lit up with understanding. "The Heavenly Court sent the Feng Tian Immortal Envoy to investigate the Jiu Yuan Palace, and we killed him. The thing they created was stolen from us, and now the Heavenly Court won't suspect them."

The Lord smiled. "Li Yuanji is very good at hiding his tracks. The Heavenly Vessel Bottle was a treasured artifact that many top powers coveted, but it was lost and never found. Now, they've created a fake five-colored bottle, and it seems reasonable. However, the Heavenly Court won't be easily fooled."

Jiao San hesitated before asking, "Lord, what did the Jiu Yuan Palace create that made the Heavenly Court so cautious?"

The Lord just smiled and shook his head, saying nothing.

Jiao San didn't press the issue, remaining silent.

After a while, the Lord spoke up. "From now on, don't reveal any information about what we obtained. Stop all activities in the Jin Yuan Immortal Domain, and create a bigger commotion in the neighboring domains."

Jiao San's eyes flashed with a hint of confusion.

The Lord continued, "As long as we don't spread any news about what we obtained, the Heavenly Court can only make wild guesses. The more they suspect, the greater the rift between them and the Jiu Yuan Palace will grow."

Jiao San's expression changed, and she responded, "I understand, Lord."

The Lord nodded. "Remember, a seed of suspicion will take root and grow, becoming a good thing for us. We don't have much time left, and there are other things we need to do."

The Lord gazed out at the distant river, his eyes lost in thought.
