Han Li and the others disappeared into the distance, and two figures suddenly appeared on a nearby mountain wall, surrounded by a white glow. They were the Copper Lion Demon and the White Bone Demon.

The other demons were nowhere to be seen, and it was unclear where they had gone.

The two demons stood side by side, seemingly familiar with each other.

"Unexpectedly, that human cultivator's divine sense is so strong, and the Heaven Bone Ring almost couldn't be concealed." The White Bone Demon let out a sigh and spat out a white ring.

The white ring seemed to be made from some kind of white bone and was suspended in the air, surrounded by a white mist. Its surface glowed with a soft white light, but it didn't emit any aura.

Not only that, but the Copper Lion Demon and the White Bone Demon's auras were also suppressed, and they didn't emit any aura.

"You've been sealed for so many years, but you haven't been idle. The Heaven Bone Ring has been refined to be even more exquisite, and it's almost reached the fifth grade, right?" The Copper Lion Demon looked at the white ring and said.

"Over the years, I've been sealed in that dark place without any demonic energy to cultivate, so I could only focus on refining my demonic treasure. Speaking of which, your Thundercutter Knife is probably similar." The White Bone Demon sighed and said.

The Copper Lion Demon's face lit up with a hint of joy when he heard this, but then his expression darkened as he remembered the destruction of his Xuanming Divine Hammer.

"Unexpectedly, that Han thief not only has powerful divine abilities but also a strong divine sense. I thought that with your Heaven Bone Ring, we could sneak up on those people undetected and ambush Han and the others, but now it seems that's impossible." The Copper Lion Demon's eyes flashed with hatred and said.

"After all these years, your temper hasn't changed at all. You still can't stand losing and want to take revenge immediately." The White Bone Demon shook his head and said.

"Living in the world, if you can't avenge your grievances, what's the point of living?" The Copper Lion Demon snorted.

The White Bone Demon glanced at him and sighed.

"By the way, were your Law Threads really refined by that person? You've already condensed a Law Ring, so how could they be refined in such a short time?" The White Bone Demon asked.

"That Han thief has a gourd in his hand, which is probably a Heaven and Earth treasure with extremely powerful refining effects. My Law Threads were absorbed and refined by that Heaven and Earth gourd." The Copper Lion Demon said with hatred.

"Heaven and Earth treasure! No wonder, Heaven and Earth treasures are born from the heavens and earth, and they often contain extremely powerful laws." The White Bone Demon said with realization.

"That Han thief absorbed half of my Law Threads, and I must take them back. Even if he has a Heaven and Earth treasure, he can't refine the Law Threads' original aura in such a short time. As long as I can take them back, I can re-refine them and restore them to their original state." The Copper Lion Demon said.

"Old Three, the enemy is numerous and powerful, and we can't take them on alone. I've just escaped from my seal, and I won't follow you to seek death. Don't blame me for not being loyal to our brotherhood!" The White Bone Demon's expression changed, and he said.

"Second Brother, don't worry, I'm not stupid. I won't do anything rash. I heard those people talking, and they're going to continue searching for other array eyes. Those greedy people will definitely be tempted by the treasures on the array eyes and will take action to steal them. We'll follow them and help them if necessary, and we'll rescue Big Brother and the others. When we five brothers are reunited, we'll deal with those people easily." The Copper Lion Demon chuckled and said.

The White Bone Demon listened to this and narrowed his eyes, not speaking for a moment.

"What's wrong, Second Brother? Did I say something wrong?" The Copper Lion Demon asked.

"You're not wrong, but rescuing Big Brother and the others will also mean breaking the last three array eyes. If all five array eyes are broken, the power of the seal will be weakened to the extreme, and Black Heaven Demon Ancestor might escape. We can't forget that we were involved in his sealing back then." The White Bone Demon said with concern.

"What should we do? Can't we rescue Big Brother and the others?" The Copper Lion Demon's expression changed, and he asked.

Just then, the White Bone Demon suddenly turned around and shouted, "What person is hiding there? Come out!"

He stretched out his hand, and five white lights shot out from his fingertips, grasping at the nearby void.

The five lights were white and bright, like the glow of white bones, and they emitted a crackling sound as they moved.

The five lights exploded, and the void nearby fluctuated violently. A figure wrapped in golden light suddenly appeared.

The five lights hadn't dissipated yet, and they transformed into a white bone hand, surrounded by bright white flames that didn't emit any heat. The hand grasped at the figure.

The five fingers left five black marks on the void.

The figure wasn't flustered, and the golden light on its body intensified before expanding outward.

The golden light enveloped the white bone hand, which immediately stopped moving before shattering into pieces and dispersing.

...

At this moment, Han Li, who was flying towards the mountain peak, felt a slight fluctuation in the golden light on his body. He looked down and saw the White Bone Demon's actions, and his eyes flashed with a fierce light.
Han Li, what's wrong? Jiao San asked, noticing Han Li's actions.

Nothing. Han Li's face didn't reveal any emotions, and he quickly flew forward.

Jiao San looked at Han Li's back, furrowed his brow, and glanced downward, but quickly shook his head and followed.

...

This is... The white bone demon's face changed as he saw the scene.

The bronze lion demon roared and raised his black lightning knife, ready to strike, but was stopped by the white bone demon.

Haha, it's been years since we last met, and White Bone's Bone Law has become even more cunning and ruthless! A red figure emerged, revealing his body, and it was Qi Mozi.

His aura was like a deep pool, and his cultivation seemed to have fully recovered.

You! The white bone demon's eyes flashed with cold light as he saw Qi Mozi, as if he recognized him.

Second brother, do you know this person? Who is he? The bronze lion demon asked, his eyes wide with surprise.

He's Qi Mozi, a fellow cultivator who was once the second disciple of the True Words Sect's Mi Luo Old Ancestor, but later betrayed his master and joined the Heavenly Court. The white bone demon's eyes flashed with mockery.

Ah, so you're the traitor from the True Words Sect. I've heard a lot about you, but it's not the same as seeing you in person. The bronze lion demon looked Qi Mozi up and down, his face full of disdain.

Qi Mozi, I've heard that you made great contributions in the suppression of the True Words Sect. You must be in a high position in the Heavenly Court now. The white bone demon sneered.

Back then, my master went against the heavens, and I advised him to stop, but he wouldn't listen. I had no choice but to abandon the darkness and join the Heavenly Court. As for my current position, I'm grateful to the Dao Ancestor for his trust, and I'm now the warden of the Heavenly Prison. Qi Mozi smiled, his face not showing any shame or awkwardness.

At the same time, he took out a golden token in the shape of a tiger's head and played with it in his hand.

The token looked ordinary, but there was a strange aura emanating from the two ancient characters on it: Prison Warden.

The air around them trembled as the aura was released.

The white bone demon saw Qi Mozi's expression and his mocking smile slowly faded, replaced by a hint of seriousness.

Pfft! Traitors like you are a dime a dozen, but I've never seen anyone as shameless as you, who betrayed their master and joined the enemy without any remorse. The bronze lion demon spat and scolded.

You're the famous Copper Lion King of the Five Kings of the Demonic Realm, and I've heard that you're as fierce as a wildfire. Today, I see that it's true, and I admire your spirit. Qi Mozi looked at the bronze lion demon and smiled calmly, his expression still not showing any anger.

The bronze lion demon was praised by Qi Mozi, and he seemed to swallow a fly, spitting again and wanting to say something.

Third brother. The white bone demon stopped him with a cold gaze.

The bronze lion demon saw the white bone demon's expression and stopped talking.

So, you're already the warden of the Heavenly Prison. Congratulations. What brings you here? The white bone demon glanced at the golden token and asked, his eyes narrowing.

Don't worry, I'm not here on behalf of the Heavenly Court. The current Heavenly Prison is under my control, and it's not the same as it was in the past. I won't attack you, and instead, we can cooperate. Qi Mozi put away the token and smiled.

What do you mean? The white bone demon's expression changed slightly, but his wariness increased, and he asked.

I overheard your conversation with those people, and it seems you have some grudges with them. I also have some unfinished business with them. White Bone, we're old acquaintances, why don't we work together? Qi Mozi looked in the direction Han Li and the others had left and said.

Working together? Qi Mozi, you're already in the Great Luo Realm, and you cultivate the Time Law. What can't you do? Do you need our help? The white bone demon's eyes flashed with surprise.

It's not that simple. My power is strong, but those people are numerous and powerful. Especially one of them is extremely powerful, and I'm not sure I can handle him. Qi Mozi smiled.

Hmph!

The bronze lion demon heard this and thought of Han Li's image, his eyes flashing with anger, and he coldly snorted.
