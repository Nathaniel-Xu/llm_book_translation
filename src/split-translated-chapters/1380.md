The current Demon Lord's clothes were torn and tattered, looking rather disheveled, and his face was filled with incredulity when he saw Han Li.

After rescuing the Demon Lord, Han Li's eyes flashed with black light as he activated the Nine Yin Demon Eyes, continuing to scan the surroundings in search of Guo or Jin's trail.

However, after Guo or Jin entered the spiritual realm, he seemed to have vanished into thin air, leaving behind no trace of his presence.

"Guo or Jin is trying to delay us, time is running out," the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth said, looking at the constantly growing chaos vortex with a furrowed brow.

Han Li's heart stirred, and he felt a stronger sense of mental connection with the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth, as if he could see through the other's thoughts and intentions.

The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth's words were not spoken aloud, but Han Li had already sensed them in his mind.

But he wondered if the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth could also sense his own thoughts.

"If he continues to hide in the spiritual realm, how can we force him out?" the Demon Lord asked.

"Brother Han cultivates the Five Elements Fantasy Decision of the ancient Miro, and now the three of us have gathered the three great supreme laws, we might be able to break through Guo or Jin's spiritual realm," the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth said.

"You're not in a good situation, if you continue to use the Wheel of Rebirth, even if you defeat Guo or Jin, you might be merged with the Heavenly Way," the Demon Lord said.

"Even if I'm merged with the Heavenly Way, it's better than being destroyed along with the world, at this point, let's take a risk!" the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth said.

As he spoke, the dark red glow around him flashed, and the dark red spiritual realm reappeared, making contact with Han Li's time spiritual realm.

The two spiritual realms simultaneously shook and emitted intense light.

Han Li saw this and his pupils slightly contracted.

He was not unfamiliar with this scene, as he had experienced a similar spiritual realm resonance with Gan Jiuren before.

And the resonance between the two spiritual realms was far stronger than before.

As he thought, the two spiritual realms each emitted a powerful attractive force, rapidly approaching each other, and finally merged into one.

Han Li's golden spiritual realm's mountain peaks suddenly expanded, and the originally thousand-meter-high peaks instantly became ten thousand meters high, and the hundred-mile-long rivers became thousand-mile-long rivers, and the time law fluctuations emitted also increased tenfold.

The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth's spiritual realm was the same, but his face did not show any surprise.

"What's going on?" Han Li did not speak, but instead tried to communicate with the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth through his mind.

"You and I are, in a sense, the same person, and the laws naturally resonate easily, and your Refining the Spirit Technique has reached the state of perfection, the seventh layer of the Refining the Spirit Technique allows for mental communication, making it easier to merge laws, and our spiritual realms merging is not surprising," the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth replied through mental communication.

Han Li heard this and felt a sense of sudden understanding.

The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth's previous transmission of the Refining the Spirit Technique to him had actually hidden a deeper meaning.

"Brother Han, I have no ill intentions towards you, everything is to counter Guo or Jin, as long as you help me defeat Guo or Jin and avenge my great enmity, the Wheel of Rebirth will be at your disposal," the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth said, sensing Han Li's wariness.

"Whether we can survive today is still uncertain, let's talk about the future later," Han Li shook his head.

The two were currently mentally connected, and he could feel the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth's sincerity.

But he was not interested in power, and besides, he had to defeat Guo or Jin today, as there was a great dao dispute between them.

In the world, there could only be one Time Dao Ancestor!

This was also related to the entrustment of the ancient Miro.

Han Li snapped his fingers, and the time spiritual realm immediately expanded again, and a series of sword-shaped golden lights shot out from the spiritual realm, sweeping towards Guo or Jin's spiritual realm.

These golden lights contained the virtual shadows of the five elements: fire, water, metal, wood, and earth, each emitting extremely powerful fluctuations.

The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth sensed Han Li's thoughts and felt a sense of relief, and immediately activated the Wheel of Rebirth spiritual realm.

A series of thick, dark red lights shot out from his spiritual realm, entwining with the sword-shaped golden lights from Han Li's spiritual realm.

Han Li and the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth's eyes simultaneously locked, and they both activated their laws, merging the two forces through mental communication.

The golden and dark red lights contained the law forces, which were still somewhat conflicting, but began to truly merge.

The sword-shaped golden lights suddenly expanded, increasing in size by tens of times, and the originally blurry sword bodies became extremely clear, with the sword edge, sword hilt, and sword handle all vividly visible.

Each golden light had transformed into a giant golden sword, with a series of circular, dark red spiritual patterns on the sword body, which was the Wheel of Rebirth law.

A sharp, fierce sword energy erupted from the golden giant sword, cutting towards Guo or Jin's spiritual realm.

With a "sizzling" sound, the golden spiritual realm was easily cut open, revealing a massive rift, and the originally majestic spiritual realm instantly became a tattered and broken piece of cloth.

The Demon Lord's face showed surprise, but he immediately activated the spatial spiritual realm, and a series of silver giant men shot out from the spiritual realm, exploding and destroying the surrounding golden spiritual realm, releasing a powerful spatial destruction force.

His method was originally extremely powerful, and although it was weaker compared to Han Li and the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth's law fusion, it still produced a certain resonance as one of the three great supreme laws.
The ancient or modern golden spiritual realm was violently shaken, on the verge of collapse.

The golden light inside was rolling, trying to repair the cracks, but to no avail.

Han Li and the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth let out a low shout, once again simultaneously urging the spiritual realm.

A myriad of golden sword lights burst forth, slashing at the golden spiritual realm.

The golden spiritual realm finally could not withstand it, emitting a series of muffled sounds, completely shattering and collapsing, turning into countless golden lights that scattered.

The figure of Guo or Jin emerged, but it shocked Han Li and the others.

It was seen that Guo or Jin's body from the waist down had already merged with the chaos vortex, leaving only his upper body.

Moreover, his skin had a multitude of chaos-colored stripes, and his face was the same, looking extremely terrifying.

The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth and the Demon Lord saw Guo or Jin's appearance and were shocked.

Han Li was shocked, and his expression suddenly revealed a hint of strangeness, his gaze looking towards the sky.

Since he had advanced to the Great Luo realm, he could always feel an extremely heavy pressure coming from above, as if an insurmountable heavenly moat was blocking his path to advancing his time laws.

This was created by Guo or Jin, the Time Dao Ancestor, who had blocked the path of all cultivators of time laws.

However, at this moment, Han Li felt that the heavenly moat in front of him had suddenly disappeared.

"Could it be..." Han Li's heart had a guess, and his eyes flashed with excitement.

"You're all too late. I have already achieved the Great Dao, and my body has become a Chaos Body, with all laws unable to invade me. What can you do to me? Ha ha... ha ha..." Guo or Jin's calm demeanor changed, and he laughed maniacally, his eyes flashing with a crazed light.

A vast, boundless aura burst forth from Guo or Jin's body, filled with the feeling of containing all things, and various laws fluctuated within.

The largest law was the time law, and besides the time law, there were other laws mixed in.

"Guo or Jin has gone mad..." the Demon Lord's eyes narrowed, muttering.

"The power of chaos has entered his body, and Guo or Jin is still unable to fully control it, so his mind is a bit deranged. We can't let him continue, or else if he fully masters the chaos law, even if we join forces, we won't be his match!" the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth's voice echoed in Han Li and the Demon Lord's minds.

As soon as he finished speaking, he charged towards Guo or Jin.

Han Li and the Demon Lord's hearts tightened, and they followed closely behind.

Guo or Jin suddenly looked over, his expression twisted, and he raised his hands.

A massive energy seemed to pull, and the chaos vortex violently shook, as hundreds of brown arrow shadows burst forth, each one over a hundred meters long and as thick as a millstone, covering the sky and shooting towards the three.

The arrow shadows contained different laws, but there were only four.

Two of them were clearly layered, the time law and the space law, while the other two laws were merged into one, making it difficult to distinguish, but still sensing that they were the wind law and the lightning law.

The wind and lightning laws were biased towards speed, and combined with the time law and space law, the brown arrow shadows were incredibly fast, instantly crossing the distance between them and the three.

Han Li and the others were caught off guard, and were about to be struck by the arrow shadows.

"Stop!" A figure appeared in front of Han Li and the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth, and it was the Demon Lord, his hands forming a seal, pointing at the void.

As for the speed of space transformation, the Demon Lord was the fastest among the three.

The void in front of him suddenly appeared with countless silver lights, solidifying and freezing the brown arrow shadows.

However, the next moment, the arrow shadows flashed with light, and the four laws simultaneously burst forth, shattering the frozen space, and the brown arrow shadows shot out again.

With this brief moment, Han Li and the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth had already reacted, and immediately urged the spiritual realm's power, as a multitude of golden sword shadows shot out, slashing towards the arrow shadows.

The sky was filled with golden light, dark red light, and brown light, and the sound of the explosion was earth-shaking.

The space around them, which had already become nothingness, began to fluctuate again, and the chaos vortex was also affected, rolling wildly.

The brown arrow shadows carried four laws, and their power was great, but Han Li and the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth joined forces, their two great laws merged, and their power was even stronger.

The golden sword shadows quickly cut through the brown arrow shadows, shattering them, but the golden sword shadows also broke apart.

Han Li and the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth simultaneously formed a seal, and their spiritual energy and law energy surged out, pouring into the spiritual realm.

With a loud "Boom!"

The two spiritual realms rapidly expanded, covering Guo or Jin, and a multitude of massive golden sword shadows shot out, slashing towards Guo or Jin.

At the same time, Guo or Jin's other side of the void moved, and the Demon Lord's figure appeared, his finger pointing.

The void, which had already become nothingness, flashed with a silver light, and a multitude of silver fissures appeared, looking like spatial fissures.

However, these silver fissures emitted the power of spatial laws, and were much stronger than the original spatial fissures.

The Demon Lord's hands pulled, and the spatial fissures flew out, also slashing towards Guo or Jin.

The space here had already been shattered, becoming nothingness, but from another perspective, this void was also a more stable space.

The spatial fissures here were much stronger than before.

The Demon Lord's hands pulled, and the spatial fissures flew out, also slashing towards Guo or Jin.
