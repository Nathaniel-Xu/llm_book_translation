"Three thousand Grand Daos, all of them are actually in this Palm Heaven Bottle..."

Han Li's divine sense stirred, transforming into a fine dust of thoughts, and began to wander through this small bottle world.

At this time, he discovered that the various colored light clusters around him were not stationary, but were instead floating up and down along their own trajectories, slowly rotating, and this state of separate movement was the normal order of the Heavenly Dao's cycle.

After a brief flight, Han Li's heart grew anxious, how could he possibly refine these three thousand Grand Daos?

Just as he was pondering, Han Li suddenly felt a sense of resonance, and discovered that a group of colored light clusters were flashing in a special rhythm, as if they were greeting him.

He proceeded forward, and found that some of the light clusters were closely related to his own Grand Dao, and were respectively the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and the law of thunder and lightning.

As he approached the center of the small bottle space, the number of law clusters decreased, but the power of the laws they contained grew more intense, until he reached the very center, where he saw a massive, chaotic cloud cluster.

Around it, three enormous light clusters floated, colored gold, silver, and dark red.

The chaotic cloud cluster emitted a law aura that was identical to the chaotic vortex outside, and was indeed the law of chaos, while the three colored light clusters were the laws of time, space, and cycle.

The law of time was especially close to Han Li, and as he drew near, threads of time law power separated from it and flowed into his divine sense.

Han Li's divine sense, which had transformed into a mustard seed body, felt a surge of power, and his gaze shifted, and the scene around him changed.

He saw that the chaotic law extended out in countless fine threads, connecting all the light clusters of the three thousand Grand Daos, forming a massive, interconnected network.

Han Li, connected to the law of time, seemed to have become a part of this network, and his body glowed brighter.

At this moment, outside, the light clusters flying out of the cycle vortex grew more intense, pressing the six-cycle disk back.

As the light clusters gathered, the entire cycle disk grew brighter, and seemed unable to withstand the power of the chaotic law.

"Brother Shi, it's your turn." The Lord of the Cycle Temple gritted his teeth, and said.

The Demon Lord had already prepared, and was waiting for the opportunity.

Just then, the Lord of the Cycle Temple's hands changed, and the six-cycle disk opened a hole, and the chaotic light pillar, which had filled the entire disk, suddenly condensed and shot out.

This light pillar, which had been condensed by the cycle disk, was not only more solid, but also seemed more powerful.

The Demon Lord saw this, and flew forward, colliding with the light pillar, and just before impact, his hands split apart.

In front of him, a circle of silver light erupted, and a massive, spatial symbol pattern flew out, forming a spatial gate that absorbed the chaotic light pillar.

In the next instant, a spatial gate appeared beside Guo Jin, and a white light pillar shot out, striking him.

"Haha...haha..."

Guo Jin's figure was engulfed in the dazzling white light, and his laughter echoed out.

"This is not good, he's using our attack to accelerate his absorption of the chaotic law, and once his chaotic law is complete, he'll become the Chaotic Dao Ancestor, and will be able to control the chaotic vortex, and we'll be unable to defeat him." The Lord of the Cycle Temple's brow furrowed, and he immediately realized the danger.

He said, and then controlled the six-cycle disk, and once again resisted the chaotic light pillar's pressure.

The Demon Lord retreated, and glanced at Han Li, and a hint of shock appeared in his eyes.

He immediately changed his hand seals, and formed a spatial barrier, isolating Han Li, who was sitting in the air, and preventing his aura from leaking out, and being discovered by Guo Jin.

...

At the same time, inside the small bottle space.

Han Li's divine sense had transformed into a massive, white light, and seemed to contain his voice, whispering:

"The beginning of the Heavenly Dao, gives birth to the roots of all laws, the three thousand Grand Daos, were never isolated, but rather, they were always interconnected, and this is the Heavenly Dao."

In an instant, the entire small bottle space erupted, and all the law clusters began to gather towards the center.

First, the three thousand law clusters, according to their five elements, returned to their source laws, and then the five source laws gathered towards the three supreme laws, and finally, all the laws merged into one, and fused into the chaotic law.

The entire small bottle space shook, and the chaotic law cloud cluster turned green, and began to rotate intensely.

Almost at the same time, Han Li suddenly opened his eyes, and stood up from the ground.
Han Li's body rippled with a gentle wave, and the magical boundary set by the Demon Lord shattered into fragments.

His eyes shone with a colorful light, and his hands rose high into the air, holding up the Heaven's Bottle. The bottle hovered in the air, suspended by his palm.

Han Li formed a ancient hand seal, and his mouth whispered a gentle incantation: "The Great Way returns to one, collecting all things."

In the next instant, the small bottle's surface flashed with a strange light, and the various patterns etched onto it began to glow. A green light flickered at the mouth of the bottle, and a swirling vortex of dark green clouds erupted from it, forming a massive whirlpool that spanned tens of thousands of miles.

The whirlpool churned with clouds and thunder, emitting a constant rumble of thunder.

"This is... " The Demon Lord's expression changed.

"The turning point has arrived." The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth's eyes flashed with a hint of joy, and he burst into laughter.

A deafening crash shook the air! The dark green whirlpool suddenly flashed with lightning, and massive lightning whips extended from it, striking out in all directions and shattering the surrounding void.

The massive whirlpool, which was many times larger than the dark green one, seemed to resonate with it. The central light flashed rapidly, and the rotation speed increased tenfold.

 Gu Yu's gaze fell upon the dark green whirlpool, and his eyes flashed with a hint of incredulity.

He was now connected to the Chaos Law's whirlpool, and his perception of the world had long since surpassed the ordinary. At this moment, he could naturally sense the extraordinary nature of the dark green whirlpool.

His hands clasped together in front of him, and he suddenly made a grasping motion, striking out with a swift slash.

A gust of wind erupted in the void, and the Chaos whirlpool suddenly condensed into a massive, towering blade of light that slashed down towards the dark green whirlpool.

"Come on!" Han Li shouted, his voice filled with excitement.

He raised his hands, and a multitude of golden lights shot out from his palms, landing on the small bottle.

The dark green whirlpool at the mouth of the bottle suddenly surged with light, transforming into a massive, heaven-devouring beast that charged towards the massive blade of light.

The two clashed, producing a deafening crash that shook the heavens.

The blade of light sank into the whirlpool, encountering no resistance, as if it were slicing through tofu.

However, when it reached the midpoint, the dark green whirlpool began to spin at an incredible speed, and the blade of light was twisted by a massive force, wrapping around it like a rope.

The twisted blade of light formed a bridge connecting the two whirlpools, and the two massive whirlpools began to churn and rumble like thunder.

A massive, swirling cloud of Chaos energy erupted from the Chaos whirlpool, and a green mist rose from the dark green whirlpool, entwining like a pair of dragons.

The two clouds of energy clashed, transforming into a swirling vortex of smoke and clouds that seemed to have no end.

However, the Chaos whirlpool suddenly surged with energy, and the rotation speed increased dramatically, stirring up the surrounding void into chaos.

The dark green whirlpool, which was much smaller, seemed to be at a disadvantage, and its power was being drained by the Chaos whirlpool.

"Bad, the Chaos whirlpool has already consumed almost all of the spiritual energy of the Middle Earth Realm, and is even drawing in energy from other realms. Its power has grown, and the Heaven's Bottle's might seems insufficient..." The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth's eyes widened in concern.

"Please, assist me!" Han Li shouted, his voice echoing through the void.

His body was now surrounded by a dense, golden aura, and the power of the Time Law surged out from him, pouring into the small bottle.

The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth and the Demon Lord exchanged a glance, and without hesitation, they began to channel their own Law energies into the Heaven's Bottle.

In this vast expanse, only a few scattered fragments of the realms remained, like lost domains drifting in the void. Three massive pillars of light rose from Han Li and the two others, forming a Triune alignment.

The Heaven's Bottle, infused with the combined power of the three Laws, began to shake violently, its surface flashing with symbols. The bottle's body began to expand rapidly, eventually growing to the size of a treasure tower.

The mouth of the bottle glowed with a brilliant light, and a multitude of Law energies swirled out, forming a massive, green gemstone that flew towards the void.

"Senior Bottle Spirit..." Han Li's voice whispered, as he saw the figure of the Bottle Spirit.

As he spoke, the Bottle Spirit guided the Law energies, which began to merge and combine, forming a magnificent, seven-colored aura that transformed into a resplendent, rainbow-colored ribbon.

A strange, yet familiar, aura emanated from the ribbon, filling the air with an air of contradiction.
