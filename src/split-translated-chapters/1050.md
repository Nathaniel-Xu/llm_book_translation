The Ice Sculpture's words had barely faded away when the Pure Flame Firebird let out another clear cry, its wings spreading wide as it charged upwards.

The already fallen Profound Ice Slash Sword was immediately struck with great force, all the blue light threads being repelled back, and the sword body once again disappeared into the circular symbol.

The Pure Flame Firebird's divine might was fully displayed, but it didn't stop, its body behind it radiating flames that surged out like a peacock's tail, shooting out numerous silver fireballs that continuously struck the blue light barrier of the Ling Domain that the Blue siblings had merged into.

The Ling Domain barrier immediately became unstable, and with a great tremor, cracks began to appear.

A moment later, the sound of shattering ice crystals rang out, and the five statues of indeterminate sex on the ice sculptures all appeared with cracks, suddenly shattering with a loud cracking sound.

Immediately after, the Ling Domain barrier also dissipated, but the Blue siblings' auras had also disappeared.

Han Li, who had escaped, still felt the chill in his body, his limbs somewhat numb.

He stretched out his hand, and the Pure Flame Firebird immediately flew back, landing on his shoulder.

Han Li only felt a warmth on his shoulder, a warm flow spreading throughout his body, the chill on his skin slowly seeping out and disappearing.

He swept his gaze around, only to see that all the metal beasts had hidden themselves, the advance team members who had entered with him had all been annihilated, not a single one surviving.

The Vice Pavilion Master Zhao had been torn into two pieces by the metal beasts, and Yu Kuohai had been affected by the cold aura, leaning against a golden stone pillar, already frozen to death.

Han Li's face sank, and he patted the Pure Flame Firebird on the shoulder, putting it away, before striding towards the depths of the space.

Since the other party was truly the Blue siblings sent by the Heavenly Court, and had discovered his tracks here, he had to quickly get rid of them, if he let them return to the Heavenly Court, his situation would become even more troublesome.

â€¦

Outside the stone gate, the crowd waited for a long time, seeing that there was no movement inside, each person's expression was strange, as they looked inside.

"We can't wait any longer, we'll go in too." Jin Liucheng said after a long time.

The other sect members heard this and looked at each other, no one moving.

After all, the commotion inside earlier was too terrifying, making them still a bit apprehensive.

"Inside, the movement has stopped for a long time, the advance team probably passed through on their own, if we don't hurry, we'll be left with nothing but dust." Jin Liucheng's face turned cold, saying.

The crowd heard this, their expressions changing, revealing a bit of hesitation.

Jin Liucheng looked at Su Zhenzhen, and the two of them took the lead, stepping over the stone gate and entering.

The rest of the people followed.

Everyone felt the influence of the Golden Force Field as they entered, each person's expression twisting in discomfort.

But when they walked a short distance, their expressions all changed to shock and terror, seeing that the surroundings were a mess, with corpses and debris everywhere, looking like a hellish scene.

"What happened here..." Fu Guizhu's face turned pale, muttering to himself.

His words had barely faded away when he suddenly looked up, his eyes fixed on a golden stone pillar above him in shock.

A metal beast, shaped like a wolf, suddenly pounced down from above, its speed like lightning, pressing him down.

Immediately, metal beasts appeared one after another, a fierce battle cry ringing out...

At the same time, Han Li had already arrived at a stone gate in the depths of the space.

The gate was half-open, clearly the Blue siblings had escaped inside.

Han Li's divine sense swept the surroundings, and he also flashed inside.

Only to see that outside the gate was a spacious hall, with no decorations, only a wide black stone staircase that spiralled upwards.

Han Li followed the staircase, the staircase ending at a dark red light gate, which seemed to be a space transmission gate, unknown where it led.

He carefully probed with his divine sense, but his divine sense couldn't penetrate, nor could he sense the situation inside.

He hesitated for a moment, then flashed inside.

Han Li only felt a flash of light, and appeared in a scarlet world.

This place was completely different from the first layer, a vast open space, with a dark red sky floating with red clouds, the surroundings an endless scarlet desert, filled with an intense heat.

Behind him, a tall stone gate stood, with a black light screen in the middle, slightly undulating.

Next to the stone gate stood a stone stele, with a giant "2" character written on it, the font majestic and powerful.

Han Li instinctively swept his divine sense around, finding that this place was different from the first layer, his divine sense restricted, but able to barely expand.

The Blue siblings were still nowhere to be seen, but the remnants of their auras still lingered in the air, fleeing into the distance.

Han Li confirmed that there was nothing unusual in the surroundings, and immediately flew out, transforming into a golden rainbow, chasing after the two.

"Ah!"

He flashed out, immediately feeling a special restriction in the air, emitting a time force fluctuation, limiting his speed to only half of his normal speed.

"This restriction is similar to my Time Domain, but my domain doesn't restrict the range of my divine sense..." Han Li thought in surprise, but quickly didn't think about it, reversing his True Wheel divine ability.

Since this restriction was related to time laws, reversing the True Wheel should be effective.
Whoosh!

As expected, once he activated the Inverted True Wheel, the golden rainbow's speed suddenly increased, almost restoring it to its original speed, and shot forward in pursuit.

However, just a moment later, the escaping lights of Lan Yuanzi and Lan Yan appeared within Han Li's spiritual sense range.

The two of them were dressed in tattered and charred clothing, their auras weakened compared to before, as if they had been burned by intense flames.

Lan Yuanzi and Lan Yan were currently fleeing towards the distance, but their speed was also slower than usual, as if they had been slowed down by about half.

Han Li's golden rainbow surged once more, chasing after the two of them like lightning, and the distance between them rapidly closed.

"No, that Han kid is catching up!" Lan Yuanzi and Lan Yan sensed the situation behind them and were shocked.

"Brother!" Lan Yan immediately looked at Lan Yuanzi.

Lan Yuanzi didn't hesitate, and the two of them clasped their hands together, chanting in unison.

A stream of law energy burst out from their bodies, merging together.

Their escaping lights also intertwined and surged, forming a massive blue bird-like shape, hundreds of meters in size, with rapidly flapping wings, increasing their speed by about half.

Although Lan Yuanzi and Lan Yan had used their secret technique to increase their speed, they were still far inferior to Han Li.

The distance between them rapidly closed, and soon they were only a dozen or so miles apart.

"This guy's speed is too fast!" Lan Yan looked at Han Li, who was rapidly approaching, and turned to Lan Yuanzi with a panicked expression.

"I'll hold him back, you go first!" Lan Yuanzi's eyes flashed, and with a sudden determination, he pushed Lan Yan forward, sending him flying towards the distance, while he turned to face Han Li.

"Brother!" Lan Yan cried out, his body flashing with light, and he immediately stabilized his form, intending to turn back.

"Idiot, do you want to waste all our hard work? Hurry up and go! Don't worry about me, I have my own way to survive!" Lan Yuanzi transmitted a furious roar.

As he spoke, he raised his hands, and a white, dragon-embroidered flag appeared in one hand, while a blue, flame-filled cauldron appeared in the other.

He swung his hands, and the two objects shot out.

The white flag flashed with blue light, transforming into a hundred-meter-long, blue and white dragon, which spat out a blast of blue energy that enveloped Han Li.

The energy was mixed with chunks of white ice crystals, which collided with each other, producing a deafening roar, and the air trembled with the force of the attack.

The cauldron spun around, releasing a wave of blue ice flames that engulfed Han Li, freezing the air around him.

The range of the attack was enormous, almost blocking off the entire sky.

The originally dry and scorching environment was suddenly transformed into a frozen wasteland, with the temperature plummeting.

Lan Yan stood still, his eyes welling up with tears, his lips trembling, but he eventually turned to flee.

Han Li's fleeing form stopped, and he raised his hand.

A green light shot out from his sleeve, rapidly expanding and splitting into two massive, green hands that inserted themselves into the dragon's energy blast and the blue ice flames.

The energy blast and ice flames halted just ten meters in front of Han Li, then dissipated like bubbles.

Han Li stood, his hands grasping the white flag and blue cauldron, which were still struggling to break free.

But Lan Yuanzi's figure had disappeared.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he formed a hand seal.

The green light flashed, and the two artifacts flew back into his sleeve, and he shot forward, chasing after Lan Yan, who was still visible in the distance.

Just then, the air in front of him began to distort, producing a rumbling sound like thunder.

A series of blue, crack-like markings appeared, filling the air with a dense, blue glow that surged towards Han Li.

Han Li was engulfed by the blue light, as if he were in a raging storm.

His fleeing form halted, and he was sent flying backward, his brow furrowed in concern, as a brilliant, golden light erupted from his body, stabilizing him.

But before Han Li could react, the blue light around him rapidly coalesced into a massive, blue sphere, hundreds of meters in size.

The sphere's interior was filled with churning, blue energy, which was exerting a powerful, law-based pressure on Han Li from all sides.

The surrounding space energy was also being compressed, making it difficult for Han Li to move.

However, Han Li's physical body was incredibly resilient, and he adapted to the pressure in just a few breaths, regaining his mobility.

A purple light flashed in his eyes, and he formed a hand seal.

He shot out a crystal-like, chain-like energy that was unaffected by the surrounding pressure, rapidly disappearing into the distance.

"Whoosh!"

A figure was dragged out of the void, bound by the crystal chain, and it was Lan Yuanzi.

His body was radiating an intense, blue light, as if it were burning, and it was filled with powerful, law-based energy.

(Hey, fellow cultivators, sorry about this! I've got some stuff to take care of, so I'll only be updating once a day for the next two days.
