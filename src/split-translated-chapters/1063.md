Han Li sat cross-legged, regulating his breathing, when suddenly a fierce battle erupted nearby between the Wailing Soul and the Ghost King of the Dark Nest.

The Wailing Soul dodged a large cluster of razor-sharp claws and let out a deafening roar. Its body began to swell, and golden and silver symbols emerged from its skin, releasing powerful waves of energy.

At the same time, the Wailing Soul's third eye flashed, and a thick, blood-red beam of light shot out, striking the Ghost King.

The Ghost King's eyes flickered with a hint of fear, and he summoned dozens of shadowy figures to merge with his body. He then waved his sleeve, unleashing a massive cloud of black mist.

From the mist, a bony claw emerged, and a crimson glow appeared on its palm. A blood-red face materialized, with jagged teeth and sharp horns, looking ferocious.

The Ghost King's mouth opened, revealing a dark vortex that rotated wildly. The Wailing Soul's blood-red beam was absorbed by the vortex, and the two energies clashed.

Meanwhile, the Ghost King pressed his hand against the ground, and a strange, ancient symbol appeared, disappearing into the earth.

Suddenly, a circle of blood-red light appeared beneath the Wailing Soul, and a blood pool began to spread rapidly. The Wailing Soul tried to dodge, but its feet were rooted to the spot by an unseen force.

The blood pool's surface churned and bubbled, releasing a noxious stench, and the Wailing Soul's legs were quickly submerged. The pool's interior was filled with thousands of blood-red ghosts, which clawed and crawled towards the Wailing Soul.

The Wailing Soul's body was covered in black smoke, but it managed to resist the attack due to its robust physique. However, the battle had reached a stalemate.

Han Li, who had been meditating, suddenly opened his eyes and leapt to his feet. He gazed at the Ghost King, and his wrist twitched, summoning the thirty-six Cloud-Sword blades. He charged forward, but a sudden, intense energy wave erupted from the shadows.

A figure emerged from the darkness, its presence masked by the night. It lunged at Han Li with a palm strike.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and his body flashed with a brilliant light. He vanished, reappearing hundreds of feet away. However, the attacker's hand remained, and a blazing golden fire erupted from its palm, encasing Han Li in a fiery prison.

"Qi Mozi!" Han Li exclaimed, recognizing the attacker.

Qi Mozi's face was twisted in a snarl. Han Li sensed a disruption in the flow of time and felt a chill run down his spine. A golden wheel appeared behind him, radiating intense light and releasing a barrage of golden energy beams.

The beams clashed with the flames, creating a void that slowed down time. The golden light dissipated, but the flames continued to rage.

The Wailing Soul, still trapped in the blood pool, saw Qi Mozi's attack and wanted to intervene. However, it was bound by the Ghost King's magic and couldn't escape.

Qi Mozi sneered, "You've grown stronger since our last meeting, but you're still no match for me. Today, I'll eliminate you and prevent future troubles."

The flames intensified, pushing back the golden light and encroaching on Han Li's surroundings.

Han Li let out a mighty roar, and his body glowed with energy. He summoned the power of the Heavenly Executioner's Prison, and his fist struck the air, countering Qi Mozi's attack.
Han Li's fists burst forth with a brilliant starlight that exploded into a snow-white light screen, compressing the air and pressing forward, layer by layer, until the space in front of him began to distort and break apart, pushing towards Qi Mozi.

"Boom! Boom! Boom!"

The air was filled with the sound of explosions as the light screen compressed the space, and countless golden flames were absorbed into the distortion, momentarily relieving the pressure of the golden light.

Han Li seized the opportunity to raise his hand and swing it, unleashing thirty-six Qingtian Bee Cloud Swords that scattered from his back, shooting upwards with a piercing cry, transforming into sword energy trails that vanished into thin air.

However, in the blink of an eye, the Qingtian Bee Cloud Swords flew back from the distant sky, their tips pointing directly at Qi Mozi's back, with golden electric threads crackling on their surface as they rapidly approached.

Just as they were about to reach Qi Mozi, a sheet of golden flames suddenly emerged from the void, pinning the swords in mid-air, even freezing the golden lightning on their surface.

Qi Mozi's palm swept out in a fierce motion, accompanied by a loud roar.

A golden light flashed before him, and a burning torch materialized out of thin air.

"No!"

Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he hastily withdrew the True Speech Treasure Wheel into his body.

The next instant, the flames on the torch's surface began to spread, releasing a wave of light that rippled through the air, causing everything in the void to come to a standstill, frozen in time.

Han Li had released his Time Domain in the same instant, and withdrawn the True Speech Treasure Wheel into his body, rapidly reversing its rotation. However, he still couldn't escape the pursuit of the flame's light, and was enveloped by it after a mere two breaths.

In an instant, Han Li's body slowed to a crawl, although he wasn't completely immobile like before, he still appeared powerless.

Moreover, without the protection of the Thunder Array, even if he could momentarily break free, he wouldn't be able to escape.

However, Han Li's cultivation breakthrough wasn't entirely useless, and despite his slow movements, he could still move, and his thoughts weren't completely hindered by the time constraint.

The next instant, a silver light flashed on Han Li's body, and a layer of silver flames slowly spread out, covering his body like a suit of armor, emitting a powerful fire attribute law force.

As the silver flames appeared, the void around Han Li seemed to distort and become illusory, and the flame's light that fell upon it was even repelled.

"How is this possible? Can the Five Elements Law really shake the Supreme Law?" Qi Mozi exclaimed, his eyes wide with shock.

With a sweep of his hand, the black short axe flew out once more, transforming into a dark light that shot towards Han Li.

This time, without the True Speech Treasure Wheel's golden ripples to block it, the black short axe pierced through the layers of flames and struck Han Li, who was enveloped by the golden flames.

Just as the axe was about to land on Han Li, a layer of golden sand particles condensed from the air, blocking the axe's path, and a golden gourd appeared above Han Li's head, releasing a wave of golden liquid that wrapped around the axe's handle.

The axe blade was trapped in the golden sand, as if stuck in a time vortex, and no matter how hard it tried, it couldn't break through the sand and land on Han Li.

The golden liquid from the gourd even corroded the axe's handle, causing it to decay and rot.

As the axe was bound and unable to move, Qi Mozi's expression turned even colder.

He took a step forward, his foot stepping on the void, and approached Han Li, whose Time Domain had little effect on him.

Qi Mozi's body drew closer, and the golden torch floating before him also drew nearer, its flames intensifying as they pressed down on Han Li.

The silver flames on Han Li's body surged wildly, but his ability to resist the flames was weakening.

Han Li's throat let out a hoarse cry as he poured all his energy into the Five Elements Illusory World Technique, causing his body to shine with a brilliant golden light.

His True Speech Treasure Wheel, the Time-Reversing Flowing Fire, and the Eastern Yi Divine Wood all appeared at the same time, releasing their respective powers.

The five time law objects, each with its own unique fluctuations, released a wave of energy that resonated with each other, but unlike before, they didn't form a unified golden ring.

As a result, the five powers remained separate, unable to stop Qi Mozi's approach.

But just as they thought that was the end, a shocking scene unfolded, leaving both Qi Mozi and Han Li stunned!
