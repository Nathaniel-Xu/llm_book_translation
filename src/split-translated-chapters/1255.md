"Not bad, I and my friend Chi Meng saw the people from the Wheel of Reincarnation entering the depths of the Nine Yuan Observatory, and out of consideration for the relationship between our two factions, we were worried that they might do something unfavorable to the Nine Yuan Observatory, so we followed them all the way here." Hao Yuan said with a serious expression.

Pure Jun True Person snorted coldly and didn't believe a word of what the two said, but didn't press them further.

Chi Meng and Hao Yuan both had extremely deep backgrounds, and Chi Meng, as a prominent figure in the Heavenly Court, had a powerful backer in the form of the Red Fusion Dao Ancestor, who was known for his short temper. Even if Chi Meng had done something, Pure Jun True Person wouldn't dare to do anything to her, at most just scolding her a few times.

As for Hao Yuan, he was the current master of the Hundred Forge Mountain, and the Hundred Forge Mountain's influence extended to all the major immortal domains in the True Immortal Realm. Although there was no Dao Ancestor backing him, his relationship with the Heavenly Court was extremely close. Over the years, any force that dared to take action against the Hundred Forge Mountain had ended in disaster, and many people considered the Hundred Forge Mountain to be the Heavenly Court's vassal.

The current situation of the Nine Yuan Observatory was delicate, and Pure Jun True Person, as the main person in charge, naturally didn't want to provoke a conflict between the Nine Yuan Observatory and the Hundred Forge Mountain. Moreover, if they were to pressure the two too much, it would be bad if they were to join forces with the Wheel of Reincarnation.

"Alright, since you two are not related to the Wheel of Reincarnation, please step aside and wait for a moment. After we deal with these thieves from the Wheel of Reincarnation, we'll let you leave." Pure Jun True Person said.

Chi Meng and Hao Yuan heard this and secretly breathed a sigh of relief, nodding and floating to the side of the great hall.

Although they both had powerful backgrounds, they were currently within the Nine Yuan Observatory, and their powers were limited. If Pure Jun True Person were to take action against them, they could only surrender.

"Hao Yuan, is that five-colored small bottle the one that was crafted by the previous master of the Hundred Forge Mountain, the Hundred Refine Immortal?" Chi Meng asked in a low voice.

The two stood shoulder to shoulder, their expressions no longer hostile.

"The small bottle indeed has the aura of the Hundred Forge Mountain's refining technique, it should be the one crafted by the Hundred Refine Immortal. However, back then, the Hundred Refine Immortal only crafted the embryo, and it seems that the Nine Yuan Observatory has performed a second refinement, and it's already greatly different from its original appearance, almost unrecognizable." Hao Yuan replied in a low voice.

"This treasure indeed looks extraordinary... In your opinion, Hao Yuan, what does the Nine Yuan Observatory plan to do with this treasure?" Chi Meng asked again.

"Who knows what kind of trick Pure Jun is playing, only by taking this treasure and researching it can we understand what the Nine Yuan Observatory is really up to." Hao Yuan said after a moment of thought.

Chi Meng heard this and turned to look at the people from the Wheel of Reincarnation, her beautiful eyes flashing with thoughts.

Han Li saw Pure Jun True Person easily brush off Chi Meng and Hao Yuan, and secretly thought him to be formidable.

He immediately furrowed his brow, thinking of a plan.

At this moment, if he were to use the Palm of Heaven Bottle to travel through time and space, he would definitely be able to escape, but Nangong Wanyu had completely forgotten about him, and seemed to have a hostile attitude towards him. It was unlikely that she would be willing to leave with him.

With Wu Yang, Jiao San, and others present, it was clear that they wouldn't allow him to forcibly take Nangong Wanyu away.

Han Li's mind was racing with thoughts, and his brow suddenly twitched as he looked at Wu Yang.

Wu Yang's face was cold and stern, but his lips were moving imperceptibly.

And beside him, Jiao San, Lu Chuanfeng, and others were also moving their ears, seemingly discussing something in secret.

Shi Kongmo also looked at them, his eyes focused, clearly participating in the conversation.

Han Li saw this and felt a pang of annoyance.

He was, after all, a member of the Wheel of Reincarnation, and Jiao San, Wu Yang, and others were discussing something without including him, making it clear that they didn't consider him one of their own.

Although he couldn't do anything about it, he couldn't help but feel that since he had joined the organization, he had been manipulated by an invisible hand, making him feel like he couldn't completely cut ties with them.

Especially when he saw Nangong Wanyu appear in front of him, this feeling grew stronger.

It seemed that after this matter was resolved, he would have to investigate thoroughly.

He wasn't someone who liked being controlled, and his own destiny had to be in his own hands.

Pure Jun True Person saw Chi Meng and Hao Yuan retreat to the side, and snorted coldly in his heart, his expression unchanged as he turned to look at Wu Yang and the others.

Just as he was about to say something, the people from the Wheel of Reincarnation suddenly erupted into action.

Shi Kongmo and Lu Chuanfeng transformed into a black and blue light, flying towards the three people.

Shi Kongmo pinched his fingers, and a series of black sword shadows flew out from his fingertips, slashing towards Pure Jun True Person and the others.

Each sword shadow had a black magic eye on it, flashing with black light, looking extremely sinister.

The sword shadows flew out, but not a single sword cry was heard, as if the black swords were not physical.

Lu Chuanfeng spat out a blue light, his hands moving in a wheel-like motion.

A series of five-colored talismans flew out from his hands, striking the blue light in front of him.

The blue light suddenly exploded, transforming into countless thin blue ice needles.

"Go!" Lu Chuanfeng pinched his fingers, shouting loudly.

The blue ice needles shot out like a strong bow, filling the air with a piercing whistling sound, striking Pure Jun True Person and the others with a terrifying force.
"Hmph, a desperate struggle!"

Chun Jun Zhenren saw the two's fierce attack, but he didn't flinch, instead, he sneered and rubbed his hands together, and two golden lights flew out from his hands, hitting the walls on either side of the grand hall.

Yang Junzi and Lei Jun Zhenren also quickly activated their tokens, and golden lights shot out from them, merging with the golden lights on the walls.

The layer of golden light inside the grand hall suddenly fluctuated violently, and golden lights shot out from within, instantly blocking the three people and rolling towards Shi Kongmo and Lu Chuanfeng like a wave.

Lu Chuanfeng's ice needles hit the golden lights, but they disappeared without a trace, like a mud cow entering the sea.

Shi Kongmo's black sword shadows had form but no substance, and they broke through several layers of golden light, but they also quickly dimmed.

"Ah, what a powerful Spirit Devouring Seal, it can actually devour the law of the Heart Demon Sword!" Shi Kongmo exclaimed, his face filled with surprise.

At the same time, he changed his hand seals.

The black sword shadows also changed, transforming into thin black threads that pierced through the layers of golden light, continuing to shoot towards Chun Jun Zhenren.

Perhaps due to their smaller size, the black threads pierced through the golden light, although they still dimmed, but at a slower rate, and soon approached Chun Jun Zhenren and the others.

Chun Jun Zhenren and the others quickly retreated, activating the golden lights around them to counterattack.

Lu Chuanfeng waved his hands, and blue lights flashed around him, emitting a cold aura.

"Ka" "Ka" sounds echoed, as large blue ice crystals the size of houses shot out from his hands, emitting a piercing shriek, and crashed into the approaching golden lights.

The golden lights seemed to be slower when devouring the spiritual energy within physical objects, and were immediately pierced by the blue ice crystals, becoming riddled with holes, and unable to approach Shi Kongmo and Lu Chuanfeng.

Jiao San, Wu Yang, and the black-clothed girl turned around and rushed towards a wall of the grand hall at the same time Shi Kongmo and Lu Chuanfeng made their move.

"Brother Han, I have a way to break through this place, please lend me a hand!" Jiao San's voice echoed in Han Li's ear.

Han Li's eyes flashed, and he followed Jiao San and the others, landing in front of the wall of the grand hall.

From afar, Yang Junzi saw this scene, and his face changed, as he pointed at the wall where Han Li and the others were, and activated his seal.

The golden light on the wall suddenly brightened, and a hissing sound accompanied it, as numerous golden lights shot out from within, merging into giant golden tentacles that rolled towards the group.

"We'll block these tentacles and give Jiao San time!" Wu Yang shouted, taking the lead, and a golden greatsword appeared in his hand.

The sword had a pattern of mountains and rivers on one side, and the stars and constellations on the other, and it emitted a brilliant golden light, as if it was extraordinary.

Wu Yang swung his sword, and a hundred-meter-long sword energy shot out, slicing through the tentacles.

The tentacles were flexible and agile, and they quickly wrapped around the sword energy, devouring the spiritual energy within.

The sword energy quickly shrunk, and its light dimmed, and it was eventually absorbed into the golden tentacles.

"Be careful, these tentacles can devour spiritual energy and law!" Wu Yang warned, as he swung his sword again, slicing through more tentacles.

The black-clothed girl and Wu Yang attacked at the same time, and she took out two snake-shaped long knives.

She swung her knives, and curved, dark red lights shot out, slicing through the tentacles, and severing seven or eight of them.

But the golden tentacles were relentless, and they quickly devoured the dark red lights, which contained the law of reincarnation.

Han Li saw this scene, and his hands shook.

His arms glowed with starlight, and his fingers expanded, as he activated his Xuan Qi.

Han Li's arms swelled, and his fingers lengthened, as he shot out a series of white energy blades, slicing through the remaining tentacles.

The tentacles were easily sliced through, and they were swept away, as if they had no resistance.
