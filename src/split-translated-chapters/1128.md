Just as the situation was unfolding, a white whirlwind swept in from the distance, and Liqima arrived in a flash, standing before Qimozhi.

On his back, a figure suddenly leapt down, and it was Han Li.

His body radiated dazzling golden light, and the true word treasure wheel spun with a loud whoosh, while the Time Cleansing Vessel floated above, releasing a sea of illusory sand that embodied the laws of time. All of these objects surrounded Qimozhi.

Almost simultaneously, the five Time Law Embodiments on the surface of the objects shone brightly, and threads of Time Law crystals shot out, merging and burning in mid-air, releasing a dazzling five-colored fusion light.

Qimozhi's expression froze in terror, and his face was petrified in an instant.

Next, his body began to float with layer upon layer of illusory shadows, and countless identical versions of himself appeared.

The first of these illusory shadows disintegrated, crumbling into dust and disappearing.

At this point, everyone, including Liu Ziyuan and Qu Lin, hovered hundreds of feet away, watching the shocking scene unfold before their eyes, and no one dared to approach.

Because they all discovered that Qimozhi's body was undergoing a terrifying transformation. His cultivation aura was slowly dissipating, and he was falling from the Great Luo Realm to the Taiyi Realm.

Han Li's situation wasn't much better. The five-colored fusion light seemed to have consumed too much energy, and it was gradually fading away.

Just as the five-colored fusion light disappeared, Han Li let out a loud roar:

"Old man, the time has come!"

As he spoke, his true spirit blood vessels and the Tianxia Town Prison Technique began to circulate, and a dark light enveloped his body. His figure transformed into a three-headed, six-armed demon, and he launched a punch and a claw at Qimozhi's dantian and heart.

Two muffled sounds echoed through the air.

The dragon claw formed from the true dragon blood vessels tore open Qimozhi's chest and crushed his heart, but the massive fist formed from the mountain giant ape was unable to pierce Qimozhi's dantian.

"The Great Luo Realm's physical body is indeed powerful..."

Han Li sighed inwardly, intending to strike again and destroy Qimozhi's dantian. But just as he was about to do so, a sudden change occurred.

A scorching aura burst forth from Qimozhi's dantian, and hundreds of fiery insects poured out, charging towards Han Li.

The area affected by the insects was instantly scorched, and Han Li's arm withered away.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat, and a small, silver figure with seven-colored flames appeared on his shoulder. It dove forward, transforming into a silver flame that engulfed Han Li's arm and the insects.

In that brief moment, a golden thread of Time Law crystals shot out from Qimozhi's dantian, wrapping around a small, golden figure with a resentful expression. It vanished in an instant, reappearing thousands of feet away.

Hou San saw this and was about to give chase, but Liu Ziyuan stopped him.

"He's using most of the Time Law crystals to escape with his nascent soul. Even Liqima can't catch up. Don't waste your energy."

Han Li's arm was still infested with the insects, but he reached out with his other hand and removed the storage ring and storage bracelet from Qimozhi's hand. He didn't refine or put them away.

On the other side, the Suiyue God Lamp, which no one had activated, returned to its original state and was put away by Hou San.

When everyone gathered together, Hou San spoke up, "Brother Han, as we agreed earlier..."

"I only wanted the Suiyue God Lamp, and that's all," Han Li replied, nodding his head. He tossed the storage ring and storage bracelet to Hou San.

Hou San was taken aback, then smiled faintly and handed the Suiyue God Lamp to Han Li.

The two of them each took the objects and examined them for a moment before putting them away.

"Brother Han, now that you've obtained the Suiyue God Lamp, my lifebound token should be returned to me, right?" Liqima asked, jogging up to Han Li.

Han Li was about to respond when a loud rumbling sound shook the air, and the entire void seemed to tremble.

Everyone's hearts skipped a beat as they turned to look at the area where the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor and the others were fighting.

A black light and a golden light were clashing at incredible speeds, causing the heavens and earth to shake with each impact.

The area near the Suiyue Palace had collapsed, and the void was torn apart, revealing a massive spatial rift that stretched across the sky. The entire seventh layer of space was in turmoil.

Fortunately, the spatial rifts were absorbing the shockwaves from the battle, preventing the seventh layer from collapsing.

The spatial rifts seemed to have no effect on the two combatants, who were fighting at the edge of the rifts.
A deafening crash echoed through the air as the two beams of light suddenly parted, revealing the figures of Hei Tian Mo Zu and Jin Se Canshen.

"Hahaha! Exhilarating, exhilarating! It's been a long time since I've had such a thrilling fight!" Hei Tian Mo Zu laughed loudly, his black aura surging to new heights, enveloping half the sky and spreading outward in all directions.

Jin Se Canshen's golden aura also burst forth, clashing with the opposing black aura.

However, Jin Se Canshen's body had become much thinner, and the golden aura surrounding him was significantly dimmer than Hei Tian Mo Zu's black aura, which had enveloped him.

The remaining black aura continued to surge outward, spreading in all directions.

Han Li and the others, despite being far away, were still affected by Hei Tian Mo Zu's black aura.

"Thud, thud"

Their internal spiritual energy suddenly became chaotic, their hearts racing wildly, as if on the verge of explosion. Their vision also began to blur and distort, as if they were falling into an endless nightmare.

This was the sign of a heart demon eruption, which was impossible to suppress!

"Heart Demon Suppression Technique!"

Han Li's face turned pale as he hastily activated the remaining temporal law energy within him, protecting his entire body while flying away in a distant direction.

However, his internal spiritual energy was in a state of extreme turmoil, reducing his flying speed to less than 10% of its normal speed.

Moreover, the normally reliable temporal law, which had protected him, suddenly lost its effect, failing to suppress the heart demon's eruption.

Liu Zi, Jiao San, and the others also hastily activated their own law energies to protect themselves, flying away in a distant direction. However, their situations seemed to be the same.

Fortunately, the black aura had spread to Han Li and the others, and did not continue to expand further.

Although their flying speed was slow, they were able to escape the black aura's range, and the raging heart demon suddenly dissipated, restoring their spiritual energy to normal.

The group continued to fly a distance before stopping, their faces filled with shock and awe as they gazed at the towering black aura behind them. Liu Zi, Qu Lin, and Li Qi Ma's eyes also flashed with a hint of despair.

They had always known that their strength was far inferior to Hei Tian Mo Zu's, but they had not expected the difference to be so vast. Hei Tian Mo Zu had not even opened his spiritual domain, yet his law energy had still left them powerless.

If they were to engage in a life-or-death battle, they would likely be unable to withstand even a single move from Hei Tian Mo Zu, even if they joined forces.

Han Li gazed at the distant black aura, his eyes flashing with uncertainty, as if lost in thought.

Within the dense black aura, Jin Se Canshen's golden aura had been compressed to a range of several hundred feet, forming a dazzling golden light sphere.

The surrounding black aura churned and surged, slowly compressing the golden light sphere.

"Alas, you old man now only have a wisp of residual soul, and can't even unleash a fraction of your strength. It's pointless to continue fighting... Ah, forget it!" Hei Tian Mo Zu sighed, his right hand extending as a dark aura erupted from his palm, striking the void.

The golden light sphere surrounding Jin Se Canshen rippled, as nine enormous black palm prints suddenly appeared, each emitting an aura of nothingness ten times stronger than before. The black energy enveloped the surrounding void, causing it to distort and shatter.

The nine black palm prints transformed and struck the golden light sphere, instantly shattering it and sending Jin Se Canshen stumbling backward.

The nine palm prints paused, then continued to strike downward, but Jin Se Canshen's body suddenly rotated, unleashing ten long, crystal-like golden flames that shot out from his body.

Each golden flame emitted an extraordinary temporal law energy, incinerating the surrounding void as it passed through.

After unleashing the ten flames, Jin Se Canshen's already dim body became even more translucent, almost invisible.

Nine of the golden flames clashed with the nine black palm prints, producing a deafening crash as the palm prints were halted.

The final golden flame shot outward, tearing through the surrounding black aura and heading toward Han Li and the others.

The group was shocked, hastily scattering in all directions.

Han Li also retreated, but the Sui Yue God Lamp in his hand suddenly burst forth with light, stopping in mid-air as if rooted to the spot. Despite his efforts to pull it back, the lamp remained still, its surface etched with flickering, swirling runes.

A burst of golden flames erupted from the lamp, each flame transforming into a fire lotus that rotated and merged with the others, forming a sea of golden flames in an instant.

Han Li's face turned pale as he hastily released the lamp, disappearing from the spot before reappearing thousands of miles away, his brow furrowed in concern.

The Sui Yue God Lamp, which he had only just obtained, was now on the verge of being taken from him once again?
