Just as the 36 Qingtong Flying Cloud Swords and the Tongtian Sword Diagram merged, the surface of the sword diagram suddenly emitted a loud "boom" and released a powerful devouring force.

The 36 Qingtong Flying Cloud Swords disappeared into thin air, and the surrounding lightning sword energy also vanished instantly, all of which was absorbed into the Tongtian Sword Diagram.

Han Li's eyes widened in shock as he witnessed this scene.

At this moment, his face suddenly changed, as the immortal spiritual energy within him surged out like a flood, being absorbed by the Tongtian Sword Diagram, with almost 30% of it being drained in an instant.

Not only that, the surrounding heavenly energy also gathered and poured into the Tongtian Sword Diagram.

Furthermore, the void around the Tongtian Sword Diagram began to flash, and thick lightning bolts appeared in the air, also merging into the sword diagram.

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise as he saw this, but he didn't stop the sword diagram from devouring his immortal spiritual energy, instead continuing to stimulate the sword diagram with all his might.

At this moment, outside the Eight Wastes Mountain, the sky was filled with a massive commotion, with thick black clouds gathering and covering the entire sky.

Suddenly, a strong wind began to blow, and thick lightning snakes appeared in the clouds, accompanied by thunderous roars.

These thick lightning bolts emitted a powerful aura, unlike ordinary lightning, and seemed to be imbued with the power of the laws of lightning.

The massive commotion was naturally noticed by the various tribes of the Eight Wastes Mountain.

The tribes' members flew out of their respective locations, pointing and discussing the black clouds and lightning in the sky.

"What's happening? Why is the sky suddenly filled with black clouds?"

"Is it that fellow's cultivation advancing, and he's about to undergo a lightning tribulation?"

"I don't think so, this lightning cloud's aura is too strange, it doesn't seem like a lightning tribulation, but rather some kind of divine power causing a heavenly upheaval!"

The various tribes members speculated about the cause of the black clouds and lightning, but couldn't come to a conclusion, and were relieved that the black clouds and lightning didn't descend.

Soon, the great elders of the various tribes were alerted and began to investigate the source of the black clouds and lightning using their magical powers.

However, their investigation was blocked by a powerful time law force.

This time law force was immense, and no matter how they tried to investigate, they couldn't break through.

At the top of the Eight Wastes Mountain, Bai Ze walked out of the grand hall, looked at the black clouds and lightning in the sky, and furrowed his brow.

He then closed his eyes, and soon opened them again, looking at Han Li's residence, with a hint of surprise in his eyes.

"This kid's got some tricks up his sleeve," Bai Ze said with a hint of praise, before turning and walking back into the grand hall.

...

Inside the flower petal space, Han Li was unaware of the heavenly phenomenon he had caused by stimulating the Tongtian Sword Diagram.

He continued to stimulate the sword diagram, but his face had turned pale.

Because at this moment, half of his immortal spiritual energy had been drained.

...

Time passed, and several years had gone by.

Because the various tribes of the Eight Wastes had gathered at a speed that exceeded Bai Ze's expectations, he announced that the Blood Sacrifice Conference would be held earlier than expected.

With the date set, the entire town of Zhenghuang was put on high alert, with the number of guards at the city gates increased several times, and all people were only allowed to exit, not enter.

On this day, at dawn, when the three beats of the drum made from the skin of a Kui beast sounded, the entire town of Zhenghuang began to shake violently, with the city walls emitting a brilliant light, and ancient, barbaric symbols began to appear on the walls.

Han Li and Xiao Bai walked out of the courtyard, just in time to see the brilliant red light rising from the city walls, like giant pillars supporting the sky, before bursting into a dark red glow that enveloped the entire city.

The Blood Sacrifice Conference was finally about to begin!

Han Li looked at the dark red barrier, his brow furrowed slightly, and a flash of divine light appeared in his eyes, as a strand of divine sense separated from his body and flew towards the outside of the city.

However, the moment his divine sense touched the barrier, Han Li's brow transmitted a sharp pain, and his divine sense disappeared in an instant.

After a brief probe, Han Li didn't make any further moves, but a layer of gloom appeared in his heart.
The city's outer boundary was by no means ordinary, and if anything unexpected happened at the Blood Offering Conference, many of his planned escape routes would likely be rendered useless. However, with the Flesh Escape Technique, he had some confidence.

But the cost of using this technique was a bit too high, and if he didn't have to use it, it would be best not to.

"What's wrong? Is something off?" Seeing Han Li's unusual expression, Xiao Bai asked with concern.

"Nothing, don't worry, I'm here." Han Li smiled and rubbed Xiao Bai's head.

Xiao Bai didn't say anything, but slightly lowered his head.

Since learning that he possessed the ink eye Qiong Qi bloodline, he had become somewhat withdrawn, not as lively as before. He was both looking forward to and dreading the Blood Offering Conference.

"Let's go, it's almost time, we should head up the mountain." Han Li called out, leading Xiao Bai to a large square at the foot of the mountain.

Before they arrived, Han Li saw that the square was already packed with people from the Savage Tribes, mainly from the Tian Huo and Ban Shan tribes, with the rest being affiliated tribes. There were nearly ten thousand people in total.

Han Li led Xiao Bai through the crowd and arrived at the front of the square, where he saw Tian Huo tribe leader Liu Qing standing with several hundred tribe members. On the other side, there were also several hundred Ban Shan tribe members.

Like the Tian Huo tribe, the Ban Shan tribe was also one of the sixteen great Savage Tribes, possessing the ancient bloodline of the eight true spirit kings, the mountain giant ape. However, through generations of inheritance, their divine powers had long since diminished, and they had become one of the weaker tribes.

Although they still possessed the ability to move mountains and fill seas, their bloodline had become increasingly diluted, and they had become a marginalized existence.

As for the Ban Shan tribe's appearance, they resembled the Qing Yuan ape, but were much smaller, with dark blue-black fur and a protruding bone on their shoulders. Their eyes had a faint golden glow, giving them an otherworldly appearance.

The leader of the Ban Shan tribe was an elderly ape with a hunched back, wearing a white robe. His face was covered in wrinkles, and his eyes had long white eyebrows, giving him an ancient and frail appearance.

The Tian Huo tribe and the Ban Shan tribe stood on opposite sides of the square, their differences clear.

Han Li and Xiao Bai had not yet approached when Liu Le'er noticed them and smiled, wanting to walk over.

"Today's conference is a grand affair, don't cause any trouble." But before she could move, Liu Qing scolded her in a low voice.

Liu Le'er could only pout and stand still.

Han Li smiled and nodded at her, and with Xiao Bai by his side, he calmly walked to the front of the square.

On the side of the Ban Shan tribe, there was a tribe member who was significantly shorter than the others, with snow-white fur. He was staring at Han Li and Xiao Bai with curiosity.

Xiao Bai was displeased and bared his teeth, trying to intimidate him.

But the tribe member was surprisingly timid and hid behind a taller tribe member.

Xiao Bai found this amusing and relaxed his expression.

The small white ape then peeked out from behind the tribe member and smiled at Han Li.

"Brother Han, although the king has permitted you to attend the conference, today is a rare and grand occasion for the Savage Tribes. There are some things that need to be explained to you." Liu Qing suddenly spoke up.

"Please, elder, I'm listening." Han Li replied.

"A moment later, the heavenly bell will ring on the mountain peak, and the Savage Tribes will ascend the mountain from the eight ancient paths. It's not easy to reach the peak, as the ancient eight kings have set up restrictions that suppress all living beings. Even the strongest Savage beasts may not be able to withstand it, so I advise you to be cautious and not overexert yourself." Liu Qing warned Han Li.

Han Li nodded, "Thank you, elder, I'll remember that."

He then looked at Liu Le'er and Xiao Bai, who were not physically strong. Wouldn't they be at a disadvantage when ascending the mountain?

"Don't worry about them, as long as they possess the ancient bloodline of the eight true spirit kings, they will be fine. The stronger their bloodline, the easier it will be for them to ascend." Liu Qing said.

Han Li felt reassured and put his mind at ease.

He looked up at the towering mountain peak, which was shrouded in a dark red glow. A stone staircase carved into the mountain, a thousand feet wide, stretched up like a giant heavenly ladder.

Just then, three loud bell tolls echoed from the mountain peak.

A series of visible ripples spread out from the peak, as if containing a unique energy. When the ripples reached Han Li, he felt his true spirit bloodline stirring, as if awakened by the energy.

He looked around and saw that the others were also affected, their auras surging as if guided by a mysterious power. A faint pink mist emanated from their bodies.
