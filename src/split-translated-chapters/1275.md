Han Li followed the guidance of the Wailing Soul, speeding forward in pursuit of the fleeing Corpse.

With his current cultivation level in the mid-stage of the Great Luo Realm, he was able to chase after the Corpse for hundreds of millions of miles in the blink of an eye.

Although he was able to lock onto the Corpse's position with his divine sense, the Corpse seemed to be using some unknown method to escape, and every time Han Li closed the distance to within a million miles, the Corpse would suddenly increase its speed and pull away.

The two of them continued to chase each other, unaware of the time passing, until they reached the edge of the Black Wind Sea.

As they gazed out, they saw the fierce winds howling, the black mist swirling, and the dark, shadowy winds connecting the sky and the earth, making it seem like a place that was not to be trifled with.

"No good, it's the Lamenting Wind!" Han Li muttered to himself, his body suddenly radiating a brilliant golden light, and a golden wheel appearing behind him, spinning rapidly as he became shrouded in a misty aura.

However, at this moment, the Corpse also radiated a brilliant golden light, its speed increasing dramatically as it rushed ahead of Han Li, plunging into the dark, shadowy winds and disappearing from sight.

"Ha ha, you want to catch me? Wait another hundred million years..." The Corpse's voice echoed through the air.

Han Li's face darkened, his divine sense expanding rapidly as he probed into the dark, shadowy winds.

But in that instant, the Corpse seemed to have used some unknown divine ability, and it vanished without a trace, leaving Han Li's divine sense unable to detect it.

Han Li's thoughts turned, and he did not rashly pursue the Corpse.

Although the Corpse was a lingering threat, Han Li had just recently advanced to a new realm, and his cultivation was still unstable. To rashly pursue the Corpse would not be a wise decision.

As the saying goes, when faced with two evils, one should choose the lesser of the two. If he could not capture the Corpse this time, he could only wait for another opportunity in the future.

"Master, let me out for a moment." Just then, the Wailing Soul's voice echoed in Han Li's mind.

Han Li nodded, and with a wave of his hand, the Wailing Soul appeared beside him, her eyes shining brightly as she gazed towards the Lamenting Wind.

"Wailing Soul, what have you discovered?" Han Li asked.

"I sensed a familiar aura in these winds, and..." The Wailing Soul said, her hands weaving a spell as a small, dark red cauldron appeared before her, the same one that was the Yan Luo Cauldron.

The Yan Luo Cauldron's surface was radiating a brilliant light, as if it was trying to fly into the Lamenting Wind.

"You should hurry and summon Sun Chongshan!" Han Li seemed to have thought of something, and quickly said.

The Wailing Soul was taken aback, but then nodded and summoned Sun Chongshan.

Sun Chongshan looked around, his eyes widening in surprise as he took in the scene before him.

"How is it that you, fellow Daoist, have come to this place?" Han Li asked, his brow furrowed in curiosity.

Sun Chongshan replied, "The environment here is similar to the place where I obtained the Yan Luo Cauldron in the Tian Shang Realm."

Han Li nodded slowly, his eyes fixed on the Lamenting Wind as he pondered.

"Master, have you been here before?" the Wailing Soul asked.

"I ventured into this area a long time ago, but due to certain considerations, I did not delve too deeply. These winds are called the Lamenting Wind, and they are said to be endless, with a dense, cold aura that is home to creatures like the Yin beasts... There is a legend in the Black Wind Sea that these winds are blown from the You Ming Ghost Realm."

Han Li's eyes sparkled with interest, and he continued, "Perhaps this legend is true."

The Wailing Soul's eyes narrowed, and she seemed to be excited.

"You seem to be very interested in the Lamenting Wind." Han Li said.

"I want to enter and take a look, to see if I can find anything." The Wailing Soul gazed at Han Li, her face taking on a pitiful expression.

"Since the Lamenting Wind seems to have a connection to the Yan Luo Cauldron, I also want to investigate further. However, before that, I need to close my eyes for a period of time, and you should protect me." Han Li said.

"Alright!" The Wailing Soul nodded, and then put Sun Chongshan back into the Yan Luo Cauldron.

Thus, Han Li and the Wailing Soul found a secluded island in the vicinity, set up a temporary cave, and Han Li entered the Flower Branch Space to close his eyes and stabilize his cultivation.

This closed-door meditation lasted for nearly twenty years, but due to the time difference in the space, it was only a short period of time in the outside world.

Before the Lamenting Wind, Han Li and the Wailing Soul stood side by side, while Sun Chongshan was released from the Yan Luo Cauldron.

Sun Chongshan gazed at Han Li, his eyes wide with shock.

He could not imagine how Han Li, who had been unstable and injured just a day ago, could recover so quickly in less than a day.

Could it be that he had consumed some kind of divine medicine that was effective even for Great Luo Realm cultivators?

Although he was puzzled, Sun Chongshan did not ask any questions, and instead waited patiently for Han Li and the Wailing Soul's instructions.

"Let's go, I hope we can catch up to that guy." Han Li said calmly, and then waved his hand, releasing a golden light that enveloped the three of them.

With a whoosh, the three of them transformed into a golden light, flying towards the depths of the Lamenting Wind.

The Lamenting Wind was still filled with a dense, cold aura, and the winds howled fiercely.

However, Han Li's cultivation had increased dramatically since his last visit, and he was able to navigate the winds with ease, quickly reaching a deep area of the Lamenting Wind.

But what disappointed Han Li was that the Corpse seemed to have been swallowed up by the winds, leaving no trace behind, not even the Wailing Soul could sense anything.
Besides this, something unexpected to Han Li was that the yin beasts living inside the Lùo Bǎi Jīng Fēng had not appeared.

Upon arriving at this place, the Yán Lóu Dǐng in Tiě Hún's hand hummed softly, pointing downwards.

Han Li and the others did not hesitate, following the direction of the Yán Lóu Dǐng's guidance as they flew downwards.

Han Li had only attempted to cross the Lùo Bǎi Jīng Fēng region previously, and had not tried to explore downwards. Now, as he descended, he discovered that the seawater below had vanished, replaced by rolling yin winds.

As they flew downwards for a distance, the surrounding yin cold air grew thicker, piercing to the bone, and Han Li's golden light was unable to isolate them.

Sun Chóng Shān's face turned pale, his lips moving as if to say something.

Just then, the yin wind behind him fluctuated slightly, and a black mist-shrouded trident emerged from the yin wind, stabbing fiercely towards Sun Chóng Shān's back.

A metallic clang echoed!

The black trident collided with the golden light surrounding the three, and was immediately repelled.

Han Li saw this and his heart stirred.

This thing, he had encountered it before when he tried to cross the Lùo Bǎi Jīng Fēng region.

At that time, his strength was weak, and he had only managed to repel it, not kill it. He had not expected to encounter it again.

However, this time its strength was far greater than before, at least comparable to that of a Golden Immortal.

Han Li thought to himself, but his actions did not slow down. He raised his hand and pointed.

A golden lightning bolt shot out from his fingertips, striking the black trident.

A loud explosion echoed!

The black trident shattered, and the surrounding Lùo Bǎi Jīng Fēng was torn apart by the scattered lightning. A black humanoid creature emerged.

This creature looked roughly like a human, but its entire body was covered in black scales, and it had a tail behind it, looking like a small demon.

The black demon's face was filled with shock, and it let out a shrill cry as it turned to flee.

Han Li raised his hand, about to strike the black demon, but a black aura had already shot out, enveloping the demon. It was Tiě Hún who had acted.

The black aura reversed its direction, and the black demon was trapped, unable to resist. Tiě Hún swallowed it in one gulp.

Her eyes narrowed, and her body flashed with black light. Her face revealed a hint of intoxication, and it took her a while to recover.

"What a rare delicacy, I haven't tasted such delicious yin soul energy in a long time." Tiě Hún smacked her lips, saying.

"It's just a small demon, is there anything special about it?" Han Li asked.

"This black demon's body contains a small amount of yin soul energy, but its quality is extremely high. Moreover, this yin soul energy is highly compatible with my body, and it will be very beneficial to me." Tiě Hún's face was filled with excitement.

"Is that so?" Han Li said thoughtfully.

"Senior Han, Senior Tiě Hún, the yin cold air here is too thick, I can barely withstand it..." Just then, Sun Chóng Shān interrupted, his face pale and his body trembling.

Han Li looked at him, then turned to Tiě Hún.

"Hmph, you're useless." Tiě Hún frowned, waving her hand to pull him into the Yán Lóu Dǐng.

"Let's continue downwards and see what's there." Han Li looked downwards, his eyes flashing with curiosity.

Thus, the two of them continued their descent, and after a short while, they had been flying for half a day.

This place seemed bottomless, and despite flying for so long, they had yet to reach the bottom.

The yin cold air here was extremely dense, and even Han Li felt slightly uncomfortable.

On the other hand, Tiě Hún seemed to be very comfortable, as if she were enjoying the yin cold air.

The two of them continued their descent, and after a while, the yin wind in front of them began to weaken, as if they were finally reaching the bottom.

Han Li and Tiě Hún's hearts stirred with excitement, and they accelerated their descent.

Just then, the void in front of them began to fluctuate, and a massive blood-red vortex appeared, blocking their path.

A powerful, unmatched devouring force emerged from the blood-red vortex, and the two of them were caught off guard, unable to defend themselves. They were swallowed by the vortex in an instant.

Han Li and Tiě Hún's vision blurred, and when they opened their eyes again, they found themselves in a blood-red space.

Inside the space, there was a massive lake, its waters a deep crimson color, gently rippling.

The lake water looked like blood, but it didn't have any bloody smell, only a faint chill.

Behind the lake, a massive blood-red city stood, extremely majestic, with two large characters written on the city gate: "Ghost Gate".

Han Li and Tiě Hún gazed at the scene, exchanging a glance, and saw a hint of shock in each other's eyes.
