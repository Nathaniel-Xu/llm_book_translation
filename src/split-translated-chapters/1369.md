Facing the purple flame arrow shot towards his heart, Han Li's two fists wrapped in Starlight Force crossed in front of him, attempting to block the arrow.

However, the arrow was like a phantom, directly piercing through his arm and lodging itself in his chest.

But, in the instant the arrow entered his chest, it transformed from a virtual to a real flame, erupting into a fierce purple fire that wildly burned.

A wave of intense heat and pain washed over Han Li, making him feel unbearable, and his entire body was enveloped by the massive shockwave from the arrow, sending him flying backward.

"What's going on...?" Han Li thought in surprise.

This purple flame was too strange, able to transform between reality and illusion, and upon entering his body, it started burning intensely, making him feel as if his entire spiritual energy was being sealed, leaving him struggling to get up from the ground.

"Take advantage of the purple flame sealing his body and kill him immediately!" Zishan shouted.

But there was no need for her to order, as Donglitu had already taken the initiative to leap into the air and charge towards Han Li.

His body was surrounded by a bright yellow glow, and behind him, a virtual image of a Mountain-moving Giant appeared, filled with the dense and rich essence of the Mountain's Law.

The giant's hands were in a holding-the-heavens gesture, and on its palms, the legendary "Tai Mountain" was being held, imbuing Han Li with the true power of a thousand kilograms, striking him with a "Tai Mountain Pressure".

If this blow were to land, even Han Li's physical body would be unable to withstand it.

But just as it was about to hit, a sudden change occurred.

Han Li, who had been struggling to get up, suddenly had a silver flame erupt from his chest, and the Small Flame Bird Phoenix had taken the purple flame arrow for him.

Although the Small Flame Bird Phoenix was a magnificent being, it was still far inferior to the Dao Ancestor, and it had suffered severe injuries from blocking the purple flame arrow. But it still managed to hold on, accompanying Han Li in this act, before returning to his body to recover.

Han Li apologized to the Small Flame Bird Phoenix and slapped the ground, propelling himself upward.

His entire body's True Spiritual Blood Vessels and Heaven's Fury Prison Gates were activated, and a dazzling purple-black glow erupted from his body, as he grew a multitude of purple-black scales, and his body expanded to over a hundred times its original size, transforming into a hundred-meter-tall purple-black giant.

The purple-black giant's head was surrounded by a flashing purple-black glow, and it had twelve heads, each with a different expression, ranging from anger to joy to indifference.

At the same time, the giant's back began to emit a series of "popping" sounds, as twenty-four arms emerged from its back, each with a different hand gesture, from clenched fists to claw-like fingers to fingers pressed together like a sword.

The giant's eyes locked onto its target, and a burst of purple-black energy exploded from its body, surging towards the surroundings and forcing Donglitu to momentarily halt his descent.

"What is this thing...?" Zishan thought in shock, as she followed Donglitu's lead and retreated.

Donglitu had no choice but to accelerate his descent, charging towards Han Li with a crushing force.

Han Li let out a mighty roar, and his twenty-four arms began to move in unison, striking towards the sky, creating a flurry of punches that shook the air, and a series of explosive sounds that echoed through the void.

The space around them was severely distorted, as a massive shockwave erupted, forcing Zishan to retreat.

One punch, a hundred punches, a thousand punches, ten thousand punches...

In the span of a few breaths, Han Li's twenty-four arms moved like a windmill, creating a whirlwind of punches that sent Donglitu flying into the air, unable to fall.

A moment later, a crisp sound echoed through the air.

Donglitu's Mountain-moving Giant image, and the mountain peak condensed from the essence of the Mountain's Law, simultaneously cracked and shattered.

Han Li's fist intent was at an all-time high, as he charged forward, unleashing a flurry of punches that sent Donglitu flying.

The sky and earth seemed to be filled with the sound of Han Li's punches.

Donglitu's body was continuously battered, and his spiritual energy was completely dispersed, his bones shattered, and his body reduced to a mess, like a pile of mud.

Only then did Han Li stop his punches, standing in mid-air.

His twelve heads, each with a different expression, were now unified in their gaze, radiating a fierce and pure killing intent.

"Refreshing..." It was as if a long-suppressed anger had finally been released.

He turned his gaze towards Zishan, who was the only one left.

Zishan's body stiffened, and she involuntarily took a step back.

Her eyes glanced at Donglitu, who had been completely defeated, and she felt a surge of retreat.

But just as she was about to turn around, a strange glint appeared in her eyes, and she gazed past Han Li, towards the mountain range behind him.

Han Li's expression changed, and his massive body turned towards the mountain range.

The mountain range, which had been lush and green, now had a significant portion of its trees withered and yellow, as if someone had absorbed their energy, leaving them dead.

Han Li's spiritual energy swept through the area, but he didn't detect any unusual energy.

"Something's off..."
He suddenly realized why he couldn't sense the old woman's aura, which was suppressed under the mountain range.

……

At this moment, the atmosphere in the Jade Pool became increasingly tense.

Facing the growing threat of the demon and evil clans, the faces of the White Cloud Daozu and others turned slightly pale.

The departure of the Cangwu True Lord and others, the betrayal of Li Yuanjiu and Chi Rong, and the current numerical disadvantage of the Heavenly Court, all made it clear that the situation was unfavorable.

Even many of the cultivators, especially those above the Great Luo Realm, had left, and those who remained were uncertain, their eyes flashing with hesitation, clearly unwilling to truly take action for the Heavenly Court.

"Supreme Lord, the current situation is unfavorable for us, the enemy is well-prepared and comes with ill intent," White Cloud Daozu asked in a transmission.

"No matter," Guo Hen said calmly.

White Cloud Daozu and others saw this and were reassured.

After all, Guo Hen had been able to control the Heavenly Court and govern the entire True Immortal Realm for so many years, which already explained many things.

Since he said it was no matter, it was clear that he had a plan to counter the situation.

"Palace Master is indeed a mastermind, Guo Hen admires him greatly. Without even lifting a finger, he has already dissolved half of the Heavenly Court's strength," Guo Hen said, looking at the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation.

"As the saying goes, 'those who lose the way have few helpers', you should pay the price for your actions," the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation sneered, waving his sleeve.

A long, dark red light beam shot out, several tens of meters thick, and crashed towards the Heavenly Court cultivators like a tidal wave.

Guo Hen pinched his fingers together, and a fine golden light shot out, colliding with the massive dark red light beam.

With a soft "hiss", the massive dark red light beam was extinguished, like ice meeting fire.

The fine golden light also became extremely dim, flickering twice before disappearing.

Seeing the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation take action, the Demon Lord and Bai Ze also immediately ordered their troops to attack, and the demonic and barbarian armies charged towards the Heavenly Court like two massive floods.

"Engage!" Although their strength was currently inferior, White Cloud Daozu and others immediately ordered their troops to engage in battle.

The two sides clashed, and in an instant, the previously calm Jade Pool was filled with flying artifacts, countless colorful lights intersecting, and numerous spiritual domains appearing, overlapping, and colliding.

The sound of the explosion shook the heavens, and the Jade Pool's interior and exterior were instantly shattered, turning into nothingness.

The void mirror-like surface of the Jade Pool shattered, turning into countless space fragments, and the turbulent space currents surged out, but the space fragments and currents were also shattered by the intense collisions.

The surrounding area turned into a gray, desolate void, barely able to withstand the countless intense collisions.

The entire Heavenly Palace continent, from the heavens to the depths of the earth, shook violently.

Fortunately, the Heavenly Palace continent was enormous, and the Heavenly Court had been operating here for countless years, making the continent extremely solid, and it did not shatter.

Those who had left earlier saw this scene and hastily flew further away, leaving the range of the battle's impact, before stopping.

At this moment, the Daozu of both sides also took action.

On the demonic side, apart from the Demon Lord, the remaining four Daozu transformed into four streams of light and charged forward.

On the barbarian side, Bai Ze and the other two also shot out like lightning.

Li Yuanjiu and Chi Rong, however, stood still beside the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation, staring fixedly at Guo Hen, without moving.

"The demonic side will be handled by you, Chen Ruo Yan and Yin Ming Daozu, can you do it?" Guo Hen asked, looking at Chen Ruo Yan and Yin Ming Daozu.

His tone was calm, but carried a hint of sternness.

"I, as one of the Seven Lords of the Heavenly Court, will naturally take action to help the Heavenly Court. However, the enemy is numerous, and the Demon Lord has not yet moved, I fear that we two may not be able to hold out for long. I hope that the Supreme Lord will make a decision soon," Chen Ruo Yan said, her eyes flashing.

"Good," Guo Hen said calmly.

Chen Ruo Yan's eyebrows moved slightly, and she transformed into a blue light, charging towards the four demonic Daozu.

She raised her hand, and a magnificent blue light wheel shot out, spinning rapidly.

With a "plop", the blue light wheel twisted and burst into 81 dragon-shaped blue lights.

These 81 dragon-shaped blue lights were complete with heads and feet, scales, and postures, resembling 81 true dragons, each emitting a terrifying water law fluctuation, and their mouths let out a shocking dragon roar.

The blue light flashed, and the 81 blue dragons intersected, forming a blue array that enveloped the four demonic Daozu.

Yin Ming Daozu's hands vibrated, and countless black shadows appeared around him.

These black shadows seemed neither real nor illusory, and could move according to his will, transforming into various objects in his mind, like the most unpredictable existence in the world.

The countless black shadows shot out, also charging towards the four demonic Daozu.
