Han Li only felt the wind howling in his ears, with waves of tearing force opening from both sides, bringing a gust of wind that made his face ache.

He was squeezed and felt a bit stifled, and subconsciously stretched out his arms, using his elbows to push open the grinding wheel, but he only managed to push back the air a little, and the black and white grinding wheel's physical body continued to squeeze in from both sides.

Tao Ji saw Han Li unable to move for a moment, and his heart couldn't help but relax, with a smile spreading across his face.

Jin Chuan, on the other hand, was unimpressed, and with a smirk, he seemed to be looking down on his old friend for making such a big fuss over a small person.

"Once you enter this yin-yang array, you're on the path of yin-yang, put in some effort, and grind this guy's physical body into powder, leaving only his divine soul. I want to use it to light up a heavenly lamp, to comfort my son's spirit for ten thousand years." Tao Ji shouted loudly.

"Yes!" Behind him, the ninety golden immortal cultivators responded in unison, their voices shaking the air.

Being able to be chosen by Tao Zhanglao to participate in this array, and to receive a reward of ten blocks of immortal stone, was a great opportunity for their future cultivation, and they didn't want to miss it.

They saw that Han Li was not putting up much of a fight, and they thought it was just right, a good opportunity to get a reward without much effort.

If they could get Tao Zhanglao's recognition, their future prospects would be even brighter.

They changed their magic seals, and their immortal energy poured out, stimulating the array to its full power.

The black and white grinding wheel's symbols glowed brightly, and the pressure between them grew stronger, finally pushing Han Li's elbows back, and making a grinding sound that made their teeth ache.

Han Li was in the array, his expression unchanged, and he didn't seem to be in a hurry to counterattack.

He was thinking of using this opportunity to test his physical body's strength, after cultivating in the Accumulated Scales Realm for so long, and to see how strong he had become.

He was adapting to the grinding wheel's pressure, and didn't use much force to resist.

Of course, he still showed a painful expression, and even pretended to be exhausted, and his body was covered in sweat.

In the end, he withdrew his arms, and let the black and white grinding wheel squeeze his body.

"Boom boom boom"

The black and white grinding wheel shook violently, and it seemed like it was about to close in on Han Li.

"Looks like that person was lying, this guy can't hold on for a moment, he's going to turn into powder, Tao Zhanglao should prepare to capture his divine soul, don't let it disperse." Jin Chuan glanced at the array, and said with a smile.

"I didn't expect Yu'er to lose to this kind of person, he must have underestimated his opponent, and was caught off guard, it's all because I wasn't strict enough with him, sigh..." Tao Ji shook his head, and sighed.

"It's not Yu'er's fault, this person was unable to move because of our pre-arranged array, and his immortal energy couldn't be mobilized, and his law's power couldn't be used, so he was at a disadvantage from the start." Jin Chuan waved his hand, and said.

"No matter what, today I can finally avenge Yu'er." Tao Ji nodded, and said with a sense of relief.

Just as they finished speaking, a sudden change occurred!

The black and white grinding wheel suddenly made a strange noise, and when they looked closely, they were shocked to see that the two grinding wheels, which had almost closed in on Han Li, had reopened a gap.

"Is this all you've got? You can't even let me test my physical body's strength?" Han Li's voice came from within, with a mocking tone.

Tao Ji and Jin Chuan's expressions changed, and Tao Ji shouted: "Use all your strength to crush him!"

The other golden immortal cultivators, who had just relaxed, immediately poured all their immortal energy into the array.

The black and white grinding wheel's symbols glowed even brighter, and the pressure between them grew even stronger, but it still couldn't close in on Han Li, and was instead pushed back by him.

Han Li's face was calm and composed, and he didn't seem to be using much force.

Tao Ji saw this, and his expression changed, and he raised his hand, and a golden light appeared in front of him, transforming into a golden flying sword.

The golden flying sword had nine flame symbols engraved on it, and it emitted a wave of heat.

"Fast!"

Tao Ji shouted, and pointed at the sword, and the first flame symbol lit up, and a layer of red flame appeared on the sword, which didn't seem to be burning intensely, but rather like a saw-toothed sword light.

Tao Ji glanced at Han Li, and his hand moved again, and the second flame symbol lit up, and a layer of orange flame appeared on the sword, which surrounded the red flame.

The temperature around them began to rise, and the air was distorted by the heat.

Tao Ji's hand moved again, and the third flame symbol lit up, and another layer of flame appeared on the sword.

The sword was surrounded by layer after layer of flame, and the heat grew stronger and stronger.
Until the seventh emblem lit up, the flying sword was shrouded in seven layers of flames, each layer burning fiercely, making it look like a seven-colored fire fan.

The entire green mountain valley was filled with scorching heat, and the vegetation on the ground had withered and turned yellow under the intense heat. Even the Golden Immortal controlling the formation couldn't bear it, feeling like their blood was about to boil.

"Tao, this person's physical strength is quite impressive, but it's just the last burst of energy from a bowstring. You're using the Seven Fiery Emblems, isn't that a bit too much?" Jing Chuan said, his expression surprised.

Tao Ji didn't respond, but instead pushed his hands forward.

The flying sword, shrouded in seven-colored flames, suddenly shot out, turning into a colorful rainbow, and instantly entered the formation.

Han Li felt the power of the fire element from the flying sword, but his face showed no fear, and he felt a thrill of excitement in his heart.

"This is more like it, just right for testing the depth." Han Li said, his voice low, and he didn't use any techniques, simply unleashing the power of the stars within him, and stood tall, facing the flying sword.

A loud explosion sounded!

The tip of the seven-colored sword was embedded in Han Li's chest, and a wave of intense heat immediately burst out.

Han Li's clothes were instantly incinerated, revealing his chest, which was not overly muscular, but was like steel, resisting the seven-colored sword, and a brilliant white light burst out.

The dazzling light obscured the formation, enveloping Han Li entirely.

A massive wave of flames, like a peacock's feathers, burst out, exploding in all directions, and the intense heat emanating from it shook the entire formation.

The Golden Immortals outside the formation were affected by the power, their bodies swaying, and their figures trembling, almost as if they were being blown away by the flames.

After a while, the flames on the flying sword finally dissipated, and Han Li's figure reappeared.

He was unscathed, except for the torn clothes on his chest, and not a single burn mark was visible.

"This...how is this possible?" Jing Chuan's expression changed, and he exclaimed in shock.

"This person's physical strength is far beyond imagination, Jing Chuan, don't underestimate him." Tao Ji said, his brow furrowed, and he recalled the flying sword.

"Is that all you've got? Is it my turn now?" Han Li said, smiling, as he looked at the two of them.

As soon as he finished speaking, he began to circulate the Heavenly Executioner's Prison technique, his body's acupoints responding with a loud rumbling sound, and his five fingers turned into claws, stabbing into the black and white grinding disks.

Immediately, his body's muscles began to bulge, and a layer of golden fur grew on his skin, and his body expanded to ten times its original size, transforming into a ten-zhang-tall giant ape.

He grasped the two massive grinding disks with his hands, and with a loud roar, he pulled them, causing the entire formation to shake violently, and the light on it began to tremble wildly, losing control, and being pulled into Han Li's hands.

All the people who had set up the formation were affected by the backlash, their bodies shaking violently, and they spat out blood.

"No, quickly retreat..." Tao Ji shouted, alarmed.

But it was too late, Han Li's actions had already triggered the formation's collapse, and the ripples caused by the massive power had trapped everyone, making it impossible for them to escape.

Han Li swung the massive grinding disks with a loud roar, and they came crashing down on the people who had set up the formation.

The Golden Immortals saw that they couldn't avoid it, and their faces filled with terror, they activated their protective treasures, releasing a burst of light, in a desperate attempt to resist.

Two loud explosions sounded, and the light from the treasures burst out, filling the air with the sound of crashing and the smell of blood.

Ninety Golden Immortals had been reduced to a puddle of flesh, not a single one escaping, not even their Nascent Souls.

"You're seeking death!"

A furious roar echoed through the air, and Jing Chuan's figure shot up into the sky, his hands forming a seal, and a blue light shield appeared, covering the entire mountain valley.

"A fire element technique, a water element technique, you two are quite complementary." Han Li said, his expression changing slightly, as he smiled.

As he spoke, his body rapidly shrunk back to its original size.

Jing Chuan didn't dare to hesitate, his hands forming a seal, and a powerful aura burst out, his clothes fluttering wildly, like a fierce wind.
