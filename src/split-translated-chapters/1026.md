It didn't take long for the remaining stone pillars inside the temple to be filled with silver crystals by Han Li.

Han Li swept his gaze around, confirming that everything was in order, and then waved his hand to activate the spell.

The next moment, a burst of silver light erupted from the spell array, and the entire temple began to hum with energy.

At the same time, the Wailing Soul's face lit up with joy, and the black light in its hand dissipated, revealing the divine soul of Dongfang Bai, who was extremely weak.

The divine soul's face was dull and expressionless, as if it had been severely damaged.

"Master, I've checked, this transmission array is connected to four places, one of which is the nearby Golden Han Celestial Palace, one is the Middle Earth Celestial Palace, and the other two..." the Wailing Soul began to say.

But at this moment, a massive silver light pillar erupted from the spell array, shooting up into the sky and illuminating the entire temple in a silver-white light.

Han Li's face changed, and he seemed to have realized something, dashing towards one of the stone pillars to grab the silver crystal.

However, just as he did, the spell array surrounding the temple flashed with a soft glow, and a crystal ball-like light shield appeared, enveloping the entire spell array and the twelve stone pillars.

Han Li's hand was too slow, and he crashed into the light shield, only to be bounced back like hitting a soft wall.

The silver light pillar inside the spell array began to glow, and two figures emerged.

The first person was tall and had fiery red hair, with skin that was also a deep red color. He had long arms and legs, and looked quite strange.

The second person was a young man wearing a golden robe, which Han Li recognized as the attire of a Celestial Inspector.

Han Li looked at the two people, and his face immediately changed, grabbing the Wailing Soul and flying out of the temple.

The person with the fiery red hair was none other than Qi Mozi, the traitorous disciple of the ancient sect that Han Li had encountered before.

Qi Mozi's aura was massive, and he was clearly a powerful cultivator in the Great Luo Realm. The young man in the golden robe, however, had a much lower cultivation level, only at the late stage of the Golden Immortal Realm.

If it were an ordinary Great Luo Realm cultivator, Han Li would have been confident in fighting him, but Qi Mozi cultivated the laws of time, and Han Li had no confidence in defeating him. Moreover, the situation was too unpredictable, and if he got stuck in a stalemate, the consequences would be dire.

Qi Mozi looked at the situation inside the temple, his face filled with surprise, and then immediately looked at Han Li, who was flying out of the temple, his brow furrowed.

But his gaze immediately flashed, and he looked at the young man in the golden robe.

"It's him!" the young man exclaimed, his eyes locking onto Han Li.

Qi Mozi's face lit up with joy, and his body began to glow with a golden light, as if he was about to fly out of the spell array.

But the crystal ball-like light shield surrounding the spell array began to fluctuate, and a powerful restrictive force burst out, freezing the space inside the spell array.

Even Qi Mozi, with his powerful cultivation, was unable to move.

Meanwhile, Han Li had already flown out of the temple with the Wailing Soul, looking back at the two people inside the spell array, especially the young man in the golden robe. He then swung his sleeve, and a burst of golden lightning erupted, enveloping the two people.

A loud crack of thunder sounded, and the two people disappeared from sight.

Qi Mozi snorted, and a golden light flashed on his body, as he took out a golden time candle, which was much larger than Han Li's. The candle's flame was also much more intense, and it seemed to be burning with a fierce energy.

The golden time candle had over 2,000 time law patterns flashing on its surface, emitting a powerful time law fluctuation that seemed to be shaking the surrounding space.

Qi Mozi pointed at the candle, and the flame erupted, releasing a wave of flame-like spiritual energy that enveloped the surrounding area.

The crystal ball-like light shield was immediately affected, its light stopping in place, as if it had been frozen. The spiritual energy inside the shield was also completely still, as if it had been petrified.

Qi Mozi, however, was not affected, and he waved his hand, releasing a golden light that struck the light shield.

The shield shattered, and Qi Mozi disappeared, leaving behind a trail of golden light.

The young man in the golden robe also flew out of the temple, but he was unable to find Han Li or Qi Mozi.

He looked around, his face filled with a mix of emotions, and then sighed, disappearing into a golden light that flew off in a different direction.

Qi Mozi reappeared outside the temple, his body glowing with a golden light, as he released a wave of golden light shadows that flew out in all directions.

His eyes flashed with excitement, and he formed a series of flame-like talismans that flew out of his body, forming a golden spell array around him.

A burst of golden flames erupted from the spell array, enveloping Qi Mozi's body, and his figure began to blur, before disappearing from sight.
More than 100,000 miles away from the Golden Origin Immortal Palace, a mountain peak lit up with a flash of golden lightning, and the figures of Han Li and Ti Huo appeared from within.

"Master, who was that person just now?" Ti Huo asked, her eyes scanning the surroundings, her voice still trembling with fear.

"He is a person from the Heavenly Court's Immortal Prison, perhaps the Prison Master," Han Li replied calmly.

"Prison Master!" Ti Huo's face changed.

"Don't think about that now, this place is not safe, we need to leave immediately," Han Li said, his hands weaving a spell as he spoke.

A loud rumbling sound echoed out, and countless golden lightning arcs shot out from his body, rapidly condensing and changing to form a massive golden lightning array.

At the same time, a flash of golden light appeared in the distance, and a wave of spatial energy emanated from within.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he quickly pointed a finger.

The golden lightning array flared up, and Han Li and Ti Huo's figures blurred and disappeared, leaving behind only the faint remnants of the lightning array.

The golden light expanded, forming a massive golden fire array, and the figure of Qi Mozi appeared, his eyes fixed on the remnants of the lightning array as he let out a cold, mocking smile.

He closed his eyes, sensing the surroundings for a moment, before his hands weaved a spell and the golden fire array flared up.

Qi Mozi's figure disappeared, leaving behind only the faint remnants of the fire array.

In a distant location within the Golden Origin Mountains, a flash of golden lightning illuminated the air, and Han Li and Ti Huo's figures reappeared.

"Master, that Qi Mozi also knows the Spatial Transmission Technique, what should we do now?" Ti Huo asked anxiously.

Han Li's expression was not good, but his hands moved without hesitation, and he quickly cast another spell to form a lightning array.

But before he could activate the array, another flash of golden fire appeared in the distance, moving at an even faster speed than before.

"Quickly!" Han Li shouted, and he activated the lightning array to transmit himself and Ti Huo away.

As soon as they disappeared, Qi Mozi's figure reappeared, and he too activated his Spatial Transmission Technique.

The two of them continued to play a game of cat and mouse, with Han Li using his lightning array to transmit himself and Ti Huo away, while Qi Mozi used his Spatial Transmission Technique to pursue them.

Han Li was in control, but Qi Mozi seemed to be getting closer and closer, and Han Li knew that he couldn't keep this up for much longer.

In a location on the outskirts of the Golden Origin Mountains, a flash of golden lightning illuminated the air, and Han Li and Ti Huo's figures reappeared.

"Why didn't you put me in the Flower Branch Space?" Ti Huo asked, her voice low and serious.

"Because you're a living being, and you need to open the Spatial Door to enter the Flower Branch Space," Han Li replied, his eyes fixed on the surroundings.

"But Master, that person is getting closer and closer, I'm afraid we'll be caught soon," Ti Huo said, her voice trembling with fear.

"His Spatial Transmission Technique combines fire and spatial energy, similar to my lightning array," Han Li said, his eyes narrowing.

"Ah, you want to escape my pursuit? Unless you can transmit yourself over a billion miles away, you won't be able to escape me!" Qi Mozi's voice echoed out, and a flash of golden light illuminated the air.

A massive black whip shot out from the light, tearing through the air and destroying everything in its path.

The whip was incredibly fast, and it struck the lightning array with incredible force, causing it to shatter and disappear.

Han Li's eyes widened in shock, and he quickly grabbed Ti Huo and flew backward, avoiding the whip by a hair's breadth.

The whip continued to pursue them, and Han Li knew that he had to think fast if he wanted to escape.

He flew backward, using his internal energy to fuel his movements, and then punched out with his fist.

A massive golden fist shot out, striking the whip and causing it to shudder.

The whip was incredibly powerful, and it shattered the golden fist, but Han Li was not deterred.

He grabbed Ti Huo and flew backward, using his internal energy to fuel his movements, and then punched out with his fist again.

A massive golden fist shot out, striking the whip and causing it to shudder.

The whip was incredibly powerful, and it shattered the golden fist, but Han Li was not deterred.

He continued to punch out with his fists, each one striking the whip and causing it to shudder.

The whip was incredibly powerful, but Han Li's fists were relentless, and eventually, the whip began to weaken.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the whip disappeared, and Han Li and Ti Huo were left standing, panting heavily.

Han Li's body was exhausted, and he knew that he couldn't keep this up for much longer.

He looked at Ti Huo, and then nodded, making a decision.

"We need to find a way to get you into the Flower Branch Space," he said, his eyes fixed on the surroundings.

Ti Huo nodded, and Han Li knew that he had to think fast if he wanted to escape Qi Mozi's pursuit.

He looked around, his eyes scanning the surroundings, and then he spotted a location in the distance.

"Let's go," he said, and he grabbed Ti Huo's hand, flying off into the distance.
