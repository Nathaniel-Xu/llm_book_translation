Miao Fa Xian Zun's expression suddenly changed, but when she saw the shrinking green light, her eyebrows twitched again, and a hint of uncontrollable surprise flashed in her eyes.

"It's... the Pan Tian Bottle!" she exclaimed in her mind, her body suddenly accelerating as she rushed downwards.

But in the next instant, a golden ring separated from the green light, and thirty time crystals detached from it, turning into a powder that flew into the green light.

The green light suddenly condensed and rapidly expanded, transforming into a small, dark green bottle, which flew into the crystal wall vortex along with the golden ring and disappeared.

"No..." Miao Fa Xian Zun's eyes widened in horror as she watched the treasure her sect had been searching for slip away before her eyes, and she let out a hysterical cry.

Chi Meng also looked on with a gloomy expression, withdrawing the Nine Dragon Divine Fire Shield as he tried to get a closer look at the crystal wall.

But before they could approach, the crystal wall began to fade away, eventually disappearing into thin air, leaving behind only a faint residual energy.

Miao Fa Xian Zun's anger reached its peak as she glared at Chi Meng, her eyes blazing with fury.

If not for this woman's meddling, she would have already returned to her sect with Han Li and the Pan Tian Bottle, achieving the greatest merit in nearly a thousand years. But now, it was all ruined.

"The target is gone, and there's no point in continuing to fight... let's stop this meaningless struggle," Chi Meng said, her brow furrowed in concern.

But before she could finish speaking, a barrage of icy arrows descended upon them, freezing the surrounding environment in an instant.

"Do you think I'm a clay Buddha, to be so easily swayed by your words?" Chi Meng's pride and anger flared up, and she took a step forward, her hands weaving a spell.

The world around them descended into chaos once more.

Lan Yan and Miao Fa Xian Zun's maid, who had been watching from a distance, didn't dare approach, intimidated by the sheer scale of the battle.

"I wonder how Han Li is doing..."

Lan Yan's thoughts were interrupted by a pang of guilt towards the sect, and he could only sigh inwardly.

...

Meanwhile, Han Li's figure appeared on the barren plain.

Below him, a vast river flowed from the horizon, stretching out for thousands of miles without end.

The river was filled with countless water droplets that glowed like tiny orbs, flowing endlessly with the current.

Han Li's anxiety was palpable as he waited, and suddenly, a golden and green light appeared in the distance, hurtling towards him.

The golden light transformed into a ring, which flew onto Han Li's finger, while the green light coalesced into a small, dark green bottle that landed in his hand.

"Kid, what are you doing? With the Pan Tian Bottle, your time-based abilities will be depleted quickly. Hurry up and choose a water droplet to travel through," the bottle spirit warned.

Han Li hesitated, unsure of where to go.

After a moment's thought, he remembered his struggles with the Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue, and how he had been unable to break through despite his efforts.

Since he could travel through the water droplets, why not visit the True Speech Sect again and seek guidance from the venerable Mi Luo?

"Bottle spirit, can you take me back to the True Speech Sect before its destruction?" Han Li asked.

"It's not a problem, but the Pan Tian Bottle will require time-based energy to support it, which means we'll need to consume time crystals," the bottle spirit replied.

"More time crystals?"

Han Li's heart sank at the thought of consuming more time crystals, having already lost thirty earlier.

"The amount of time crystals required depends on the distance we need to travel. The farther back we go, the more time-based energy we'll need. To return to the True Speech Sect before its destruction, we'll need at least twenty time crystals," the bottle spirit explained.

Han Li hesitated, but eventually steeled himself and said, "Let's go."

"Wait..." the bottle spirit said.

As soon as the words left its lips, the golden ring on Han Li's finger flashed, and twenty time crystals detached from it, flying towards the Pan Tian Bottle and merging with it.

The bottle glowed with a soft, green light, and a series of ripples spread out from it.

Before long, a water droplet on the river's surface began to glow, floating towards Han Li.

"This is it," the bottle spirit said.

Han Li's consciousness reached out to the water droplet, trying to glimpse the image within.

But the water droplet suddenly flared with light, emitting a massive, devouring energy that pulled Han Li in with a loud "whoosh."

Han Li felt himself being pulled through space and time, his vision blurring as he lost consciousness.
Han Li's eyes suddenly opened, and he found himself standing in a simple room.

The room was not large, with two small windows and simple furnishings. A wooden desk and chair were placed by the window, with a teapot and cup on top. The other half of the room had three beds, with the bedding neatly arranged.

On the wall opposite the beds hung a large banner with a portrait of a monk with large ears, which was none other than Miro Old Ancestor.

Han Li looked around and saw that this was likely a room shared by several disciples of the True Speech Sect. There was no apparent danger, and he breathed a sigh of relief.

A faint golden ring floated above his head, covered in dense time dao patterns. There were over 1,600 groups of patterns. The Heavenly Vessel was suspended in the center of the ring, but its spirit was nowhere to be seen. Perhaps due to the influence of the golden ring, the Heavenly Vessel appeared blurry.

Han Li's eyes narrowed as he took in the scene, and he quickly pushed open the door and walked out.

Outside was a small courtyard, similar to many others in the area. There were hundreds of such courtyards, built on the side of a massive white mountain peak. The courtyards were surrounded by white jade palaces that stretched as far as the eye could see, with more palaces floating in mid-air.

Han Li was familiar with this place, having visited once before when his divine sense had traversed the area. This was the True Speech Sect's main sect, but the last time he had visited, the Heaven's Court was attacking the sect, and the area was filled with smoke and destruction. Now, however, it was clean and tidy, with a majestic atmosphere.

In the air, True Speech Sect disciples in white robes flew by, looking prosperous and thriving.

Han Li quickly formed a seal, and his body flashed with spiritual light as he transformed into nothingness to avoid being seen.

He paused for a moment, then dispersed his divine sense to explore the surroundings.

A moment later, Han Li's face lit up with joy, and he flew towards the peak of the white mountain, using the Infinite Void Silent Technique to conceal his presence.

After a few breaths, he landed in front of a two-story pavilion on the mountain peak. Next to the pavilion stood a black stone stele with the words "Cang Gong Pavilion" inscribed on it.

The area was quiet and deserted, with only an old man with white hair sitting in meditation in front of the pavilion. He was the guardian of the pavilion.

The old man's cultivation was not ordinary, having reached the middle stage of the Taiyi realm.

Han Li landed silently, and the old man seemed to sense something, suddenly opening his eyes and looking around in confusion.

However, Han Li's Infinite Void Silent Technique was too profound, and his concealment technique was also a mysterious art that he had learned earlier, combined with the mysteries of the "Law of Heaven and Earth". As a result, although they were close, the old man could not sense Han Li's presence.

Han Li smiled slightly, formed a seal, and shot out several crystal chains from his fingertips, aiming at the old man's head.

The chains left Han Li's body and immediately became visible.

The old man's face changed, and he was about to jump up, but the chains were too fast, and they entered his forehead before he could react.

The old man's movements froze, and he remained in a half-standing, half-sitting position.

Han Li quickly subdued the old man, carefully sensing the surroundings, and found no signs of trouble. He breathed a sigh of relief and took the white token from the old man's hand.

With a slight sense of the token's power, he walked to the pavilion and formed a seal to activate the token. A white light shot out, entering the pavilion's door.

The door immediately emitted a layer of white, crystal-like light, with countless symbols and talismans flashing on its surface.

Han Li formed another seal, and another white light shot out, entering the light screen. The symbols and talismans on the screen quickly disappeared, and the light screen itself vanished. The pavilion's door creaked open.

Han Li smiled, about to enter the pavilion, but suddenly stopped and turned to the old man. He formed a seal, and five thin black lights shot out from his fingertips, entering the old man's body.

The old man's expression relaxed, and he regained some of his normal movements, sitting down in a meditative position.

This was a puppet technique that Han Li had learned from the Crab Taoist during his time in the Accumulated Scales Realm. Although it was not as powerful as true puppetry, it was sufficient to control the old man's divine sense and prevent him from revealing any secrets.

With that done, Han Li entered the pavilion, closing the door behind him. The door's light screen flashed again, re-sealing the entrance.
