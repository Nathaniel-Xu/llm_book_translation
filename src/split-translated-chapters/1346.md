"What's wrong with your expression, is there something wrong with this immortal realm?" Jin Tong looked at Han Li and asked in confusion.

"Nothing. If you want to close your eyes, it's not very safe in any immortal realm, so let's go to the outside realm instead." Han Li shook his head and didn't say anything more.

He waved his hand and sent a golden light enveloping the two of them, shooting them towards the sky. They quickly passed through the Tian Feng Realm and the Qing Ming Realm, arriving at the outside space.

Han Li didn't stop, flying towards the depths of the outside space for a long time before stopping.

He expanded his divine sense, quickly finding a safe place, and opened a cave on a massive meteorite, setting up a restriction.

All of this Han Li had already mastered, and he quickly finished, then opened the Flower Branch Space, and he and Jin Tong entered it.

"Husband, just now outside, the aura was fluctuating strongly, are you alright?" Nangong Wan saw Han Li appear and asked with concern.

She immediately saw Jin Tong behind him, her beautiful eyes sparkling, and a warm smile appeared on her face.

"You must be Jin Tong, right? Back when you hadn't transformed, we had met in the lower realm, who would have thought that you would become such a beautiful person?"

As she spoke, Nangong Wan stepped forward and grasped Jin Tong's hand.

"Master..." Jin Tong seemed a bit uncomfortable with Nangong Wan's familiarity, and his expression was a bit stiff.

"Don't call me Master, husband may be your master, but that doesn't concern me, and my cultivation is far below yours, so this title is unnecessary, just call me by my name." Nangong Wan smiled.

"Master Nangong." Jin Tong had already called Han Li "fellow Daoist", and hearing this, he didn't make any excuses, and directly changed his title, bowing.

Nangong Wan smiled and returned the bow.

"Husband, what happened just now outside?" Nangong Wan asked Han Li after greeting Jin Tong.

"It was just a bit of a conflict with someone, we fought twice, don't worry about it." Han Li waved his hand, speaking casually.

Jin Tong heard this and rolled his eyes.

It was indeed just two battles, but the opponents were a Primordial Dao Ancestor and Gu Huo, the strongest person in the world.

These two big shots in Han Li's words seemed to be somewhat insignificant.

Not long ago, they had been desperately trying to avoid Gu Huo's pursuit, almost falling.

Of course, she knew that Han Li was trying not to worry Nangong Wan.

"That's good." Nangong Wan's eyes flashed with a hint of surprise, seeming to see something, but she didn't ask any more questions.

"Wan'er, we've found a place to close our eyes, and we'll be cultivating for a while..." Han Li told Nangong Wan about his plans.

"Perfect, I also want to see your mysterious space." Nangong Wan's eyes lit up, smiling.

Han Li saw this and immediately set up a formation, opening the Spirit Domain, and covering the Flower Branch Space. Then he activated the Light and Shadow Heavenly Array and the True Words Treasure Wheel.

The flow of time in the Flower Branch Space suddenly changed, speeding up by tens of millions of times.

Compared to before, his time law power had improved even more, and the time acceleration had become even faster.

"This is incredible! Time law is indeed one of the three supreme laws, today I've seen it!" Nangong Wan looked around, her face filled with wonder.

"This isn't something that ordinary time law can achieve... To sum it up, I've mastered time law, and in the entire True Immortal Realm, I'm not afraid to say that I'm second, and even the first one may not be able to match me." Han Li chuckled, joking with Nangong Wan for the first time in a long time.

Jin Tong saw Han Li, who was usually serious, joking around, and his face revealed a hint of surprise.

"You're not serious, you're not afraid of being laughed at." Nangong Wan glanced at Han Li.

"Han fellow Daoist, Nangong fellow Daoist, you can talk slowly, I'll go find a place to close my eyes." Jin Tong quickly bid farewell, flying towards the depths of the Flower Branch Space.

Han Li laughed, waving his hand, and brought Nangong Wan into the pavilion.

"Husband, is your closed eyes cultivation very important?" Nangong Wan asked.

"I must put in my full effort." Han Li nodded seriously.

"You focus on cultivating, don't worry about me." Nangong Wan smiled.

Han Li nodded, taking out a storage artifact and handing it to Nangong Wan.

"Wan'er, I don't know how long my closed eyes cultivation will take, there are some medicinal pills, immortal stones, and other cultivation resources inside, you can use this time to cultivate."

Nangong Wan didn't decline, taking the storage artifact, knowing that this was the only way to truly put her mind at ease.

After reminding Han Li not to be too impatient, she quickly left the pavilion.

Han Li watched Nangong Wan leave, then stood up, setting up a formation in the pavilion that required the Splitting Corpse Technique. The Earthly Corpse was also taken out and placed inside the formation.

Next, he carefully set up layers of restrictions around the pavilion, preventing his power from erupting and causing unnecessary shockwaves when he made his breakthrough.

After finishing all of this, he sat down, closed his eyes, and calmed his mind.

...

In front of the unnamed palace in the Heavenly Court.

Gu Huo sat in a wheelchair, holding a brownish-yellow orb.

The orb's surface had a faint yellow glow flowing around it, and it was clear that it was no ordinary object, emitting a powerful earth law.

Looking at the orb, he had a hint of a smile on his face.

However, his joyful expression quickly froze, and he closed his eyes, seeming to sense something.
Here is the translated text:

A moment later, Gu Huo Jin opened his eyes, his eyebrows furrowed.

"In such a short time, they've vanished without a trace. Perhaps I shouldn't have been so cautious earlier, after all, we've reached the final step. It's not necessary to be so concerned..." Gu Huo Jin muttered to himself.

...

Inside the Flower Branch Space.

After three days and three nights of meditation and adjustment, Han Li's body and mind were in their best state.

He stood up and checked the arrangements once again, then closed his eyes and entered the spiritual realm.

"Ah, you've finally found time to visit me." Another Han Li, dressed in the same blue robes, looked at him calmly and smiled.

This person had the same aura as Han Li, without the ferocity of the evil corpse or the benevolence of the good corpse. His expression was calm and peaceful.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed slightly, sensing that this time the difficulty of severing the corpse would be much greater than before.

He walked up to the blue-robed Han Li and sat down cross-legged.

"Have you come to sever me?" the blue-robed Han Li asked with a faint smile, as if discussing something unrelated to himself.

As he spoke, he pointed a finger, and a stone table appeared between them, with two cups of clear tea on it.

"That's right," Han Li replied, picking up a cup and taking a sip.

"Ah, then do you understand what a self-corpses is and how to sever it?" the blue-robed Han Li asked, not showing any anger.

Han Li fell silent.

In fact, he knew very little about severing self-corpses, and his understanding of what a self-corpses was was not as clear as his understanding of evil corpses or good corpses.

Earlier, he had tried to obtain some information about self-corpses through the Wheel of Reincarnation mask, but the results were minimal. Most of the information was vague and did not involve the actual process of severing.

After all, severing a self-corpses was the final step in the Great Luo realm's three corpses, and only those who had reached the Dao Ancestor realm or were peak Great Luo realm cultivators could understand the process.

Such people, even if they had recorded their experiences and methods, would not easily pass them down to others.

"A self-corpses is oneself, and to sever it, one must sever one's own self," the blue-robed Han Li said, seeming to see through Han Li's thoughts.

"You're actually telling me this, which is quite unexpected," Han Li said, his eyes flashing.

"This is something you'll naturally understand when you reach that step, and there's no need to hide it. Besides, even if you know this, it's still extremely difficult to sever me," the blue-robed Han Li said with a smile.

"You're quite confident," Han Li said, his eyes narrowing.

"Then I'll ask you, are you willing to kill your own companions to sever me? For example, the Gold Child outside?" the blue-robed Han Li asked.

"Why would I need to kill my friends to sever a self-corpses?" Han Li asked, his eyebrows furrowed.

"Or kill your own wife?" the blue-robed Han Li asked, ignoring Han Li's question.

Han Li's face darkened, and he didn't respond.

"Or kill your own parents?" the blue-robed Han Li continued.

"I think it's better to kill you," Han Li suddenly said, his fist flying towards the blue-robed Han Li.

A giant golden fist, the size of a mountain, appeared in front of the blue-robed Han Li, striking down fiercely.

The blue-robed Han Li shook his head and sighed, his sleeve fluttering as he extended a white hand, his fingers shining with golden light.

With a loud crash, the hand grasped the golden fist, stopping it from moving.

Han Li saw this and immediately struck out with his other hand.

At the same time, golden light erupted from his body, and the Time Domain appeared, covering the blue-robed Han Li.

The blue-robed Han Li's body also shone with golden light, and a Time Domain appeared around him.

Han Li's other fist struck the blue-robed Han Li's domain, but it was like hitting a stone wall, with no effect.

The two domains clashed, their power evenly matched, and they remained locked in a stalemate.

"You and I have the same cultivation and divine abilities, so why waste our energy? To sever me, you should first understand what a self-corpses is," the blue-robed Han Li said with a faint smile.

Han Li ignored the blue-robed Han Li's words and pointed a finger.

Dozens of lightning sword lights shot out, changing and transforming into thousands of golden lights and countless lightning bolts, striking towards the blue-robed Han Li.

The blue-robed Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and he made a hand seal, summoning hundreds of golden lightning sword lights to counterattack.

The two of them clashed in the spiritual realm, their power evenly matched, as the blue-robed Han Li had said.

In the blink of an eye, ten days passed.

The two of them were exhausted, gasping for breath, and unable to continue fighting, so they stopped.

Han Li let out a low hum, his body disappearing from the spiritual realm.

His consciousness returned to his physical body, his spirit feeling extremely fatigued.

The struggle with the self-corpses in the spiritual realm was mostly a contest of spiritual energy, which put a huge burden on the spirit.

Han Li's face changed, and he finally let out a sigh, closing his eyes once again.
