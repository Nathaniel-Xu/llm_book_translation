He walked away?

Just as Gan Jiu Zhen stood still, gazing at the distant horizon, a figure suddenly appeared beside him, and it was the Master of the Wheel of Rebirth.

However, the Master's body seemed somewhat hazy and transparent, and it was clear that it was a projected clone.

Gan Jiu Zhen merely nodded silently, seemingly un surprised by the Master's appearance.

"What do you think of him now?" the Master asked.

"He gives me a very frightening feeling, completely different from before. Even 'as deep as the ocean' can't describe it. This feeling, I've only experienced it from you, how could his power increase so greatly?" Gan Jiu Zhen asked, his eyes fixed on the Master.

"If I'm not mistaken, he has already cut off the Good Corpse, and his power is now comparable to mine." The Master smiled.

"Really? That means he's already broken through from the middle stage of the Great Luo Realm to the late stage in such a short time?" Gan Jiu Zhen's expression changed suddenly.

"How he did it, I don't care. But you must remember, the Supreme Law is called Supreme because it's closer to the origin of the Heavenly Way. Especially after cutting off the 'Evil Self' and 'Good Self', the Supreme Law can now make the self and the Heavenly Way merge, its power is now on a completely different level. The Wheel of Rebirth Law is the same, as is the Time Law." The Master said slowly.

"I've only heard that the Supreme Law is special, but now I finally understand. It seems I must hurry up too." Gan Jiu Zhen took a deep breath, clenched his fists.

"There's gain and loss, cultivating the Supreme Law is even more difficult, especially for those who enter the Great Luo Realm, it's a journey of constant fear. This True Immortal Realm is vast, there are countless geniuses and heroes who want to comprehend the Supreme Law, but what's the result? You mustn't let your heart be moved, you have your own path." The Master saw through Gan Jiu Zhen's thoughts and said directly.

"Yes." Gan Jiu Zhen replied awkwardly.

"If you have the heart, from today on, you can go to the mortal world to travel." The Master said.

"Go to the mortal world to travel?" Gan Jiu Zhen was taken aback.

"How can one cut off the Good Corpse if one doesn't understand what's good? Most cultivators have lost their initial good intentions, and are even inferior to ordinary mortals. Only by understanding what's good can one proceed." The Master said with a hint of profundity.

Gan Jiu Zhen heard the Master's words, and seemed to have a revelation, but for a moment, he didn't understand the meaning behind the words, and stood there silently.

"The unintentional good can bring blessings to the soul in the Wheel of Rebirth, even if I can control the Six Paths of Rebirth, it's not easy to change the fate of those who have done great good..." The Master seemed to be muttering to himself, and continued.

"Yes, I understand. Father, are you really going to keep the appointment?" Gan Jiu Zhen asked, his eyes filled with thought.

"The war between us and the Heavenly Court is inevitable, your mother has been taken by the Heavenly Court, Jiu Zhen, you can't get into trouble again." The Master looked at Gan Jiu Zhen, his voice softening slightly.

"I want to go with you to rescue Mother." Gan Jiu Zhen said.

"No, you must stay here and not take a step out!" The Master's voice was stern.

Gan Jiu Zhen had never seen the Master's expression so severe before, and his heart was shaken, but his eyes still held a determined glint.

"Only if you're safe and sound can I focus on dealing with the Heavenly Court, your mother's matter, I'll leave it to Han Li and me." The Master sighed, patted Gan Jiu Zhen's shoulder, and then disappeared.

Gan Jiu Zhen looked at the empty space in front of him, opened his mouth, and stood there for a long time before turning to fly towards the depths of the palace.

...

Dragon Abyss Immortal Realm, Tian Hai Continent, Wudragon City.

The Dragon Abyss Immortal Realm was abundant with water, and more than 80% of the realm was a vast ocean, with only 20% being land. The land was scattered with islands, each one unique.

The Tian Hai Continent was the largest landmass in the Dragon Abyss Immortal Realm, and Wudragon City was the largest city on the continent.

Wudragon City was built on the coast, its geographical location extremely advantageous, situated at the intersection of several continents. The city was bustling with activity, and its fame was known throughout the Dragon Abyss Immortal Realm.

However, even more famous was the Wudragon Sect outside the city.

The Wudragon Sect was an extremely ancient sect in the Dragon Abyss Immortal Realm, its founding unknown. It had always been the top sect in the realm.

Later, the sect's genius cultivator, Feng Qing Shui, rose to prominence, and eventually broke through to the Dao Ancestor Realm, causing the Wudragon Sect's reputation to shake the True Immortal Realm.

Now, the Wudragon Sect was at the height of its power, its strength unmatched, and its influence spreading throughout the realm.

In the center of Wudragon City was a massive square, over a hundred li in size, with teams of blue-robed guards patrolling the area.

These people were the Wudragon Sect's outer disciples, responsible for maintaining the city's stability.

Not only Wudragon City, but the entire Tian Hai Continent was under the Wudragon Sect's jurisdiction, and the Dragon Abyss Immortal Realm's Immortal Palace could hardly intervene.

In the center of the square stood a massive blue stone gate, towering into the clouds, like a giant blue peak.
The grand archway was covered in countless array patterns, resembling a spider's web that completely enveloped the massive structure. The array patterns extended from the archway, radiating downwards and spreading across the square below.

The square was filled with a dense array of transmission arrays, ranging from large to small, with over a thousand in total. Each transmission array was connected to the archway via array patterns, and they all flashed with a bright light at the same time.

These transmission arrays connected the True Immortal Realm to the various large domains, with countless people traveling through them every day.

A transmission array flashed with white light, and six figures appeared within it, stepping out into the square.

Among the five, they chatted and laughed, seemingly close friends, while a single blue-robed man stood slightly apart from the others.

"Wow, this is indeed the Fog Dragon City, it's majestic! The spiritual energy here is so rich, far surpassing our Tianheng Domain." A blue-clothed girl among the five took a deep breath, exclaiming in admiration.

"That's to be expected, the Dragon Abyss Domain is one of the 36 major domains, naturally surpassing our Tianheng Domain. It's worth us five siblings betting our entire fortune to obtain the transmission talisman to come here." A black-robed elder said.

His cultivation had reached the Golden Immortal realm, making him the strongest among the five. The others clearly regarded him as their leader.

The other four nodded in agreement, their faces filled with joy.

"Of course, we must also thank Brother Han, otherwise we wouldn't have been able to afford the transmission fee." The black-robed elder smiled, looking at the blue-robed man beside him.

"Ho, Brother Han, you're being too polite, it's just a mutually beneficial arrangement. The transmission array can transmit six people at a time, and you five were willing to accept me as a companion, saving me a significant amount of spirit stones." The blue-robed man smiled.

The black-robed elder nodded in response, "Brother Han, you're being too polite."

"Now that we've arrived, we'll have to work hard to establish ourselves here. Our spirit stones are almost depleted, and the difficult days are ahead of us. Let's strive to make a name for ourselves in this place." He turned to the other four, saying.

"Yes," the others replied in unison.

"Brother Han, you're a loose cultivator, why not join us and work together? It's better to have more people to rely on." The black-robed elder turned to the blue-robed man, saying.

"I have other matters to attend to, so I won't be joining you. I wish you all the best in your cultivation." The blue-robed man smiled, bowing his head.

The black-robed elder's face showed a hint of disappointment, but he didn't say anything, instead nodding slightly and leading the other four towards the city.

The blue-robed man, however, didn't leave immediately, instead gazing around him.

"Hey, cultivator, this transmission square isn't your home, you can't just stand around, hurry up and leave!" A nearby guard, a tall and thin man, saw the blue-robed man standing still and assumed he was awestruck by the city's scenery. He sneered, saying.

The blue-robed man seemed to ignore him, standing still.

The guard's face darkened, and he took a step forward, intending to chase the blue-robed man away and teach him a lesson.

But as he approached the blue-robed man, his footsteps slowed, and his face showed a strange expression.

The blue-robed man stood still, doing nothing, but as the guard drew closer, his spiritual sense began to tremble uncontrollably, and the closer he got, the more intense the trembling became.

This blue-robed man was none other than Han Li, who had returned to the Black Wind Sea Domain from the Abyssal Realm and hurried to the Dragon Abyss Domain.

He had expanded his spiritual sense, probing the situation around him.

The Dragon Abyss Domain was vast, far surpassing the Crane Peak Domain, and even Han Li's current spiritual sense couldn't fully encompass it. He could only probe a small portion of the domain.

However, he was able to cover the entire Tianhai Continent with his spiritual sense, and the situation within the Fog Dragon Sect was clear to him. But his brow furrowed slightly.

He couldn't sense the auras of either Nangong Wan or Feng Qingyu.

Nangong Wan was someone he was familiar with, but Feng Qingyu, as a Dao Ancestor, shouldn't be able to evade his current spiritual sense, which had reached the seventh layer of the Refining the Soul technique.

"Could it be that Jiuzhen's information was inaccurate?" Han Li wondered, his eyes narrowing as he turned to the guard.

The guard's eyes immediately became hazy, and a multitude of memories flashed before his eyes, revealing his entire life's experiences in a rapid, dazzling display.

With his experience traveling through the True Immortal Realm and witnessing countless cultures and people, Han Li's control over the Refining the Soul technique had become more refined, allowing him to probe the memories of a Taiyi realm cultivator with ease.

Han Li quickly probed the guard's memories, gaining a basic understanding of the Fog Dragon Sect's situation. He vanished into thin air, leaving the guard behind.

The guard's eyes cleared, and he looked around, feeling as though something was missing from his mind.

He scratched his head, muttering to himself, and continued to patrol the square.
