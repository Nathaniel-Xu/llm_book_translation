After speaking, Qí Mó Zǐ's hands formed a seal, and the time law power within his body surged out, transforming into a golden large hand that grasped towards the altar. The golden flames on the altar were sucked into his hand.

"This is indeed a good thing..." Qí Mó Zǐ felt the time law power contained within the golden flames, and his heart was filled with joy. He clasped his hands together, and the flames were absorbed into his body.

Once the golden flames left the altar, the already damaged altar finally collapsed, and a large, dark hole appeared on the ground. A surge of demonic energy emerged from the hole, and dozens of grotesque demons with different shapes and forms rushed out, their mouths letting out strange howls.

Among them was a demon with a height of over ten zhang, with a pair of large, curved horns on its head, and a face resembling a goat. Its body was similar to that of a human, with two white, fleshy wings on its back. However, its arms were blood-red, with sharp bones protruding from its skin.

The demon's gaze fell upon Qí Mó Zǐ and his companion, and it seemed to sense the powerful aura emanating from Qí Mó Zǐ. A hint of hesitation appeared in its eyes, but the anger and bloodlust that had been suppressed for too long quickly took over.

"You have all been suppressed for too long, so let these two be your first blood offering as you regain your freedom. Tear them apart!" The demon's voice was hoarse and unpleasant, causing Xíng Shān to frown and rub his ears.

The demons let out a chorus of howls and charged towards Qí Mó Zǐ and his companion. Qí Mó Zǐ's eyebrows furrowed slightly, and he raised his hand, releasing a wave of golden flames that transformed into a golden light screen.

The demons that were charging at the front collided with the light screen, and a series of pained cries echoed through the air. The demons seemed to have their life force drained away, and their bodies quickly withered and turned to ash.

The remaining demons were shocked and retreated in disarray. The demon with the blood-red arms, enraged, stretched out its hand, and a massive, blood-red palm emerged, covering the sky.

The demon's palm grew to several thousand zhang in size, casting a dark shadow over the ground. The air was filled with a bloody, murderous aura, and the demons that were within the palm's range felt their auras surge, momentarily forgetting their fear as they charged towards Qí Mó Zǐ and his companion once more.

Xíng Shān, standing behind Qí Mó Zǐ, felt his heart racing, and his mind was filled with terrifying images. A faint, murderous aura began to grow within his heart.

"Protect your spiritual sea!" Qí Mó Zǐ shouted, and Xíng Shān was jolted awake. He quickly formed a seal, withdrawing his spiritual energy and guarding his spiritual sea.

Qí Mó Zǐ reminded him, then turned his attention to the demon, taking a step forward and raising his hand to strike. A surge of golden light erupted from his palm, colliding with the demon's palm and producing a deafening crash.

The demon stumbled back, its palm shrinking back to its normal size. "Blood Hand, I am not your enemy. Do not attack again, or I will be forced to kill all of you," Qí Mó Zǐ warned, his eyebrows furrowed.

"You know me? Who are you?" The demon's expression changed, and a hint of fear appeared in its eyes.

Qí Mó Zǐ did not respond, instead tossing an object at the demon. The demon caught it, and upon examining it, discovered that it was a white, bone-like token with a grotesque, demonic pattern etched onto it.

"This is Second Brother's bone token..." The demon's eyes narrowed, and it spoke in a low tone.

"He and Copper Lion have already escaped, and I have come to rescue you," Qí Mó Zǐ said.

"You still haven't answered my question, who are you?" the demon asked, its brow furrowed.

"Intelligent people don't ask so many questions. They're waiting for you..." Qí Mó Zǐ sneered, then summoned Xíng Shān, and the two of them disappeared into the distance.

The demon looked at the token in its hand, its gaze sinking into thought. After a moment, it let out a roar, and the demons followed it as it flew towards the distance.

Once the area was quiet, a figure emerged from the distance - Wén Zhòng. He looked at the ruined temple and the destroyed altar, his face twisted in anger as he cursed. He then began to repair the altar.

...

Hán Lǐ left the Fire Temple and continued to fly upwards.
Han Li flew for a while before slowing down, as he saw that Qi Mozi and the others were not chasing after him. He then took out the white, spherical bead.

The bead's surface flames had completely disappeared, and only a faint white glow remained. There was no sign of the intense flames that had been present earlier.

Han Li saw this and was not surprised, but instead felt a sense of joy.

Ordinary divine artifacts, even when not activated, would still have spiritual energy fluctuations and law energy spreading out.

This white bead's behavior was due to its internalization of all its flames and law energy. Unless it was activated, it would not reveal its power.

The higher the quality of the artifact, the greater its power.

Han Li thought that among the many divine artifacts he possessed, only the Polaris Bottle and the Golden Disk had reached this level.

Han Li calmed his mind, took a deep breath, and spat out a mouthful of cyan energy that merged with the white bead. At the same time, he formed a series of hand seals that flew towards the bead.

A soft "whoosh" sound was heard.

The white bead emitted a burst of white flames that rolled and jumped, accompanied by a terrifying high temperature that made the surrounding air tremble. The flames also revealed a powerful, unmatched law energy that spread out.

In an instant, the white mist within a radius of several dozen li was completely evaporated, leaving no trace.

Han Li had already prepared himself before activating the bead, and his body was surrounded by a strong golden light. The law energy of time immediately enveloped his body, isolating the flame energy outside.

Without the interference of the flame energy, the bead's terrifying high temperature could no longer harm Han Li. He secretly activated the "Tian Xia Town Prison" technique, using it to resist the intense heat.

At this moment, a clear, crisp cry was heard, followed by a flash of silver light. The Blazing Fire Bird flew out of Han Li's sleeve and landed on his shoulder.

The bird's eyes were fixed on the white bead, revealing a greedy, human-like gaze.

As soon as the Blazing Fire Bird appeared, it absorbed most of the intense heat energy.

Han Li relaxed, his hand seals moving faster as he established a connection with the white bead. The flames on the bead grew stronger.

"Quickly!" Han Li thought, his hand seals guiding the bead.

The white bead's flames burst forth, shooting out a long, white flame that wrapped around a nearby, towering peak.

The peak was about 200-300 meters tall and 30-50 meters in diameter, with a thick, ancient copper color and a rich, golden aura.

The Seventh Layer of the Years Tower was incredibly dense with heavenly energy, and after many years of nourishment, the ordinary trees and vegetation on this peak had become top-grade spiritual materials. Some of the mountain rocks had also become top-grade minerals.

This peak had transformed into a massive, golden mineral, resembling a Xuan Copper Stone.

Although the quality of this mineral was not sufficient to forge a divine artifact, it was renowned for its durability and hardness, making it suitable for constructing strongholds and secret rooms that could last for tens of thousands of years.

The white flame touched the ancient copper peak, silently and effortlessly cutting through it. The peak's upper half broke off, crashing down towards the ground, and the sound of the impact was like thunder.

The peak's surface was smooth, as if it had been cut by a divine sword.

Han Li saw this and felt a mix of emotions, a sense of joy and then a sigh.

The white bead's power was beyond his expectations.

However, his cultivation technique was not fire-attribute, and he had not practiced any fire-attribute secret techniques. Activating the white bead was extremely difficult, and he could not fully unleash its power.

The Blazing Fire Bird let out a series of high-pitched cries, conveying its desire for the white bead.

"Don't worry, my cultivation technique is not fire-attribute, and I'm unable to fully utilize the bead's power. The white bead will definitely be yours, but be cautious when using it, as its power is immense." Han Li glanced at the Blazing Fire Bird and formed a hand seal.

The white bead trembled, then flew towards the Blazing Fire Bird.

The bird was overjoyed, spitting out a silver flame that enveloped the bead, and then swallowed it whole.

As the bead entered the bird's body, its flames surged, and aside from the silver flames, a kaleidoscope of colors appeared, revealing the power of the Seven-Color Fire Dan Sand.

The Blazing Fire Bird had the ability to absorb and refine various flames, but it had not yet fully refined the Seven-Color Fire Dan Sand.

The seven to eight types of flames intertwined and clashed within the bird's body, emitting a series of muffled, thunderous sounds. The bird's body began to distort, with bulges forming, as if it was about to burst.

Han Li's expression changed, and he quickly stopped the escaping light, covering the Blazing Fire Bird with a golden glow. He then released his divine sense to examine the bird's condition.
