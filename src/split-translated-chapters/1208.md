The old man in the grey robe and the young woman in the red dress were the same two people that Han Li had met in the Five Elements Thunder Domain earlier. Their names were supposed to be Sun Chongshan and Miao Xianzi.

However, on that day, Sun Chongshan had abandoned Miao Xianzi and another black-armored man to escape on his own, and they should have borne a grudge against each other. Han Li wondered how they had ended up together again.

The white-robed nun's appearance and figure were similar to those of Yu Menghan, a human woman Han Li had met in the Ling Huan realm, and he couldn't help but stare at her for a moment.

However, it had been a long time since they had last met, and they were now separated by two realms. Han Li couldn't confirm her identity at the moment.

The white-robed nun seemed to have noticed Han Li's gaze and turned her head away, her eyebrows furrowed.

"Big cabin ticket?" Han Li asked, his expression immediately returning to normal.

"The guest rooms on the Day and Night Divine Vessel are divided into three types: big, medium, and small. The big cabin ticket costs three thousand spirit stones, the medium one costs two thousand, and the small one costs one thousand. If we five people buy a big cabin ticket together, although it will be a bit crowded, we can save a lot of spirit stones. What do you think, friend?" the old man in the grey robe asked with a smile.

Han Li looked at the middle-aged cultivator from the Day and Night Alliance, who was standing quietly to the side and didn't seem to be objecting to the old man's suggestion.

"Sorry, I'm used to living alone. Thank you for the offer, friend," Han Li said, shaking his head.

The old man's face fell, but he didn't try to persuade Han Li further. He nodded slightly and led the other three people away.

Han Li glanced at the four of them and then bought a small cabin ticket from the middle-aged cultivator.

With only one day left, Han Li didn't have the time to go out and explore. He found a place to sit in the hall, closed his eyes, and began to meditate.

Earlier, he had used up a lot of his energy in the big Luo battle with Chi Meng, and he needed to recover. This was a good opportunity to do so.

As he sat there, Han Li secretly cultivated his energy and kept an eye on the four people, especially the white-robed nun.

The nun looked very similar to Yu Menghan, and her aura was also similar. Could it be that she was really Yu Menghan?

However, when Han Li had left the Ling Huan realm, Yu Menghan's cultivation had not even reached the Nascent Soul stage, and her talent was not particularly good. How could she have cultivated to the Golden Core stage in such a short time?

Although Liu Le'er's cultivation had also progressed rapidly, and she was now close to the big Luo stage, she had the bloodline of the Nine-Tailed Fox and the support of the Tianhu clan's cultivation resources. It was a different story.

The white-robed nun seemed to be a lone cultivator, and she was careful with her spirit stones. She probably wasn't Yu Menghan, but just someone who looked similar.

The old man in the grey robe and the others continued to chat with the cultivators who came in, trying to find someone to share a cabin with.

As the departure time approached, more and more people came in, but most of them had already bought their tickets and were just gathering.

The old man in the grey robe and the others asked seven or eight people, and finally found someone willing to share a cabin with them. It was a middle-aged man with triangular eyes and a fierce expression, and his cultivation had reached the Golden Core stage.

However, his clothes were a bit tattered, and his skin was rough. He looked like a lone cultivator.

After finding the fifth person, the old man in the grey robe and the others sat down and waited for the Day and Night Divine Vessel to depart.

Before long, half a day had passed.

The room was now full of people, and it was time to depart.

"Everyone, please follow me," the two cultivators from the Day and Night Alliance said, walking towards the back of the hall.

The crowd stood up and followed them.

At the back of the hall, there was a door, and behind it was a corridor. After walking through the corridor, they came to a large square.

In the center of the square was a huge flying boat, over three hundred feet high and seven or eight hundred feet long. The hull was rounded, like a giant egg.

The flying boat was a deep blue color, with intricate blue and white symbols etched into its surface. The symbols formed a complex pattern of arrays, which looked very mysterious.

"This is the Day and Night Divine Vessel. It's indeed extraordinary," Han Li said, looking at the arrays on the flying boat. They were all star arrays, and they seemed to be even more complex than the ones in the Ji Lin realm.

Below the flying boat was an entrance, and Han Li followed the others inside.

The interior of the Day and Night Divine Vessel was divided into ten layers, each with many rooms of different sizes. The space was utilized to the fullest.

Han Li found his room according to the ticket, and it was very small, only a few feet long and wide. There was only a bed and a small chair, and it was very simple.

However, Han Li was not someone who cared about material comforts. He closed the door and sat down on the bed, then released his divine sense to explore the surroundings.

The walls of the room had arrays that isolated it from the other rooms. However, these arrays were not enough to block Han Li's divine sense.

"Ah!" he exclaimed.

It turned out that the old man in the grey robe and the others were staying in the room next to his.

Their room was bigger than Han Li's, but it was still very simple. There was only a bed and a small table.

"Let's make do with the space," the old man in the grey robe said with a smile.

Han Li's eyes narrowed slightly as he watched the group through the arrays.
The white-robed nun and the mysterious girl saw that the space was so narrow, and their eyebrows were slightly furrowed.

"There's only one bed, let Yu Xianzi and Miao Xianzi take a seat, and we three men will just find a place to rest." The black-clothed youth glanced at the white-robed nun and said.

"Yu Xianzi!" Han Li heard the black-clothed youth's words, and his heart moved slightly.

But before the black-clothed youth finished speaking, the triangular-eyed middle-aged man had already taken a big step forward, sat down on the bed, and lay down.

"You..." The black-clothed youth's face sank.

"This bed is in the room, and whoever gets here first gets to sit on it. Hehe, you want to use it to please the girls, that's your business, I don't have the time for that." The triangular-eyed man chuckled, then stretched and lay down on the bed.

The black-clothed youth was furious, and in his family, he was respected and had never been treated like this before. He clenched his fists, ready to explode.

The triangular-eyed man turned his head and looked at the black-clothed youth, his triangular eyes staring at him, and a cold, snake-like glint flashed in his eyes.

The black-clothed youth shivered, and his anger was suddenly extinguished, disappearing without a trace. He stood there, stunned.

"Everyone is on the same boat, and we're all in the same room, so we should value harmony. Since Lin Daoyou is tired, let him rest well, and we can sit on the floor and meditate." The gray-robed old man intervened.

The black-clothed youth snorted, took the opportunity to back down, and sat down in a corner of the room.

The triangular-eyed man burst out laughing, but didn't care about the others and closed his eyes.

The black-clothed youth's eyes flashed with a hint of deep-seated resentment, but it quickly disappeared.

The gray-robed old man, the white-robed nun, and the red-dressed young woman all sat down, and the room quickly became quiet.

...

Han Li withdrew his probing consciousness, and a faint smile appeared on his lips.

The people next door were quite interesting, and it was likely that something interesting would happen along the way.

He quickly put aside his thoughts, made a gesture, and a series of cyan lights fell on the room, opening up multiple layers of prohibition light curtains, enveloping the room tightly, and only then did he stop.

At this moment, the Dayu Divine Boat shook and rose into the air.

Han Li looked out of the room through a small window and saw that the Dayu Divine Boat was quickly rising into the sky, and the Golden City below was rapidly becoming smaller. The Dayu Divine Boat trembled slightly, then turned into a blue light and flew towards the Jiuyuan City at an incredible speed.

The Golden City quickly disappeared from view, and the Dayu Divine Boat's speed was unimaginable.

Han Li saw this scene and was both surprised and delighted.

The Dayu Divine Boat's flight speed was not slower than his own flight speed, and at this speed, he could definitely reach Jiuyuan City within 30 years.

He quickly withdrew his gaze, raised his hand, and a few golden lights flew out, transforming into four or five golden Dao soldiers, guarding the room.

He then waved his hand again, opening the entrance to the Flower Branch Space, and stepped inside.

"Master, have you already set off towards Jiuyuan City?" Qiuhun saw Han Li enter and approached him.

Xiaobai was currently practicing in the distance and didn't come over.

Han Li nodded, briefly explaining the situation of boarding the Dayu Divine Boat.

"I found out from Creek Tang's divine soul memory that Master, you should take the Dayu Divine Boat to Jiuyuan City." Qiuhun said.

"Huh, where are Qu Lian and Lanyan?" Han Li's brow suddenly furrowed, and his gaze swept around.

He couldn't sense the auras of Qu Lian and Lanyan.

"Qu Lian was just snooping around the Flower Branch Space with ill intentions, so I took advantage of the situation and used a secret technique to put him to sleep. As for Lanyan, although she has a request for us, she's been quite obedient, but people's hearts are hard to fathom, so I also put her to sleep to be safe." Qiuhun pointed to the attic in the distance and said.

Han Li's consciousness probed, and Qu Lian and Lanyan were both in the attic, unconscious, and he nodded in approval.

"It's good that you're cautious."

He had come in to use the time difference space to continue his closed-door cultivation, and Qu Lian and Lanyan would have caused some trouble. Even if Qiuhun hadn't taken action, he would have found a way to seal their divine senses.

As he thought, Han Li raised his hand, and a series of golden lights flew out, falling on the attic where Qu Lian and Lanyan were, opening up multiple layers of prohibition, and only then did he feel at ease.

He then came to the Light Shadow Heavenly Array, which had been damaged, and the entire array was dark and not functioning.

Last time, to escape from the Ling Domain, Han Li had no choice but to destroy a corner of the Light Shadow Heavenly Array.

Fortunately, the Light Shadow Heavenly Array was set up by him, and the materials were still available, so repairing it wasn't difficult.

Han Li flipped his hand, and a small pile of materials appeared on the ground, and he began to repair the array.
