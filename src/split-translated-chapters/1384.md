Guo Huo Jin finished speaking to himself, and suddenly remembered the half- divination he had Chen Pao perform for himself earlier. A faint shadow of doubt flickered across his mind.

"You are indeed the greatest variable today, and this time I will stop at nothing to eliminate you! No one can stand in the way of my great plan!" Guo Huo Jin's voice boomed out.

As soon as he finished speaking, his body began to glow with spiral symbols, and the chaotic vortex behind him began to expand rapidly. A massive gray light ball separated from the vortex and shot towards Han Li at incredible speed.

Han Li had been anticipating this, and his eyes flickered slightly as he raised his hands. The two hands he had clasped together suddenly separated, and his palms shot out in front of him.

He felt a gentle breeze brush past his ears, but then countless golden lights appeared out of thin air, surging towards the massive gray light ball.

The golden lights converged, forming a clear outline of a river of time. The originally calm waters suddenly surged, becoming a raging torrent that crashed into the gray light ball.

The two colors clashed, creating a massive shockwave.

The gray light ball absorbed the golden lights around it, growing larger and larger, but its speed slowed down.

When it had grown to tens of thousands of meters in size, it almost came to a standstill.

But then, a loud thunderclap boomed out!

The massive chaotic light ball suddenly split in two, and then exploded in a burst of light.

"Boom boom boom..."

The continuous explosions shook the air, causing the space around them to expand rapidly. All the heavenly energy and dust in the air were reduced to nothingness.

In an instant, the shockwave began to contract, leaving behind a black hole that sucked in the surrounding matter and energy.

Guo Huo Jin watched the scene before him, his brow furrowed in concern.

He saw a river of time appear in front of him, tens of thousands of miles away, and Han Li's figure walking on it, as if he had crossed over a hundred years with each step.

Guo Huo Jin looked at the tall young man with five time law artifacts surrounding him, and was about to speak when Han Li suddenly punched him.

Han Li's fist shot out, and the five time law artifacts flew out of his body, merging into the river of time below.

The surging river of time transformed into a massive golden fist, surrounded by blazing golden flames, and charged towards Guo Huo Jin.

Without traversing space, without any obstruction, this massive fist imbued with the true intent of the five elements and time law struck Guo Huo Jin.

"Boom!"

The golden fist exploded, releasing a blast of energy that destroyed the two massive arms extending from the chaotic vortex.

The Demon Lord and the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth felt the pressure ease, and retreated tens of thousands of miles away.

As they looked back at Han Li, they saw the turbulent flow of time law surrounding him, making the space around him seem distorted.

"He's using time law so recklessly, isn't he afraid of being assimilated by the heavens?" the Demon Lord asked with a furrowed brow.

The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth simply shook his head, remaining silent.

After a moment, the golden light dissipated, and the five time law artifacts returned to Han Li's body.

He gazed at Guo Huo Jin, his brow furrowed in concern.

As the light faded, Guo Huo Jin's figure reappeared, his body unscathed, his aura even stronger.

"The chaotic law can devour all things, and I have already reached the state of invincibility. You can use all your time law power, it's all meaningless to me, haha..." Guo Huo Jin laughed, his eyes gleaming with excitement.

Han Li was about to speak when he felt a sudden pain in his chest.

He looked down to see the small green bottle on his chest glowing with a red light.

"Kid, what are you waiting for? Now that you've reached the position of the Dao Ancestor, you have the qualifications to try and refine the Heavenly Vessel Bottle. Don't hesitate, try it now." A familiar voice echoed in his mind.

"Bottle Spirit, what do you mean by refining the Heavenly Vessel Bottle?" Han Li asked hesitantly.
"Boy, do you know why the Heaven-Sealing Bottle is called 'Heaven-Sealing'? This object was born alongside the rise of the Heavenly Dao, and it is the first mysterious object in the world, containing not only the laws of the Heavenly Dao, but also the remnants of the Primordial Chaos. Now, Gu or Jin has absorbed the laws of the Primordial Chaos, trying to advance to the level of the Primordial Chaos Ancestor, and reopen the heavens and the earth. If you don't refine this bottle, what other chance do you have?" The bottle spirit's voice was urgent and slightly angry.

"Why did you only tell me this now, Senior?" Han Li asked.

"You're always asking so many questions! I, the bottle spirit, was born when the previous you, the Master of the Cycle Hall, infused all his time laws into the bottle. I'm just a humble spirit residing in this small bottle. Throughout the endless ages, I've been striving to cultivate and understand the true secrets of the Heaven-Sealing Bottle." The bottle spirit spoke rapidly.

"So, when I often called out to you, Senior, but received no response, it was because you were also cultivating?" Han Li asked in surprise.

"That's right. This time, Gu or Jin has disrupted the Heavenly Dao, trying to make the world return to the Primordial Chaos, and reopen the heavens and the earth. The small bottle was born alongside the creation of the world, and it has a connection to this. Now, let's stop talking and refine the Heaven-Sealing Bottle quickly. I'll assist you with all my might." The bottle spirit urged once more.

Just as Han Li was about to speak, a thunderous roar shook the sky, and a massive gray cloud condensed above him. A chaotic lightning pillar, wrapped in dark purple electricity, descended from the sky and struck Han Li.

Without needing his conscious control, the 72 Sword Spirit Children flew out and formed a massive sword array in the air, unleashing countless divine lightning bolts to counter the chaotic lightning pillar.

A deafening boom shook the air!

The two lightning bolts exploded simultaneously, creating a massive storm that swept across the land, covering an area of hundreds of millions of miles. The surrounding void was torn apart, revealing massive rifts. The entire Middle Earth Immortal Realm was almost completely destroyed.

The sword array formed by the Qingtian Bee Cloud Sword also collapsed under the massive impact, dispersing and reforming into the Sword Spirit Children, who flew back to Han Li's side.

"Stone friend, Master, please help me guard against this attack. I have a plan that might give us a chance to survive in this situation." Han Li transmitted his voice.

The Demon Master hesitated for a moment, but the Master of the Cycle Hall immediately responded, "If you don't have a plan to stop Gu or Jin, then trust him." The Master of the Cycle Hall flew towards Han Li first.

The Demon Master followed, his brow furrowed in concern.

The two of them stood on either side of Han Li, like two guardian deities.

Han Li sat in the void, his hands clasped together, holding the Heaven-Sealing Bottle. A moment later, his clasped hands glowed with a brilliant red light, which seemed to penetrate his body, illuminating his meridians and bones.

The Master of the Cycle Hall and the Demon Master both sensed this and turned to look at Han Li, their hearts filled with surprise.

The Heaven-Sealing Bottle had been controlled by the Master of the Cycle Hall for a long time, and he had used it to face countless battles. However, he had never felt such an aura emanating from the small bottle.

"Han Li, I will not let you become a variable!" Gu or Jin discovered the anomaly and shouted.

Without waiting for his words to finish, he formed a seal with his hands and struck Han Li.

The next instant, the Primordial Chaos vortex shook violently, and a massive white light pillar erupted from the center, expanding into a massive sea of light that engulfed Han Li and the others.

The light pillar destroyed everything in its path, leaving only the void and the remnants of its power.

"It's over... we've reached the end..."

The Master of the Cycle Hall muttered to himself, then raised his hand, and the six Wheels of Rebirth flew out, forming a massive barrier in front of them.

The Wheels of Rebirth expanded rapidly, growing to tens of thousands of feet in size, and radiating a dark red glow.

A deafening boom shook the air!

The massive Wheels of Rebirth shook violently, their surfaces flashing with light as they rotated rapidly in the void.

The powerful force of the light pillar was blocked by the Wheels of Rebirth, but the remaining light pierced through the void, destroying the entire Middle Earth Immortal Realm.

Han Li remained oblivious to the chaos around him.

At this moment, he was fully focused on operating the Great Five Elements Fantasy Sutra, condensing his time laws into countless threads of light that connected with the small bottle in his hand. His mind had fully entered the space within the bottle.

The small bottle seemed to contain an infinite realm, and Han Li felt like a tiny speck of dust, insignificant and tiny.

Han Li looked around, seeing only darkness and various colored light clusters, some as large as star clouds, others as small as campfires. Each cluster radiated different law fluctuations.
