"Master, your mind is unsettled, what has happened?" Ti Hu (Crying Ghost) opened her eyes and asked.

"Ti Hu, take a look at the six people in that private room, and try to find out their identities and purpose for coming here," Han Li transmitted his voice.

Ti Hu didn't understand Han Li's intentions, but nodded and focused her attention on the private room.

At that moment, the door to the private room opened, and a Daoist nun in a green robe with blue eyebrows walked in.

This Daoist nun was a Da Luo realm cultivator, looking rather young, with rosy cheeks and an aura of fragrance, as if she were a plant spirit transformed into human form.

"Stone friend, please, I am the Chief Elder of the Day Moon Pavilion, you may call me He Hua Xian Niang (Lotus Flower Immortal Maiden)," the Daoist nun glanced at the Thunder Stones beside her, her eyes flashing with light, but quickly withdrew her gaze and smiled at Han Li.

"He Hua Xian Niang, no need to be polite, can the Day Moon Pavilion afford these Thunder Stones?" Han Li asked indifferently.

"Stone friend, you're joking, even if there were a thousand, or ten thousand Thunder Stones, the Day Moon Pavilion could still afford them," He Hua Xian Niang replied with a smile.

"The Day Moon Pavilion indeed has deep roots, then please, He Hua Xian Niang, estimate the price," Han Li raised an eyebrow and smiled.

He Hua Xian Niang glanced at the Thunder Stones and quickly withdrew her gaze.

"These Thunder Stones are of exceptional quality, and the quantity is not small, let's say each Thunder Stone is worth one hundred and fifty million spirit stones, you have thirteen, that's a total of one thousand nine hundred and fifty million spirit stones, let's round it up to two million spirit stones, how's that?" He Hua Xian Niang asked with a smile.

Han Li had already inquired about the price of the Thunder Stones, and had thought that selling them for one thousand five hundred million would be a good deal, but now he was selling them for two million spirit stones, so he naturally had no objections.

"He Hua Xian Niang, you're a straightforward businesswoman, I have some other materials to sell," Han Li waved his hand, and took out a pile of materials, which were the leftover items from cleaning up the Flower Branch Space.

He had put these items up for sale in the Reincarnation Hall, but over the years, not many had been sold, so he might as well get rid of them all at once.

"These things are quite miscellaneous, but there are a few decent items among them, let's say I'll take them all, four hundred million spirit stones, how's that?" He Hua Xian Niang glanced at the items and asked.

Han Li didn't haggle, and nodded.

Perhaps he was losing a bit, but it was better to get rid of them all at once and avoid any further trouble.

After the transaction, Han Li gained two million four hundred million spirit stones, almost recovering the amount he had spent earlier, and his mood was greatly improved.

He Hua Xian Niang finished the transaction and didn't linger, quickly leaving with the blue-browed attendant.

"Master," as soon as He Hua Xian Niang left, Ti Hu spoke up.

"What did you discover?" Han Li asked through transmission.

"Those people haven't spoken in a while, and I didn't gather any information, but I've figured out the identity of one of the six people, you know him too," Ti Hu replied.

"Who is it?" Han Li asked.

"It's the Blue Color we met at the Sui Yue Xian Fu," Ti Hu responded.

"Blue Color? Are you sure?" Han Li was startled and asked.

"I'm certain, I was only paying attention to the bidder's spiritual aura earlier, and didn't notice the others, but now I've taken a closer look, and one of them is definitely Blue Color," Ti Hu's expression was firm.

Han Li knew that Ti Hu's perception of spiritual auras was extremely keen, and wouldn't be mistaken, so he nodded slowly.

Blue Color was from the Jiu Yuan Guan, and the other five people were likely also from the Jiu Yuan Guan, but what were they doing here?

"Continue to monitor their movements, and report back to me if you discover anything," Han Li instructed Ti Hu.

"Don't worry, Master, their private room's restrictions can't block my perception," Ti Hu guaranteed.

Han Li left the matter to Ti Hu, and continued to watch the auction below.

Time flew by quickly, and the auction had already gone through several rounds.

"The next item is a Tai Yi peak Three-Legged Golden Crow Beast Core, containing boundless fire energy, suitable for refining magical tools, or cultivating the fire energy within, the starting price is three hundred million spirit stones, each bid must be at least ten million," the fat old man announced the next item, a golden-red beast core the size of a bowl, radiating a dazzling light.

Han Li's eyes lit up, this was the item he had been looking for to help the Jing Yan Tong Zi recover.

This Three-Legged Golden Crow Beast Core was a rare treasure, but compared to other items, it was somewhat inferior, and the VIPs didn't seem interested, so Han Li raised the price slightly, and bought it for five hundred million spirit stones, putting it into the Flower Branch Space.

The Jing Yan Tong Zi's body flashed with flames, transforming into a flame bird, and swallowed the beast core, letting out a few happy cries before flying into the depths of the Flower Branch Space to refine it.

At this moment, the auction stage presented the next item, a long, black jade box, covered in seals, with a strong, cold, ghostly energy emanating from it.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he sat up straight, while Ti Hu beside him looked surprised, gazing at the jade box.

The fat old man mumbled some words, broke the seals, and opened the box, revealing a black, short flute, made from a piece of leg bone, with a skull at one end, looking extremely eerie.

A powerful, cold, ghostly energy burst out, with a mournful, wailing sound, like a saw cutting through the mind, making it hard to bear.

Han Li's eyes locked onto the flute, and he sat up straight, his expression solemn.
The obese old man hastily waved his sleeve, and a burst of white light erupted from the auction stage, forming a white light screen that enveloped the black short flute. The crowd below finally felt a slight relief.

"Next, we have the Scattered Soul Ghost Flute, also a treasure of the Ghost Path, personally crafted by the ancestor of the Wan Gui Sect, Niuli Shangren, in the Realm of the Dead Sea. Although it was damaged in the battle of the Dead Sea and fell to a fifth-grade treasure, its power still surpasses that of ordinary fifth-grade treasures. You've all seen its power, and its main effect is to attack the soul. It's not suitable for demonstration, so let's begin the bidding. The starting price is one million yuan stones, and each bid must be at least fifty thousand yuan stones higher."

The obese old man introduced the black short flute and announced the start of the bidding.

Han Li's heart initially felt a surge of joy, but then his brow furrowed.

This black short flute was the second treasure that Ti Hu had valued, and the jade slip had only mentioned that it was an artifact that attacked the soul. He had not expected it to be so renowned, and it was previously a fourth-grade treasure.

With this in mind, the price of this treasure would likely be much higher than that of the Ghostly Claw. Although Han Li had around four million yuan stones, he might not be able to afford it.

As Han Li pondered, the bidding had already begun, and the price had risen to two million yuan stones after several rounds.

"Two million five hundred thousand!" Han Li's thoughts turned rapidly, and he raised his hand to bid, increasing the price by five hundred thousand yuan stones.

He had limited yuan stones, so he could only try to intimidate the other bidders.

Indeed, Han Li's bid caused the entire hall to fall silent, with many people looking shocked and unwilling to bid further.

"Two million eight hundred thousand!" A cold voice suddenly spoke up, and it was the person who had competed with Han Li for the Ghostly Claw.

Han Li's brow furrowed slightly, and he was about to bid again.

"Three million!" Another cold and arrogant voice spoke up from a different VIP box.

Han Li looked over and saw a young man in a blue shirt, with an extraordinary demeanor.

"Three million three hundred thousand!" Han Li raised his hand to bid.

"Three million four hundred thousand!" The young man in the blue shirt frowned slightly, looked at Han Li's box, and spoke in a low tone.

"Three million six hundred thousand!" The cold voice spoke up again, with a determined tone.

The young man in the blue shirt's body trembled, and he stopped bidding.

"Four million!" Han Li declared firmly.

The crowd erupted into a commotion, with everyone looking at Han Li's box and whispering among themselves about his identity and wealth.

Han Li ignored the crowd and glanced at the box where the young man in the blue shirt was sitting.

The box was silent for a moment, and Han Li's heart slowly calmed down.

"Four million five hundred thousand!" However, just as he was about to relax, the cold voice spoke up again.

Han Li let out a long sigh and smiled wryly, turning to Ti Hu and saying:

"Ti Hu, it seems that the other party has more wealth than me, and we won't be able to get the Scattered Soul Ghost Flute."

But to his surprise, Ti Hu's eyes were closed, and he seemed to be ignoring Han Li's words.

Han Li found this strange but didn't disturb him.

At this point, no one else bid, and the obese old man asked three times before declaring the Scattered Soul Ghost Flute sold.

Just as he did, Ti Hu opened his eyes, revealing a look of surprise and excitement.

"Master, I just overheard a conversation between those people, and I obtained some important information."

"What information?" Han Li was about to tell Ti Hu that the Scattered Soul Ghost Flute had been sold, but he stopped and asked instead.

"I'm not sure I can repeat it clearly, Master. You should see for yourself."

Ti Hu pinched his fingers together, and a thread of black light entered Han Li's brow.

Han Li's mind flashed with a black light, which then burst open, revealing a scene from the VIP box.

"Senior Jin's wealth is truly impressive, able to spend such a large amount of yuan stones so easily." A black-clad person spoke with admiration.

"A mere trifle, nothing to be concerned about." A tall, thin figure spoke with a sense of pride.

"Enough, we've bought the necessary items. We've already wasted too much time. Let's focus on the main task and capture the Devouring Gold Immortal. If we let him escape again, we'll all be in trouble." A petite, cold-voiced woman spoke up, but her voice was somewhat indistinct.

"Yes, yes..." The others seemed to fear her and hastily agreed.

The scene was brief, and it disappeared after a few moments.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and a strange glint appeared in his eyes.

The people from the Jiu Yuan Pavilion were trying to capture the Devouring Gold Immortal. Could it be that Jin Tong had escaped from the Jiu Yuan Pavilion?
