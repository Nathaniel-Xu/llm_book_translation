"This is something I should be asking you! This is already the realm of the Underworld, don't think that just because you've washed away the Yang energy from your bodies with the Three Lives Water, I won't recognize you as true cultivators of the True Immortal Realm! Where did you come from, hurry back to where you came from, the Underworld doesn't welcome you!" The middle-aged man in black robes said coldly.

"Ah, I see, we two are just passing by, sir, you're probably the guardian of this place, the Underworld's Ghost Messenger?" Han Li's heart stirred upon hearing this, but his expression didn't change, and he smiled.

"It looks like you're not planning to leave, in that case, you'll die here, deploy... Ten Directions Piercing Heart!" The middle-aged man in black robes' face turned cold, and he drew out the war spear from his back, pointing it forward.

As soon as his voice fell, the ghostly army behind him instantly split into two groups, forming two triangular formations, the ghostly army's auras connected together, becoming one entity, indistinguishable from one another.

The two triangular formations transformed into two large, black arrow shadows, shooting towards Han Li and Ti Xuan, their speed was unimaginable, and in the blink of an eye, they arrived in front of the two, bringing with them a massive wave of ghostly energy and wind pressure, the air in front of them was almost shattered.

Ti Xuan was caught off guard, and her body stumbled, before being blown away.

Han Li's body, however, remained still, and he was secretly shocked by the ferocity of the ghostly army's formation, his aura instantly skyrocketed, and a dazzling golden light burst forth from his hand, a golden lightning sword appeared in his hand.

In a series of sharp, piercing sounds, hundreds of golden sword energies shot out, instantly gathering in front of him, forming a rotating golden light pillar, blocking the two large, black arrow shadows.

"Boom!" A massive shockwave erupted, transforming into countless powerful gusts of wind that swept towards the surroundings.

The two formations stopped, then rebounded, the formations within flashed with black light, and ghostly energy surged, but they didn't collapse.

Han Li was also blown back two steps, before stabilizing his body.

At this moment, the air behind him stirred, and a black spear shadow suddenly appeared, stabbing towards his back like a venomous snake.

A golden lightning flash, and another golden lightning sword appeared behind Han Li, as if it had been waiting there all along, blocking the spear shadow.

Again, a "Boom" sound erupted, and two powerful light rings, one black and one gold, suddenly appeared in the underground space, before exploding.

The black spear shadow was repelled, and the middle-aged man in black robes appeared, his face filled with surprise.

Han Li's body was also blown back, flying away, but he swept his sleeve, and a golden light shot out, transforming into a golden girl, who was Jintong.

"You and Ti Xuan go take care of those two formations!" Han Li shouted to Jintong.

Before his voice fell, his body suddenly jumped, and he shot towards the middle-aged man in black robes.

The two golden lightning swords also shot towards the middle-aged man in black robes, arriving in front of him in an instant, before expanding to over a hundred times their original size, resembling a pair of gigantic golden scissors, cutting down.

The middle-aged man in black robes' black war spear expanded, rapidly rotating, before stabbing out, accurately striking the intersection of the two golden swords.

"Boom" A crisp sound echoed, and the two golden swords stopped in mid-air, the middle-aged man in black robes also flew back.

Han Li saw this, and his hands formed a seal, drawing in energy.

The two giant swords suddenly lit up, and two large, golden lightning bolts shot out, the middle-aged man in black robes didn't even have time to react, before being struck.

A dazzling, golden light ball appeared, enveloping the surroundings, and shattering all the ghostly energy and cold air, leaving not a single trace behind, only the intense, golden lightning arcs flashed, crackling with energy.

But at this moment, a black light appeared, and the surrounding golden lightning arcs were absorbed into it, like a whale swallowing water.

The middle-aged man in black robes appeared, his body spotless, without a single hair out of place, his right sleeve cuff flashed with black light, emitting a suction force, which was the source of the black light.

In an instant, all the golden lightning was absorbed into his sleeve.

Han Li saw this, and his eyebrows furrowed.

The Heavenly Thunder didn't just have incredible destructive power, but its pure Yang energy also had a natural suppressive effect on ghostly powers, yet it was easily absorbed.

He thought for a moment, but his attack didn't stop, his hand formed a seal, and the two golden swords trembled, hundreds of golden sword shadows appeared, like clouds and fog, enveloping the middle-aged man in black robes.

The middle-aged man in black robes' war spear shook, and the spearhead rapidly vibrated, conjuring countless black, icy stars, which shot towards the golden sword shadows.

The sound of clashing metal echoed through the air.

At this moment, Ti Xuan and Jintong were also fighting against the two ghostly armies.

Jintong transformed into a Golden Devouring Immortal, and was fighting against one of the formations, her battle intent seemed low, but she relied on her indestructible body to tie down the formation, not allowing it to escape, and didn't launch a full-scale attack.

On the other side, Ti Xuan was flashing around within another formation, she looked extremely excited, and her hand grasped at the air.

The sky suddenly darkened, and a massive, black claw appeared, emitting a boundless, black energy, before exploding downwards, striking one of the triangular formations, which was the Underworld's Ghost Claw.
A surge of overwhelming power came crashing down, freezing the air within a radius of several dozen miles, turning it into steel, and causing the entire battle array to come to a standstill.

But in the next instant, the battle array surged with a fierce black light, tearing apart the surrounding power.

"Turn!" a ghostly creature in the Taiyi realm shouted from within the battle array.

This person held a large black flag, and as they waved it, a series of black lights shot out from the flag, merging with the black light surrounding the battle array.

The conical battle array immediately lengthened, transforming into a black dragon shape, constricting the falling black claws and suspending them in mid-air.

Tixi saw this scene and didn't mind, even revealing a faint smile, and suddenly opened his mouth to spit out a black light.

A black light shot out at incredible speed, rolling towards the tail end of the dragon-shaped battle array.

Due to the battle array's length, the protective black light surrounding it suddenly thinned out, and was torn apart by the black light.

The black light flashed into the battle array, wrapping around several ghostly creatures.

That Taiyi realm ghostly creature saw this scene and let out a furious roar, waving the black flag wildly, and the dragon-shaped battle array immediately recoiled, shooting out crystal-like lights that flew towards the black light.

Before those lights could reach, the black light had already dragged those ghostly creatures back, and was swallowed by Tixi.

Tixi's face revealed a look of intoxication, and the black light on his body flashed and condensed.

"What's going on..." a middle-aged man in black robes, who was currently engaged in a fierce battle with Han Li, saw Tixi swallow the ghostly creatures and his face changed.

Han Li took advantage of the momentary distraction and transformed into a golden light, charging towards the middle-aged man in black robes.

At the same time, he quickly formed a seal with his hands, and a golden light flashed behind him, as the True Speech Treasure Wheel appeared and rapidly rotated.

Innumerable golden ripples appeared, enveloping the middle-aged man in black robes.

But he had already detected the movement and retreated, his speed far surpassing Han Li's.

The distance between the two rapidly opened up, and the golden ripples from the True Speech Treasure Wheel did not envelop him.

The middle-aged man in black robes turned into a streak of lightning, instantly fleeing into the dark abyss and letting out a sharp, long cry.

The two teams of ghostly soldiers, who were currently battling Tixi and Jintong, immediately retreated, flying towards the middle-aged man in black robes.

"Master, help me catch some ghostly creatures!" Tixi's face was urgent, and he chased after them, shouting.

The two teams of ghostly soldiers were flying past Han Li, and Han Li heard the shout, his hands forming a seal as the golden ripples beside him rapidly expanded, enveloping nearly a hundred ghostly creatures.

The True Speech Treasure Wheel had already materialized, its power greatly increased, and the ghostly creatures were completely immobilized, frozen in place.

The other ghostly soldiers didn't care about their trapped companions and continued to fly towards the middle-aged man in black robes, arriving by his side in the blink of an eye.

The middle-aged man in black robes deeply looked at Han Li and Tixi, then flashed into the abyss, disappearing.

The two ghostly soldier teams immediately followed, flying into the abyss.

"What's going on? Why did these ghostly creatures suddenly retreat?" Jintong flew over, having transformed back into human form, and asked in confusion.

"I don't know," Han Li replied, furrowing his brow.

He had discovered that the middle-aged man in black robes was incredibly powerful, and shouldn't have retreated so easily.

Could there be some other reason?

"Master, quickly retract the Treasure Wheel!" Tixi flew over, not caring about the middle-aged man in black robes, and shouted.

Han Li shook his head and smiled, forming a seal to retract the True Speech Treasure Wheel.

The nearly hundred ghostly creatures immediately regained their mobility, scattering in all directions, but a black spiritual domain descended, enveloping all the ghostly creatures, and they were unable to move.

Tixi opened her mouth and sucked in, the black spiritual domain rapidly shrinking, and the ghostly creatures inside were also shrinking, slowly being swallowed by the black spiritual domain.

The black spiritual domain finally transformed into a fist-sized black light sphere, flying into her mouth.

The black light on her body flashed wildly, and a series of black spiritual waves surged out, expanding in all directions, before finally calming down.

Tixi's aura had clearly increased, approaching the peak of the early Da Luo realm.

"Let's go, we'll also go down and take a look. What's inside this abyss?" Han Li said, leading the way downwards.

Tixi and Jintong followed closely behind.

As soon as the three of them entered the abyss, they felt as if they had entered a massive waterfall, being enveloped by a powerful force that propelled them downwards into the darkness.

This force was boundless, and even Han Li and the others, as powerful Da Luo existences, were unable to resist it, and were instantly swept away, plummeting downwards.
