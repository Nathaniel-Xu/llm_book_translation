Jin Li, that Li Qima is a strange and eccentric person, although he suddenly left, it's hard to say if he won't come back again. Since we're all gathered here, let's work together from now on and explore this Time Tower together," Jin Li quickly put away his sorrowful expression and began to discuss their next course of action.

"Of course, I, Lei Yu, am more than happy to follow your lead, Jin Li, Shi Li, and Su Li, please guide us," Lei Yu exclaimed, glancing at Su Zhenzhen with a hint of excitement in his eyes.

Lei Yu's companions had just witnessed the strength displayed by Jin Li and his friends, especially Han Li's exceptional cultivation, and naturally had no objections to merging their groups, nodding in agreement.

Lan Yan, although not wanting to travel with Han Li, was a single person with little influence, and speaking out against it would only make her the target of criticism, so she remained silent.

"Lei Yu, you're too kind, this place is not safe to stay for long, let's set off immediately," Jin Li smiled and said.

After a brief rest, everyone's energy had recovered somewhat, and they set off at once, flying forward.

Without Li Qima's divine power influencing the area, the howling winds had weakened significantly and no longer hindered their flight.

However, the group was cautious, fearing Li Qima's reappearance, and didn't dare to fly at full speed, reducing their speed to about half, in case of unexpected situations.

"Lei Yu, since you arrived at this layer before us, have you discovered the location of the space gate leading to the next layer?" Su Zhenzhen suddenly asked Lei Yu while they were flying.

"Actually, we also just arrived recently and haven't had a chance to thoroughly explore, we encountered Li Qima and were entangled with him until just now, so we're not too familiar with this layer," Lei Yu hastily replied.

Su Zhenzhen responded with a simple "oh" and didn't ask any further questions.

Su Zhenzhen rarely spoke to him, and Lei Yu was secretly delighted, wanting to continue the conversation.

"Lei Yu, do you know anything about that Li Qima?" Han Li suddenly flew over and interrupted, asking.

"What do you mean, Shi Li?" Lei Yu's attempt to chat was cut short, and he felt a slight annoyance, but didn't show it, asking.

"Lei Yu, you should have realized that this Time Tower is the place where the Taishang Xianjun imprisoned the demonic beasts, and Li Qima is likely the demonic beast imprisoned on this layer. You fought with him for a long time and had some conversations, surely he revealed some information?" Han Li didn't notice Lei Yu's annoyance and continued.

"That... we did fight with Li Qima for a long time, and we did have some conversations, but he didn't mention his identity, however, judging by his strength, he's likely the demonic beast imprisoned on this layer," Lei Yu hesitated before responding.

He maintained a calm expression, but in his heart, he felt a surge of regret.

Earlier, when they were battling Li Qima, they were too focused on fighting and didn't pay attention to his attempts to converse, if only they had been more attentive, they might have gathered valuable information.

Of course, Lei Yu wouldn't reveal this to Su Zhenzhen, lest he became the laughing stock.

Han Li listened to Lei Yu's response, his face flashing with a hint of skepticism, and didn't say anything further.

The group continued on in silence, flying forward for a while.

"Shi Li, do you think Lei Yu's guess was incorrect?" Su Zhenzhen suddenly asked Han Li in a whisper.

"Do you remember the white hair we found on the fourth layer?" Han Li replied in a whisper.

"That white hair and Li Qima's mane are quite similar," Su Zhenzhen, being intelligent, immediately grasped Han Li's meaning.

"It's not just similar, they're definitely the same. Although I don't know why Li Qima's mane was on the fourth layer, it's better not to assume that there's only one powerful prisoner on this layer," Han Li smiled faintly.

Su Zhenzhen's eyes sparkled, and she nodded slowly.

Lei Yu noticed Han Li and Su Zhenzhen's whispering and felt a spark of anger, but quickly suppressed it.

The group flew forward for a while, and Jin Li, who was at the front, suddenly let out a soft exclamation and stopped.

The others followed his gaze and saw a massive mountain peak in the distance, divided into two parts, both circular in shape, resembling a giant gourd.

At the base of the mountain was a group of dark green and black palaces, stretching across 20-30 acres of land, with a layout similar to the palace groups they had encountered on the previous layers.

If they weren't mistaken, the space gate leading to the next layer should be inside these palaces.

Everyone had the same thought, but no one immediately went down.

According to reason, if the space gate was indeed here, Li Qima was likely to be here as well, and no one wanted to provoke him.

"Li Qima may have taken advantage of our split groups earlier, but we still managed to force him to retreat, and now that we're all together, even if we encounter him again, I believe we can gain the upper hand. Besides, I sense that there are treasures hidden within the palaces below, let's go down and take a look," Lei Yu said loudly.

Hearing Lei Yu's analysis, the others felt a bit more at ease, and the promise of treasures within the palaces made them even more eager to explore. Under Lei Yu's lead, they flew down towards the palaces.

Han Li followed the group, landing in front of the outermost palace, which had a large, open gate with a bronze-colored plaque bearing the inscription "Ming Xin Palace" in golden letters.
As soon as they landed on the ground, his face changed slightly.

This palace was filled with a powerful restriction, and the empty space in front of the gate was also shrouded in it. This restriction had no effect on their cultivation, but their divine sense was greatly restricted.

With Han Li's powerful divine sense, he could only leave his body for less than a hundred feet.

Others also discovered this situation, and their expressions changed.

"It's just a restriction, don't be alarmed, let's go." Lei Yu Ce was also secretly shocked, but he had already spoken boldly, and couldn't take it back, so he had to pretend to be brave and stepped into the palace first.

However, he waved his hand and took out a golden bowl-shaped immortal artifact, which floated above his head, and golden light fell from it, covering his body.

Others saw this and also took out their immortal artifacts to protect themselves, then followed Lei Yu Ce into the palace.

The outermost palace was empty, except for a few pillars, there was nothing else.

The group didn't stay there, and soon walked out of the palace from a side door, heading deeper into the palace.

There were many palaces in this palace, and the group was worried that Li Qi Ma might be hiding in one of them, so they didn't dare to split up and search. Their speed was relatively slow.

Half a day passed, and they had only searched a small part of the palace.

Fortunately, they found some treasures in the palaces, and although they didn't feel bored, they didn't feel anxious either.

As they walked, there was no danger, and the group, although not careless, had relaxed their tense atmosphere.

The group walked through a long corridor and came to a palace.

This palace was much larger than the previous ones, and it was decorated with carvings of dragons and phoenixes, and the edges of the eaves had exquisite reliefs, looking like an extraordinary place.

Han Li and the others had gained a lot of benefits along the way, and their mood was quite excited. Seeing the palace in front of them, their eyes lit up.

The main gate of the palace was also open, and the group immediately wanted to enter.

But just as they were about to enter, a "hiss" sound suddenly came from around the palace, and blue light appeared, forming a blue light screen in front of the gate, blocking their way.

"Hmph!" Lei Yu Ce saw this scene, snorted coldly, and immediately snapped his fingers.

A dazzling golden light shot out from his hand, and it was a golden flying sword, its body curved like a golden snake. It looked quite extraordinary.

The golden snake flying sword flashed and turned into a golden light about a dozen feet long, slashing fiercely at the blue light screen.

The blue light screen was hit, and suddenly burst out with a dazzling blue light, making a sound like rushing water, and actually blocked the golden light.

Lei Yu Ce's attack was blocked so easily, and he felt a bit embarrassed, so he flicked his sleeve and shouted.

Six golden lights shot out from his sleeve, and they were six golden curved knives, striking the blue light screen.

The golden snake flying sword also flew out again, slashing down.

"Everyone, let's work together to break this restriction!" Wen Zhong shouted, waving his hand and shooting out a golden rainbow, striking the blue light screen.

Others heard his voice and also took out their immortal artifacts to attack.

For a moment, the immortal artifacts bombarded the blue light screen, and the colors intertwined, flashing wildly, and the blue light screen was submerged in it.

Only a dull "boom" sound came from inside, and the blue light screen finally couldn't withstand the attacks, and was broken.

The group withdrew their immortal artifacts and entered the palace.

Han Li looked at the open gate, and his brow furrowed slightly, and a faint sense of unease rose in his heart.

But this feeling only lasted for a moment, and then disappeared, and he didn't know if it was just his own tension causing a false alarm.

Han Li shook his head, dismissed the distracting thoughts, and followed the group into the palace.

The palace was quite large, with a space of about 40-50 feet in diameter, and it was quite empty, except for some stone pillars, and a long stone table in the deepest part of the palace, where a golden plaque was placed, with a line of flower-like characters written on it, which Han Li didn't recognize.

Except for the plaque, the stone table was also placed with many things, which made the group's eyes light up.
