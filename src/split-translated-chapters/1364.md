Han Li's waist was almost bent under the pressure of the three mountain peaks, and Zhu Yan suddenly smiled, her body flashing with a burst of light, and she disappeared from her original position, rushing towards Jintong.

These people seemed to have planned their move from the start, their goal was to interrupt Jintong's absorption of the void.

As Zhu Yan's figure suddenly appeared behind Jintong, Han Li's expression turned cold and he said:

"Don't think about it!"

In the next instant, a golden light appeared out of thin air, a mountain range with a winding path descended from the sky, and it seemed to have fallen directly from the air, Zhu Yan didn't even have a chance to dodge, and was directly pressed down.

Her figure was buried under the mountain range, and a burst of sand with a strong temporal law force immediately surged from all directions, wrapping her entire body.

Zhu Yan's body flashed with light, seemingly trying to struggle free from the restraint of the sand, but it had no effect, the surrounding golden sand was like quicksand, slowly trapping her.

It seemed that there were also fine roots spreading from all directions, layer by layer, wrapping around her body.

"This is bad..." Zi Shu whispered, her figure retreating backwards.

The dark sky above suddenly lit up with fire, a wave of fire rain poured down, piercing the void and falling towards the ground.

At the same time, a beast-like roar echoed.

Han Li, who had been crushed under the mountain peaks, suddenly burst out with a surge of light, his body expanding a hundred times, transforming into a three-headed, six-armed demon, and with one palm, he overturned the three great mountains on his head.

He released a powerful aura that was difficult to describe, and it directly forced Dong Li Hu to retreat.

Han Li stood in mid-air, his gaze turned, and finally saw the white-haired man who had been blocked by Zi Shu earlier, the man was sitting cross-legged in the void, with a white light circle floating beneath him.

The light circle contained dense talismans and star patterns, and a strange, ancient law force was fluctuating within, Han Li had never felt this kind of power before, it didn't belong to the five elements, nor was it related to the soul.

"You think you have the ability to do this, but it's just like this." Han Li said, looking down at the three of them.

Zi Shu's expression didn't change, she turned her head slightly and asked Meng Yuan: "Have you been delayed for so long, are you ready?"

Meng Yuan slowly opened his eyes, his pupils reflecting the light of countless stars, and he smiled: "I'm ready..."

...

The changes at the Bodhi banquet finally made the expressions of Li Yuanji and the other seven heavenly gods turn serious.

Gu Huaijin remained calm, still sitting in his wheelchair.

"Shi Kong Yu, the heavenly court and your demon domain have already signed a treaty, not to invade each other, you're bringing people to my heavenly court, do you want to restart the war?" Bai Yun Dao Zu asked, his voice stern.

"In the past, your heavenly court invaded our demon domain, killing many of our clan members, today we're here to avenge that blood feud." Mo Zhu said slowly.

The demon domain's army behind him shouted in unison, their eyes turning red with anger.

The barbarian tribes and the heavenly court had a deep-seated hatred, and it didn't need to be said that the barbarian tribes were filled with hatred, looking at the cultivators in the Jade Pool, if not for Bai Ze's strict orders, the barbarian tribes would have already attacked.

Bai Yun Dao Zu looked at the dark army surrounding him, his heart shocked.

The heavenly court was currently under his control, and the specific affairs of the Bodhi banquet, as well as the deployment of the heavenly court's troops, were all arranged by him.

The Jade Pool was located deep within the heavenly court, and the heavenly court had set up countless layers of restrictions over the years, forming a copper wall and iron fortress, with many Dao Zu and Da Luo existences stationed around it, he thought he was safe, but the demon domain and the barbarian true spirits had somehow managed to sneak in.

Bai Yun Dao Zu's face turned ugly, he glanced at the gathering of true immortals, his eyes flashing.

Although the number of people who came to the Bodhi banquet was much smaller than the demon domain and the barbarian true spirits, these people were all top-notch existences from the true immortal realm, with extraordinary strength.

There were over a hundred Da Luo realm cultivators, and three Dao Zu existences, including Cang Wu True Lord.

In terms of high-end combat power, they still had the upper hand.

With this thought, Bai Yun Dao Zu's anxious heart relaxed slightly, and he turned to look at Gu Huaijin, waiting for his instructions.

Gu Huaijin didn't respond to Mo Zhu and Bai Ze, instead, he turned to look at the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth, just as he was about to say something, he suddenly waved his right hand, and a golden giant palm appeared in the void, grabbing downwards.

A figure stumbled out of the void, and was thrown downwards, it was the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth.

The other Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth, who was sitting on the platform, shook his body, and his figure dissipated.

The golden giant palm didn't stop, its surface flashing with golden light, and it grabbed downwards again.

The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth's face turned cold, a dark red glow flashed on his body, and he stabilized his body, punching upwards.

"Boom!" The sound of the collision echoed.
A dark red six-pointed wheel appeared above his head, rapidly spinning and emitting a massive attractive force, causing the minds of all people inside and outside the Jade Pool to violently tremble, as if being sucked away by the wheel.

Before he could react, the golden giant palm descended, and the two collided with a deafening crash, sending shockwaves through the air.

A brilliant flash of gold and red light illuminated the surroundings, but just as it seemed about to expand, four figures suddenly appeared beside the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth.

It was Li Yuanji, Chi Rong, Bai Yun Daozu, and the dwarf elder, who emitted a brilliant four-colored light that instantly formed a dense, four-colored shield, enveloping the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth and the exploding golden and red light.

The shield seemed impenetrable, with countless four-colored talismans dancing within, yet without any conflict.

This appeared to be a collaborative divine ability, with the shield exerting a powerful, suffocating force that made it difficult for the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth to move.

The golden and red light was also suppressed, trapped within the shield and soon dispersing, merging with the four-colored talismans.

A series of rapid changes left everyone stunned, and the Demon Lord, White Ze, and others reacted by unleashing their own divine abilities.

Guo or Jin's gaze shifted, and he glanced at Chen Ruyan and the hidden Ming Daozu, his eyes flickering with a hint of surprise.

Chen Ruyan's eyebrows furrowed, and she vanished, reappearing beside White Ze and the others.

She was accompanied by a middle-aged man in a snowy-white robe, as icy as a block of ice.

"Three noble True Spirit Kings of the Barbarian Realm, I do not wish to fight you, please do not force me," Chen Ruyan said calmly.

As she spoke, a blue glow enveloped her body, and in its depths, a ancient, blue stone door became visible, radiating an endless, desolate aura, as if it had existed since the dawn of time.

Within the door, waves surged and receded, and at first glance, it seemed ordinary, but upon closer inspection, the door appeared boundless, encompassing the entire world, with countless waves crashing down, threatening to crush everything in their path.

"Is this the Gate of the Ten Thousand Waters?" White Ze, Yue Mian, and the bald giant's faces changed, and they halted their advance.

Meanwhile, the Demon Lord's shadow flickered, and the hidden Ming Daozu appeared, standing alone before the Demon Realm's cultivators.

The Demon Lord's eyes flashed, and he halted his movement.

However, the obese woman in white beside him did not stop, sneering as she conjured a massive black wolf-toothed club, which she swung with a mighty roar.

The black club grew, transforming into a colossal black shadow that struck the hidden Ming Daozu with the force of a mountain.

The Demon Lord's face changed, but he did not intervene.

The hidden Ming Daozu did not dodge, and the black club struck him with a deafening crash.

His body exploded, but instead of blood, a massive cloud of black smoke erupted.

"What sorcery is this?" the obese woman exclaimed, her eyes widening in surprise, before she let out a blood-curdling scream, as if trapped in a nightmare.

She wildly swung her black club, conjuring a maelstrom of black wind that threatened to disperse the smoke.

However, just as she did, her eyes turned glassy, and her face contorted in terror, as if she had fallen prey to some illusion.

The three Demon Realm cultivators who had been about to attack halted, their faces pale.

The Demon Lord's expression turned grim, and he swept his sleeve.

The space around the obese woman rippled, and countless waves appeared, as if the air had turned to water.

The black club's shadows struck the waves, only to become trapped within.

The obese woman struggled to free herself, but the waves spread, engulfing her body up to her waist.

The Demon Lord appeared beside her, his finger touching her brow.

The obese woman's face returned to normal, and she thanked the Demon Lord, still panting.

It seemed that her brief madness had exhausted her greatly.

The Demon Lord's expression remained calm as he waved his hand, restoring the space to normal.

The obese woman turned to face the hidden Ming Daozu, who reappeared, standing as still as before, as if he had never moved.

The obese woman's eyes widened in shock, and she took a step back, her face pale.
