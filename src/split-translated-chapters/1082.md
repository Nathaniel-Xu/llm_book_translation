Chapter:

Everyone saw that Lei Yuze and Su Ci at the bottom of the pit were not moving, and Wen Zhong shouted loudly and rushed down.

Jin Liu also quickly shot down, taking the lead and pulling Lei Yuze away from Su Ci. Wen Zhong then helped the almost unsteady Lei Yuze.

"Are you okay?" Jin Liu saw that Su Ci's expression was different and asked while supporting her shoulders.

Su Ci's shoulders shook, and she avoided his hands, turning to look at Lei Yuze.

Lei Yuze, who was being held by Jin Liu, had already taken a medicinal pill, and his chest was still heaving violently.

Sensing Su Ci's gaze, he also turned his eyes to her, his soft and gentle expression shaking his head to indicate that he was fine.

Su Ci's heart was slightly touched, and she looked away, knowing that if Lei Yuze hadn't been protecting her, he wouldn't have been injured so severely.

Lei Yuze saw her reaction and didn't feel disappointed, just smiling habitually and sitting up with Wen Zhong's support. He began to circulate his internal energy, and the remaining purple lightning and golden light in his wounds burst out, emitting a "crackling" sound. The pain made his face contort, but he didn't make a sound.

The Lanyuan siblings watched this scene, and their eyes couldn't help but flash with a hint of admiration.

Su Ci's eyes flashed with a hint of pity, and she walked to Lei Yuze's side, turning her wrist to take out a small, sky-blue ceramic bottle and handing it to Lei Yuze. "This is the Waters of Heaven Pill from our Tian Shui Sect, which isn't the most effective at healing but has some benefits in repairing internal energy. If you use it with other medicinal pills, you can recover quickly."

"Thank you, Su Xianzi..." Lei Yuze accepted the bottle with both hands, his eyes shining with surprise.

He then took out a medicinal pill, swallowed it, and closed his eyes to meditate again.

"I didn't expect that our all-or-nothing gamble would still fail. What should we do now?" Jin Liu's gaze fell on Su Ci, and his eyes flashed with a hint of displeasure as he asked.

Wen Zhong hummed and didn't speak.

Lan Yan's expression also turned unhappy, and he was about to reprimand Jin Liu, but Lan Yuanzi stopped him.

After his encounter with Han Li, Lan Yuanzi had become even more low-key. He shook his head, indicating that Lan Yan should not make a fuss.

Lan Yan furrowed his brow but eventually held back.

Just then, they felt a sudden sensation and lifted their heads to look into the distance. They saw Han Li and his group of four or five people flying towards them from afar.

Han Li saw the desolate scene on the ground and furrowed his brow.

After they landed, Lei Yuze also opened his eyes, his gaze falling on Qu Lin, and his expression changed slightly.

"You didn't take a different route, so how did you end up here?" Jin Liu's brow furrowed as he asked.

"Heh, when did the Years Tower become your private property, Jin friend? We can go wherever we want, and you have to control us?" Huo San spoke up, his tone slightly unhappy.

"You..." Jin Liu was taken aback.

"Stone friend, who is this?" Lei Yuze asked, looking at Qu Lin.

"This is Qu Lin, a friend who has been sealed in the Years Tower for many years. He has reached an agreement with me to help us pass through the tower." Han Li introduced him briefly.

"Stone friend, forgive me for being presumptuous, but the people sealed in this tower aren't all benevolent. Reaching an agreement with them is like plotting with a tiger, and I hope you'll think carefully..." Lei Yuze didn't respond directly, instead using his internal energy to transmit a message.

"Thank you, Lei friend, for your good intentions. Shi has his own judgment." Han Li felt puzzled, wondering why Lei Yuze was warning him, and didn't explain further.

"Is this the Nine Dragon Lock God's seal?" Huo San suddenly stepped forward.

"Friend, you also know this formation?" Lei Yuze's eyes flashed as he asked.

"The dragon scales have been moved, and it's a bit tricky..." Huo San examined the formation carefully before speaking.

"Not bad, but if we want to find a way to break the seal, it'll take at least two days. However, I tried to break the formation earlier, and the array counterattacked, injuring me severely. I'm afraid I'll need more time." Lei Yuze shook his head, sighing.

Han Li's gaze fell on the formation, and he carefully examined it for a moment before making a decision.

If he were to break the formation, it would only take half a day.

However, before he could speak, Qu Lin had already stepped forward and began to press the symbols on the stone door.

"What are you doing? Don't touch it!" Lei Yuze's expression changed, and he hastily shouted.
Only he was heavily injured, and after shouting once, he was unable to stop.

"What's the commotion about? Can't you see? The array is broken," Qu Lin said expressionlessly, not stopping his movements, and said casually.

"I've just figured out that the Dragon Scale Lock's passive effects have been changed, and your reckless pressing will only add more variables, don't be reckless," Lei Yu Ce said furiously.

Wen Zhong, who was on the side, made a move to stop him.

Jin Liu, however, stood by, waiting to see the array's backlash, and was ready to pull Su Qian away.

Han Li's eyes flickered slightly, and he didn't intervene.

At this time, Qu Lin pressed down on another symbol, and the stone archway above suddenly burst into a red glow. The nine dark golden chains that were tied to the light screen immediately made a "clattering" sound, and retreated back into the four directions.

The Nine Dragon Lock God's Seal Array, which had been a thorn in their side, was thus broken.

Everyone was shocked by this.

"Was it you who modified the Nine Dragon Lock God's Seal Array?" Han Li asked, his eyes flashing with a hint of surprise.

"That's right. At the time, I thought that if I could reach the seventh layer, I might have a chance to leave this place, so I tried to open it. But when I reached the seventh layer, I encountered that old madman who was being imprisoned, and he beat me half to death. I barely escaped, and afterwards, I relocked the array and modified it to make it stronger," Qu Lin replied directly.

"Can this seal be reversed?" Han Li asked, puzzled.

"I was lucky to have left a way out. After I reached the seventh layer, I set up the Hunyuan Nine Palace Array, which also served as a way out for myself," Qu Lin replied.

"Since Brother Qu is skilled in array techniques and has already helped us break the seal, let's not waste any more time. Let's hurry through," Han Li said, turning to the others.

Lei Yu Ce was about to ask some questions, but seeing Han Li's words, he didn't speak up.

Seeing that Jin Liu and Lei Yu Ce didn't immediately enter the door, Han Li and Bao San exchanged a glance, and their eyes flashed with a hint of hesitation. They didn't move either.

"Since you're not willing to enter, I'll go first." Qu Lin sneered, and stepped through the stone archway, disappearing into the dark red glow.

Han Li saw this, and his eyes flickered slightly. He covered himself with a layer of protective light, and walked towards the dark red glow.

But just as he did, a sudden change occurred!

Han Li took a step forward, and his foot had just landed when a yellow glow suddenly erupted from the ground. A whirlpool of yellow earth suddenly appeared, and a powerful force surged out from within.

Because the whirlpool appeared so suddenly, there was almost no warning, and Han Li was caught off guard. His foot stepped into the whirlpool, and he was sucked in, his lower half disappearing into the earth.

The moment he fell into the whirlpool, Han Li's Tian Xie Zhen Yu Gong began to circulate, and his body burst forth with starlight energy. His feet made a "popping" sound, and he shot out of the whirlpool like he was walking on air.

But just as he emerged from the whirlpool, a muddy substance like mud burst out from within, wrapping around his ankle and pulling him back into the whirlpool.

Han Li felt a strange power emanating from the mud, and his entire foot went numb. He looked down and saw that his foot had turned gray and stone-like.

He gritted his teeth, and his other foot swept towards the mud, his toes glowing with golden light. A burst of golden lightning erupted, cutting through the mud like a knife.

Han Li's body flew back, and he landed on the edge of a massive pit. He looked back at the whirlpool, and saw that the mud had fallen into the pit, and a yellow figure slowly emerged from the earth.

It was a woman in a wide yellow robe, her face twisted in an ugly expression.

"Shi Chan, Elder! How did you end up here...?" the Blue Yuanzi siblings exclaimed in shock.

"Hmph! How did I end up here? You two idiots, you've been chasing him for so long, but you still haven't caught him. I had to come here, or you'd never be able to explain yourselves to the sect," the yellow-robed woman said, her eyes flashing with anger.

Han Li stared at Shi Chan, and tried to move his petrified foot. He found that he had regained sensation, but his blood vessels still felt sluggish.

"I warn you all, this person's name is Han Li, a wanted fugitive from the Tian Xuan's Wheel of Reincarnation. He has committed countless crimes in the various immortal realms, and was responsible for the death of the Golden Source Palace's Master, Dongfang Bai. If you help me capture him, you will be rewarded with great merit, and will bring honor to yourselves and your sect. What do you say?" Shi Chan asked, her eyes scanning the group.

Lei Yu Ce and the others were shocked, their bodies trembling with surprise.

It seemed that Shi Chan's words had been too shocking.
