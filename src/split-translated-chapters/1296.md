The Great Marsh's vast area is too wide, the water map I drew is only based on our location as the origin, along the hidden waterway, covering an area of hundreds of miles around.

The Ghost Witch's face turned pale, her voice somewhat weak, said.

Looking at her, it seemed that her soul power had been exhausted.

Ti Hu saw this, and with a swift gesture, shot a dark red glow from her hands towards the black wooden box. The red glow spread out, enveloping the Ghost Witch's shadow.

The Ghost Witch's body was bathed in the glow, and only then did she slightly recover, thanking Ti Hu.

"Thank you."

Han Li examined the jade slip once, and did not immediately put it away. Instead, he raised his head, and a flash of purple light appeared in his eyes as he probed the depths of the Great Marsh.

Under the power of his Nine Yin Demon Eyes, the originally elusive whirlpools were now visible to Han Li.

The closer to the lake's edge, the smaller and more difficult to discern the whirlpools were. The closer to the center of the lake, the stronger and more distinct the whirlpools were. Near the Blood Cloud, they were even more turbulent, mixing with the water vapor and heavenly energy, creating a chaotic scene.

This was consistent with what the Ghost Witch had said, but Han Li couldn't find any pattern in the whirlpools, nor could he find the hidden waterway the Ghost Witch had mentioned.

"Ghost Witch, the distribution of these whirlpools seems different from the water map you drew?" Han Li asked, furrowing his brow.

"The whirlpools are constantly changing, so what I drew is only the water map when the waterway appears. We're not going to follow the map immediately, but wait for the water to change and match the map. When that happens, the waterway will naturally appear." The Ghost Witch explained.

"Wait... how long will we have to wait?" Han Li asked, deep in thought.

"The whirlpools on the Great Marsh are unpredictable, and without long-term observation, it's impossible to accurately grasp the pattern. However, judging from the Blood Cloud's situation, it shouldn't be too long. At most, it will take a year, and the waterway will definitely appear." The Ghost Witch said.

Han Li gazed at the Blood Cloud in the Great Marsh, deep in thought, and said:

"Then let's wait."

Han Li and his companions temporarily stayed in the stone fortress on the lake's edge, waiting for over half a year.

On this day, the winds on the Great Marsh were strong, and the massive whirlpool that had originally only been at the center of the lake had now spread to almost the entire lake, only a few dozen miles from the lake's edge.

"The time has come, it's now! Haha..." The Ghost Witch laughed loudly.

"Now? You're not joking, are you? The situation is even worse than before!" Shi Chuan Kong exclaimed.

The others were also tense, looking worried.

"You don't understand, the birth gate is hidden within the death gate. Previously, the small whirlpools were dense and numerous, but now they've merged into larger, more sparse ones, and only then will the hidden passage appear." The Ghost Witch explained.

Han Li's eyes flashed with purple light as he carefully examined the lake's scenery. He also discovered that the whirlpools' distribution was now consistent with the water map the Ghost Witch had drawn.

"It's true, I can see the entrance to the waterway that the Ghost Witch mentioned. It should be correct." Han Li said.

"Everyone, let's hurry! The Great Marsh is full of variables, and this situation can only last for a few hours. We can't afford to delay." The Ghost Witch said.

"I'll take Ti Hu and the Ghost Witch on the boat, while the rest of you stay in my Flower Branch Cave. Once we arrive, we'll act together." Han Li said.

The others naturally had no objections, nodding in agreement.

Han Li then waved his hand, and a silver light flashed in front of him. The silver light door appeared, and Jingong, Shi Chuan Kong, and Ziling all entered.

As they entered the Flower Branch Cave, Han Li closed the silver light door and said to Ti Hu:

"Let's go..."

"I'll be careful and control the boat. You use your divine soul technique to scout the surroundings and keep an eye on the Ghost Witch. If he makes any suspicious moves, immediately kill him. But don't worry, I have a way to get you out of here." Han Li transmitted to Ti Hu.

After advancing to the mid-stage of the Great Luo, Han Li's confidence had increased greatly.

"I'll be careful." Ti Hu replied.

With that, the two of them jumped into the air and landed on the lake's edge.

Han Li waved his hand, and a green light flashed, creating a small, exquisite boat that floated on the lake's surface.

As before, the boat was as light as a feather, and only created a small ripple on the water's surface.

Han Li jumped onto the boat, followed by Ti Hu, who stood behind him.

"Ghost Witch, we're setting off. If there's any change, please remind me." Han Li said, placing the black wooden box at the bow of the boat.

A wisp of green smoke emerged from the box, taking the shape of the Ghost Witch, who smiled and said:

"Han Li, don't worry, we're in this together now. Our lives are connected, and I wouldn't dare not do my best."
Han Li nodded and waved his sleeve, sending a gust of wind sweeping across the lake. The bamboo boat shot out like an arrow, moving so quickly that it seemed to be gliding across the surface of the lake rather than breaking through the water.

As they sped along, Han Li saw that the boat was headed straight for a massive whirlpool. He quickly raised his hand and took out a long bamboo pole, striking the water with a loud crack. The boat's trajectory changed, and it slid past the whirlpool, narrowly avoiding being sucked in.

"Ah, be careful, be careful!" Gu Wu exclaimed, her voice trembling with worry.

Han Li steadied the boat and began to slow down, navigating through a narrow passage between two whirlpools. As they entered the hidden waterway, the lake's surface was calm, but as they progressed deeper, the whirlpools grew stronger, making it increasingly difficult to control the boat.

Han Li focused all his attention on steering the boat, often relying on Gu Wu to guide him. "Turn left, avoid the big whirlpool, and you'll see the cloud wall behind it!" Gu Wu shouted.

Han Li quickly adjusted the boat's course, using the bamboo pole to steer it around the massive whirlpool. As they emerged on the other side, Han Li's eyes widened as he saw a massive red cloud wall blocking their path.

He quickly inserted the bamboo pole into the water to stop the boat from moving forward. "What's going on?" he asked Gu Wu.

Gu Wu looked just as shocked, her eyes wide with incredulity. Han Li's brow furrowed in concern.

"This can't be," Gu Wu muttered, "there's supposed to be a gap here..."

Han Li glanced at Gu Wu, then at the cloud wall, his eyes narrowing in suspicion. Suddenly, his gaze shifted, and his eyes flashed with a deep purple light as he used his spiritual senses to examine the cloud wall.

"Ah," he exclaimed, "the waterway is still there, but it's been obscured by the scattered cloud energy."

Gu Wu followed Han Li's gaze and saw that the cloud wall was indeed thinner at the bottom. "Let's go," Han Li said, his voice low and urgent.

With a swift motion, Han Li swept the bamboo pole across the water, and the boat surged forward, crashing into the cloud wall. The sound of the impact was muffled, and the air grew thick with the scent of blood.

As they emerged on the other side, Han Li's vision cleared, and he saw that they were surrounded by towering walls of crimson cloud. The air was filled with the sound of rushing wind, and the clouds seemed to be pulling and tugging at the air.

Gu Wu let out a sigh of relief. "We made it out."

Han Li's expression was calm as he gazed around, taking in their surroundings. "It seems we've entered a safe zone," Gu Wu said, "at least half of the journey should be uneventful from now on."

Han Li raised an eyebrow. "Safe zone?"

Gu Wu chuckled. "I just made it up, it's a good omen, hehe..."

Han Li didn't respond, instead focusing on steering the boat forward.

Meanwhile, in the heart of the Yellow Springs, a massive ring of whirlpools formed a circular barrier, surrounded by a thick wall of crimson cloud. Inside this isolated area, the air was calm and peaceful, with no signs of whirlwinds.

At the center of this region, a lone island floated, shaped like a wheel. Six mountain ridges radiated from the island's center, forming a pattern that resembled the spokes of a wheel.

The island was covered in stone stairways and simple pavilions, but despite the lack of vegetation, it didn't seem desolate. At the island's center stood a magnificent stone temple, its walls a deep gray color.

The temple was surrounded by four broad plazas, each with a different size and shape. A thick fog swirled around each plaza, and ghostly soldiers patrolled the area, their eyes glowing with an otherworldly energy.
