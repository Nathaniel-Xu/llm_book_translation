As the sword energy and golden lightning swept in, the Evil Ghost Judge felt that the outside world was no longer isolated from his spiritual domain. Instead, he could only sense the intense and unmatched power of the lightning.

He could no longer continue writing in mid-air, and with a flick of his wrist, he drew a single stroke in the void, pointing downwards.

The blood-colored characters that had been suspended in mid-air suddenly came to life, falling towards the ground with a loud rumble. As they descended, their surface grew brighter and more intense, becoming heavier and heavier.

By the time they reached the sword array, each character had become as massive as a mountain, pressing down on the surrounding space and causing it to collapse. Black cracks appeared all around, and the sword energy that had been accumulating was released in a frenzy.

The golden lightning sword energy was countless in number, sweeping in wave after wave, and accumulating into a dense, golden net that ensnared all the blood-colored characters.

As the characters entered the sword net, they immediately began to boil and churn, releasing a loud hissing sound. The sword net's energy and the lightning worked together to erode the characters, causing them to release intense, white smoke and slowly disappear.

After a few breaths, the blood-colored characters finally collapsed, disappearing into nothingness. But just as they did, a massive hand descended from the sky, palm facing downwards.

In the center of the palm, a massive, blood-colored vortex appeared, with a single, golden character "æ••" floating in the center. The hand's power was even more intense than the previous blood-colored chapter, and all the sword energy was drawn into the vortex, shattering into fragments.

The sword net was torn apart, and the sword energy scattered in all directions. Han Li, however, remained calm, his expression unchanged. He changed his sword technique and began to chant once more.

As his voice echoed out, the Heavenly Sword Array's sword energy surged forth, and thirty-six golden lightning columns shot up into the sky, gathering together to form a massive, golden cloud.

The cloud's interior flashed with lightning symbols, and a mysterious energy emanated from within, growing stronger by the second. The Evil Ghost Judge's expression finally changed, his face contorting in shock.

Before he could react, Han Li took a step forward, his footwork swift and decisive, and activated the sword array with all his might.

The golden cloud in the sky began to churn and twist, disrupting the surrounding space and causing a massive, heavenly energy to burst forth. The air was filled with the sound of thunder, and the sword energy was released in a frenzy.

The thirty-six bamboo swords trembled with energy, their golden lightning filaments flashing as they shot out into the air. The cloud's interior was filled with layer upon layer of golden energy, and within its depths, two massive, golden pillars appeared, forming a massive, golden gate.

The gate's pillars were adorned with golden lightning symbols, and the air was filled with the sound of thunder. The Evil Ghost Judge's face twisted in shock, and he let out a furious roar.

Han Li, however, remained calm, his hands moving in a slow, deliberate motion as he pushed open the gate. The golden gate creaked open, revealing a narrow slit.

A deafening sound echoed through the air, and a massive, golden lightning bolt shot out from the gate, pouring down towards the ground like a waterfall. The gate's interior was filled with a boundless, golden sea, and the air was filled with the sound of thunder.

The golden lightning symbols on the gate flashed, and the dense, golden energy was released, forming into a multitude of golden swords that shot out towards the Evil Ghost Judge. The sound of thunder and the clash of swords filled the air, and the space was filled with a massive, golden storm.

The Evil Ghost Judge's face contorted in shock, and he let out a furious roar. He opened his ancient, leather-bound book, and a massive, blood-colored light burst forth, releasing a multitude of ghostly spirits that shot out into the air.

The spirits were of all shapes and sizes, from small, childlike figures to massive, mountain-like forms. They were all twisted and distorted, their faces filled with malevolent energy. They shot out into the air, colliding with the golden swords in a frenzy of sound and energy.

The space was filled with the sound of thunder and the clash of swords, and the air was filled with the energy of the golden storm.
In the high sky, the golden and crimson light intertwined, almost splitting the atmosphere into two layers, with neither side able to gain the upper hand. The battle had turned into a prolonged war of attrition.

Han Li stood still, gazing up at the sky, his hands tightly grasping the sword's hilt, not daring to relax for a moment.

This Heaven-Piercing Sword Array was extraordinary, and with his current cultivation, the power it unleashed was not to be underestimated. However, the Array's power would only grow stronger with time, so he believed that ultimately, he would emerge victorious.

"Boom, boom, boom"

The continuous explosions lasted for about a quarter of an hour, and the void trembled unceasingly. The golden sword rain in the sky showed no signs of weakening, and Ghost Spirit finally grew anxious.

His body emerged from the brow of the Evil Ghost Judge, his hands swiftly forming a seal, and his fingers pointing at the crimson brush.

Suddenly, a symbol on the brush's tip lit up, and the massive brush shrunk rapidly, transforming into a delicate flying sword amidst a burst of blood light.

"Whoosh"

The crimson flying sword shot out, leaving behind a trail of fragmented shadows, and flew straight towards Han Li.

Han Li was currently fully focused on controlling the sword array, and his brow furrowed as he saw the flying sword approaching.

"Ah, if only I could stall for a bit longer..." he sighed, his voice laced with regret.

Immediately, the golden circular moon behind him released a dazzling golden light, weaving a dense temporal law space around his body.

The crimson flying sword, upon entering the golden space, slowed down significantly.

The Evil Ghost Judge felt the golden light piercing his eyes, and he quickly raised his hand to suppress it.

A symbol on his palm glowed brightly, and the flying sword's speed surged once more, piercing through the golden light's center.

"Whoosh"

The crimson flying sword passed through the area where Han Li stood, but landed in empty space.

"Die!" a sudden explosion of anger echoed from above.

The Evil Ghost Judge looked up, and saw a tall figure standing before the giant heavenly gate, holding a long sword, and was about to make a downward slash. It was none other than Han Li.

Ghost Spirit's heart skipped a beat.

In the next instant, Han Li's sword had already descended, slashing downwards.

His hand grasped the Qingtian Bee Cloud Sword, and with a swift motion, he swung it from behind his head, the sword's path illuminated by electricity, as it cut through the air, and the heavenly gate's inner lightning pool was drawn out, merging with the sword's body.

"Boom, boom, boom"

The thunderous roars shook the air, and the sword's blade, infused with the lightning, tore through the void, splitting the clouds, and simultaneously cutting through the sword rain and the dark souls below.

The blade landed on the Evil Ghost Judge's head with incredible force.

"No..."

A pitiful cry echoed, and the judge's crown was split in two, followed by his head, neck, and torso, all of which were torn apart by a golden fissure.

"Rip"

A sound like tearing fabric echoed, and the Evil Ghost Judge's body was torn asunder, releasing a massive amount of dark energy, which transformed into a black mist that spread in all directions.

Within the mist, countless green flames scattered, flying towards the four cardinal directions.

At the same time, the blood-red space surrounding them was severed, and the blood-red color receded, revealing the desolate ruins around them.

"Qihu..." Han Li shouted.

Qihu, attuned to his master's will, had already flown to the high sky, and with a flash of black light, transformed into a massive, ape-like creature, and began to absorb the black mist into its belly.

Meanwhile, Han Li, standing on the golden cloud, finally collapsed, and the Heaven-Piercing Sword Array disappeared.

The remaining evil spirits, now without control, fled in disarray, and were devoured by Qihu.

The remaining ones retreated back into the ancient, thick book.

As Han Li fell to the ground, Lan Yuan flew over, and landed beside him, concerned.

"Han friend, how are you?"

"No harm done," Han Li replied, taking out two pills and swallowing them.

He waved his hand, and the thirty-six Qingtian Bee Cloud Swords, used to set up the array, flew back to him.

After this battle, the swords' inner Heavenly Thunder had been almost completely released, and they could not be used again for the time being.

"The Ghost Spirit Envoy... he..." Lan Yuan's brow furrowed, asking.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he replied, "He's been defeated."
