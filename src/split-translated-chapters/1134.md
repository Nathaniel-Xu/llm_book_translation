Hei Tian Mozhu showed little interest in the conversation between Han Li and the others.

He seemed excited about what he saw, constantly looking around, and after a while, he came to the edge of the deep pit and squatted down, stroking his chin as if thinking about something. Suddenly, his body flashed and he plunged straight down into the pit.

On the ground, there were still houses-sized rocks and fireballs, and Hei Tian seemed to be very interested in them. He walked around the fireballs, occasionally stretching out his hand to make a gesture of roasting.

Just as Han Li and the others were talking, a sudden spatial fluctuation came from the void not far away.

A flash of light, and three figures stumbled out.

Han Li and the others had just gone through a big battle, and their nerves were still on high alert. Seeing the sudden appearance of these people, they all had a strong aura of spiritual energy, as if they were about to engage in a fierce battle.

The three people seemed to be frightened as well. The leader, an old man with copper coin scales on his body, had a flash of crystal light, and six snow-white ice crystals appeared, releasing a cold aura.

The tall, green-skinned man beside him, who looked like dry tree bark, seemed to be afraid of the cold aura and quickly dodged to the side. A green light surrounded him, and countless green roots grew out from under his feet, piercing into the scorched earth.

The old man in gray robes, on the other hand, seemed more normal, but his clothes were fluttering without wind, and a golden wave pattern was rippling out from his body.

Just as everyone was about to draw their swords, Liu Zijian suddenly spoke up: "Hua Yangzi, aren't you Hua Yangzi?"

This sudden question made Han Li and the others feel a bit surprised, and even the three people opposite them were taken aback.

The old man in gray robes frowned, carefully looked at Liu Zijian, and then said in surprise: "Liu Zijian, Liu friend... is it really you?"

Liu Zijian smiled wistfully and said: "It's me. I didn't expect to meet you again after so many years."

Hua Yangzi shook his head and said: "Fate is really unpredictable. Fate is really unpredictable..."

Han Li and the others didn't immediately put down their guard, but instead looked at the two of them with strange expressions.

"Don't worry, Hua Yangzi is an old friend, not an enemy," Liu Zijian said, putting away his divine abilities.

Hua Yangzi saw this and waved his hand, signaling the two people beside him to put away their divine abilities as well.

Only then did everyone calm down and approach each other.

"I didn't expect to see you again after so many years..." Hua Yangzi sighed and said.

"I also didn't expect it. I've been searching for you for many years, but I never thought I'd see you again," Liu Zijian said.

"What happened to you back then? You disappeared in the Mo Hai Xian Domain, and I went to look for you, but I couldn't find any news of you. I only knew that you went to explore a secret realm at the bottom of the Wang Cen Hai, but then you vanished," Liu Zijian asked.

Hua Yangzi said: "I was invited by an old friend in the Mo Hai Xian Palace to explore a secret realm in the Chi Long Hai Gou. But I was betrayed and captured by the palace, and then I was imprisoned in the Xian Yu and later sealed in the Sui Yue Tower. I only escaped when the tower was affected by some changes."

Liu Zijian was shocked: "What? You were also imprisoned in the Sui Yue Tower? I didn't know that."

Hua Yangzi looked at Liu Zijian with a puzzled expression: "You were also imprisoned in the tower? I didn't know that either."

Liu Zijian asked: "Why are you looking at me like that? Don't you believe me?"

Hua Yangzi said: "It's not that I don't believe you, but as a cultivator of your level, if you were captured by the Heavenly Court, your cultivation shouldn't be so... unstable. Didn't they extract your law energy?"

Liu Zijian looked at him carefully and said: "Extract law energy? Did the Heavenly Court do that to you? No wonder I see that your cultivation is still at a high level, but it's not very stable."

Hua Yangzi nodded and said: "Not just me, many cultivators in the Xian Yu were treated the same way. Our law energy was extracted, and then we were thrown into the Sui Yue Tower."
"Speaking of which, back then you didn't submit to the Heavenly Court, but you were still on good terms with them, and you could be considered a carefree wandering immortal. Why would they take action against you? Is there something special about your Law Threads?" Liu Zixin frowned and asked.

"If we talk about the power of the Law, it's all about cultivating and understanding the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth. Even if they share the same origin, they each have their own unique understanding. Who doesn't have something special about them? But the Heavenly Court doesn't seem to care about this. They've captured many cultivators, including humans, demons, and magical creatures, and even the spirits of plants and trees. The power of their Law Arrays doesn't have any commonalities, and this whole thing is full of mysteries." Huai Yangzi shook his head and said.

"Huai Yangzi, senior, what is the purpose of the Heavenly Court extracting your Law Threads?" Jiao San couldn't help but ask.

Han Li was also very curious about this, and when he saw Jiao San ask, he perked up his ears to listen.

"I don't know... from the beginning to the end, we didn't know what they wanted to extract so many Law Threads for. Compared to this, I find it even more strange that your Law Threads weren't extracted," Huai Yangzi shook his head and said.

"We don't know either, we only remember that we were imprisoned in the Immortal Realm for a short time before being tricked by Wen Tai Sui into being taken to the Years Tower. After that, we were imprisoned until now. Ah, where were you imprisoned in the Years Tower?" Liu Zixin asked.

"I was imprisoned in the seventh layer of the Years Tower, along with many other cultivators. We were all sealed underground and were in a state of semi-hibernation. I don't know how many years ago, the restrictive power of the tower suddenly loosened, and we slowly recovered our Law Threads, but we couldn't move freely," Huai Yangzi said.

"Ah, I was imprisoned in the fifth layer, no wonder we never met. Hehe, we've been in the same place for so many years, if not for today's events, who knows when we would have met again?" Liu Zixin glanced at the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor, who was still playing with fire in the giant pit, and said.

Han Li listened to the conversation between the three, and his expression didn't change much, but his heart was shocked.

The Heavenly Court, as the most authoritative official power in the True Immortal Realm, shouldn't do anything too outrageous. If what Huai Yangzi said was true, and they dared to do something so bold, yet remained undiscovered, then their plans must be huge.

Unfortunately, the clues were too few, and he couldn't guess anything.

"Everyone, excuse me for saying this, but this place isn't exactly a good place to be. I think we should leave as soon as possible. Whatever we need to discuss, we can do it later," Han Li said after thinking for a moment.

"That's right. We've made a big commotion here, and I believe the Heavenly Court will send someone to clean up soon. Let's leave first and discuss our plans later," Jiao San nodded in agreement.

"What are your plans, senior?" Liu Zixin asked Huai Yangzi.

"Now that things have come to this, I don't have anything to hide. Back then, the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall wanted to recruit me, but I didn't accept. For the sake of self-preservation, I didn't want to get involved. Now, I don't know if the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall will still accept me, or if they'll even want to," Huai Yangzi sighed and said.

"If you want to join the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall, I can introduce you," Jiao San said with a smile.

As soon as he said this, the twenty or so people who had been planning to follow Jiao San were taken aback, and some of them looked at each other uncertainly. After a moment, they shook their heads and fell silent again.

"Ah, you're from the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall?" Huai Yangzi looked at Jiao San with surprise.

Jiao San just smiled and didn't respond.

"If not for them, we'd still be imprisoned in the tower," Liu Zixin said.

"Ah, I see. It seems I owe them a debt of gratitude. I'll follow you to the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall," Huai Yangzi said, his expression changing to one of determination.

"Good, good, good. Let's go," Huai Yangzi said, and then turned to the two people beside him and asked, "What about you, Mo Xu and Wu Qi?"

"We're in a similar situation to yours. We've also been imprisoned for a long time, and we're also looking for a way out. Why don't we join the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall together?" Wu Qi, the old man with the green skin, smiled and said.

The dry tree-like man just nodded and grunted in response.

"Brother Han, what are your plans? Will you join us in the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall?" Jiao San asked Han Li.

"After what happened today, I've realized that I have too many grudges against the Heavenly Court. The sooner I join the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall, the sooner I'll have a powerful ally. But this time, don't just give me a title as a Wheel of Reincarnation Disciple," Han Li shook his head and said.

"Perhaps it's fate that you have a deep connection with our Wheel of Reincarnation Hall. This time, you've helped me greatly, and our Hall Master is also very fond of you. Who knows, maybe you'll even get to meet him in person," Jiao San smiled and said.

"That's great. But earlier, you mentioned something about the Golden Child. I'm still waiting for an explanation," Han Li said with a smile, and then asked in a transmission, "What's going on with the Golden Child?"

"This matter... is not convenient to discuss right now. I can only tell you that the Golden Child is currently imprisoned in the Nine Yuan Observatory," Jiao San hesitated for a moment before responding.

Han Li's expression changed slightly, and he asked in a transmission, "What's going on with the Golden Child being captured by the Nine Yuan Observatory? Can you at least tell me that?"
