High above the sky.

Feng Bai's face was solemn, his hands formed a seal, and he slapped his palm downwards towards the mountain peak.

The void instantly condensed into a layer of frost, transforming into a giant white palm print that landed on the mountain peak.

A loud "boom" echoed, and the hundred-meter-tall mountain peak exploded, disintegrating into countless snowflakes-like white crystal powder that dispersed into the air.

However, after the white crystal powder settled, the rumbling sound in the void grew louder, and a pair of giant crystal green hands emerged from the massive spatial rift, grasping the edges of the rift and pulling it apart.

A terrifying thunderous sound echoed, and the spatial rift was torn open like a layer of black fabric, transforming into a spatial passageway tens of thousands of miles wide.

Immediately, a giant head with short hair and a face like gold emerged from the passageway, scanning the surroundings before laughing loudly, "Ahah, I've finally found you!"

As he spoke, his enormous body flashed with light and suddenly shrunk back.

Behind him, a massive mountain cliff emerged from the spatial rift, slowly protruding into the air.

"Xuan Yuan Jie!"

Feng Bai's brow furrowed, his expression turning increasingly unsightly as he watched the mountain cliff slowly emerge from the spatial passageway, revealing its full extent.

It was a landmass tens of thousands of miles wide, covered in dense rows of tens of thousands of Tian Ting cultivators, each wearing armor and wielding weapons, exuding a fierce aura.

At the forefront of the mountain cliff stood a bare-chested man, Xuan Yuan Jie.

"Ahah, Antiao, Feng Bai... I remember there was someone named Qing Feng, where is he? You've been hiding for so many years, finally emerging?" Xuan Yuan Jie laughed, his voice booming.

"Xuan Yuan Jie, don't be arrogant, when our king returns to the Daozu's throne, it will be your downfall!" Antiao's brow furrowed, his voice loud and clear.

"Ha! When she was the Daozu, she couldn't even defeat me, what can she do now? Today, I'll eradicate all of you remnants, and it'll be a gift for the Bodhi banquet!" Xuan Yuan Jie's eyes narrowed, sizing up the golden light ball that was Jin Tong.

Feng Bai saw this and didn't respond, his body flashing as he descended towards the mountain cliff like a shooting star.

A blue light enveloped him, and a fierce wind blew, as countless fine silk threads mixed with snowflakes shot towards the mountain cliff.

In an instant, a snowstorm descended, covering the mountain cliff, and countless silk threads pierced towards Xuan Yuan Jie.

Without needing Xuan Yuan Jie's orders, a robust man wearing silver armor and wielding dual guns emerged from behind him, advancing to meet the attack.

His eyes flashed with silver light, and a layer of light spiritual domain enveloped him, conjuring a giant silver mirror that shielded him from the attack.

The snowstorm crashed against the silver mirror, and a dazzling silver light erupted, reflecting the attack back towards Feng Bai.

Antiao's eyes widened in concern as Feng Bai's figure was engulfed by the snowstorm.

The robust man's name was Yin Wu Shuang, Xuan Yuan Jie's subordinate and a Da Luo cultivator who had mastered the silver attribute law. His abilities were not to be underestimated.

However, just as the silver mirror was about to shatter, a layer of frost appeared on its surface, and it exploded with a crisp sound.

The shattered mirror released a burst of crystal powder, and silk threads condensed into a snow-white crystal spear that pierced towards Yin Wu Shuang's throat.

Yin Wu Shuang's eyes widened in surprise, and he wielded his dual guns to block the attack.

The snow-white crystal spear seemed to come from nowhere, but as Yin Wu Shuang countered, a figure emerged from the void - Feng Bai.

His mouth was stained with blue blood, and his chest was pierced by the silver gun.

"You're just this capable, and you dare..." Yin Wu Shuang sneered, his voice dripping with contempt.

However, before he could finish speaking, he saw that the silver gun had pierced Feng Bai's body, but it had no effect, as his body had transformed into countless silk threads.

Yin Wu Shuang's expression changed, and his silver gun flashed with light, releasing a metallic liquid that splashed onto Feng Bai's body.

The liquid solidified, binding Feng Bai in place.

"Break"

Feng Bai was unfazed, his hands forming a seal as he whispered a single word.

In the next instant, countless snow-white crystal threads burst forth from Yin Wu Shuang's silver armor, tearing his body apart and shattering it into countless fragments.
Shuangbai's body regained its freedom, and with a swift movement, the frost and snow outside his body surged violently, and a thousand-meter snow peak suddenly appeared within the spiritual realm, hurtling towards the mountain cliff.

As the snow peak fell, the snow on top of it collapsed, like a thousand soldiers charging into battle, engulfing Xuan Yuanjie.

Shuangbai was clear from the start that he was no match for Xuan Yuanjie. What he did was only to buy time for Jintong, and every moment he could delay Xuan Yuanjie was a moment gained.

On the other side, Yin Wushuang, who had just been torn apart, was reassembling himself into a pool of silver liquid.

"Trash," Xuan Yuanjie's companion, a blue-robed old man, muttered.

He took a step forward, and his sleeves unfolded, releasing a powerful gust of wind that attracted the snowstorm, drawing it into his sleeve.

In just a few breaths, the entire mountain peak was sucked into his sleeve, disappearing from view.

A loud rumbling sound shook the air!

On the giant scorpion's back, the golden orb suddenly shone brightly, and mysterious whirlpools began to appear on its surface, emitting a terrifying aura that threatened to devour the heavens.

Yin Wushuang's eyes lit up with excitement.

The heavenly cultivators on the cross-border continent felt the terrifying aura and were shocked, their faces filled with fear.

"We've reached this point, it's time to end it," Xuan Yuanjie said, his eyes locked onto the golden orb.

His voice had barely faded when a white light burst forth from the continent's center.

Shuangbai's figure had appeared silently, his hands slapping the ground, and his body transformed into a thousand threads of crystal, merging with the earth.

In an instant, a layer of frost spread out, encasing the entire continent in ice.

"We've succeeded..." Yin Wushuang exclaimed, his fist clenched.

But his joy was short-lived, as a sudden change occurred.

The earthy glow on the continent's surface began to fluctuate, and a powerful earth-attribute law burst forth, causing the rocks and soil to churn and surge like waves.

A flat area in the center of the continent suddenly rose into the air, and a giant hand made of rock grasped a white-haired man in blue armor, lifting him into the air.

"Shuangbai!" Yin Wushuang shouted.

The white-haired man was indeed Shuangbai, who was being held captive by the rock hand, his body bound by dark yellow chains imbued with earth-attribute law. The chains were as thick as a child's arm, but weighed as much as a mountain, rendering him immobile.

His own law force was also being suppressed, and the ice that had encased the continent began to melt.

"Leave it to us," a woman in a purple silk dress said, glancing at Yin Wushuang.

"Quick battle, quick decision," Xuan Yuanjie said, his expression unchanged.

"Understood," the three of them replied in unison, leading the heavenly cultivators in a charge like a tidal wave.

Yin Wushuang gazed at the distant heavenly demon cloud, his heart filled with anxiety. Xuan Yuanjie had taken control of Shuangbai, and Qingfeng was still trapped within the cloud.

"We'll fight to the end," Yin Wushuang said, his voice sharp.

The insects that formed the scorpion array began to stir, their bodies glowing with a fierce determination.

The insects outside the spatial rift, eager to join the battle, surged forward, disregarding the pressure of the external space.

The two armies clashed, their numbers surpassing the imagination, and the spatial rift was filled with the sound of war.

The insects, though numerous, were no match for the heavenly cultivators, who had a significant advantage in terms of level.

Yin Wushuang's two silver guns pierced through the air, killing tens of thousands of insects, while the blue-robed old man's sleeves absorbed millions more.

The woman in purple silk created a sea of flames, incinerating tens of millions of insects.

The three of them left the heavenly cultivators to fight the insects and charged towards the scorpion array, aiming to kill Jintong.

The battle raged on, with the outcome hanging in the balance.
