"Brother Han, what are we doing here?" Ziling asked after a long time, seeing Han Li still strolling around the city.

Han Li's appearance didn't seem to be that of someone who wanted to help others.

"The True Immortal Realm's spiritual energy is rich and abundant, and all the major immortal domains, big or small, are basically prosperous and thriving. But a place like this, so desolate and decrepit, is rarely seen. I want to experience the unique atmosphere of this place," Han Li said.

"What's there to experience in this kind of desolate atmosphere?" Ziling asked, gazing around at the desolate scenery, wrinkling her nose in distaste.

Han Li hesitated for a moment, but didn't say anything else, just shaking his head.

In fact, he had come here for a reason related to the "Wheel of Reincarnation" technique he had received earlier. Specifically, it was for cultivating the seventh layer.

The seventh layer of the "Wheel of Reincarnation" technique was much more complex than the previous six layers, requiring not only talent and determination but also experience with the complexities of human life. One had to understand the various mindsets of people, including those who were successful, those who failed, those who were wealthy, and those who were down on their luck. This was necessary to temper one's mind and allow one's spirit to reach a state of balance and harmony.

Over the years, Han Li had accompanied Ziling on her travels, partly to keep her company, but also to observe the complexities of human life.

After reaching the sixth layer of the "Wheel of Reincarnation" technique, Han Li was able to sense the thoughts and emotions of others through their spirit energy, just like the "Crying Soul" technique.

The people in this abandoned city were filled with a sense of despair, which was quite rare compared to other places. That's why Han Li had come here to experience it for himself.

Of course, he couldn't let Ziling know about this.

Ziling's eyes sparkled, and she didn't ask any more questions, following Han Li silently.

Han Li wandered around the abandoned city for a whole night, only opening his eyes when the sun began to rise.

"Are we done?" Ziling asked.

"I've kept you waiting for a whole night, I'm sorry," Han Li said with a nod.

"Never mind, but what do you plan to do next? Continue doing good deeds?" Ziling asked, shaking her head.

Han Li smiled ambiguously, his divine sense expanding.

Suddenly, he raised an eyebrow, and with a flick of his wrist, he activated the Thunder Array.

The two of them vanished from their original location and reappeared above a small courtyard in the city.

Inside the courtyard, seven or eight strong men were surrounding an old man, seemingly trying to rob him.

"Stop!" Han Li shouted, pointing his finger.

A bolt of lightning shot out from his hand, striking the ground nearby.

The sound of the explosion shook the ground, and the strong men were sent flying. Han Li had been trying to cultivate his benevolent spirit, and didn't dare to kill anyone, lest he upset the balance of his mind.

The strong men, seeing Han Li and Ziling standing in mid-air, were terrified and fled in all directions. The old man, after his initial shock, came over to thank them.

Han Li's brow furrowed, as his actions had helped the old man, but he hadn't felt any surge of benevolent energy.

He merely nodded at the old man, and then used the Thunder Array to leave, teleporting to another location.

In the blink of an eye, they had been in the abandoned city for half a month, and Han Li had done over a hundred good deeds, but the benevolent energy still hadn't appeared.

In a relatively clean tea house in the abandoned city, Han Li and Ziling sat facing each other.

Han Li had a cup of tea in front of him, with a misty aroma wafting from it, but his face was gloomy, and he hadn't taken a sip.

Ziling wasn't drinking tea either, but was flipping through a thick book.

The book was one that Han Li had obtained from the Wheel of Reincarnation's trading post, which explained the concept of good and evil. Ziling had been looking for a way to help Han Li solve his current problem.

It was mid-afternoon, but the tea house was empty, except for the two of them.

"Gentlemen, doesn't the tea meet your expectations? Would you like to change to a different kind?" a middle-aged man with a slender build asked, smiling.

This man was the owner of the tea house, but he was actually a cultivator in the Great Vehicle period, who had retired to this place and was running a mundane business.

His cultivation level was not low for this region, but in front of Han Li, he couldn't hide his identity.

"No need, the tea is fine, it's just that we have some troubles on our minds, and we're not in the mood to appreciate it. It's a waste of your craftsmanship," Han Li said with a gentle smile.
As he spoke, he picked up his teacup and took a sip, nodding slightly at the shopkeeper.

As for Ziling, he didn't pay attention to the shopkeeper and continued to read his book.

"Hehe, it seems like you two have some concerns, and drinking this tea with a light and floating aroma isn't suitable. I have just the thing, a Clear Mind Tea that you can try." The shopkeeper said to himself, not waiting for Han Li to respond, and turned to walk towards the inner room.

A moment later, he came out with two cups of emerald green tea and placed them in front of the two.

The emerald green tea was almost tasteless, like two cups of clear water.

Han Li's eyes lit up slightly, and he became a bit interested. He picked up the teacup and took a sip, and a refreshing tea flavor emerged from his tongue, then flowed into his body and spread out.

His frustrated emotions dissipated significantly as the tea flavor spread.

"Shopkeeper, your tea art is truly good." Han Li praised.

"Daoist friend, you're overpraising me. Looking at your appearance and aura, I think you're also cultivators, and not from Xiangyi?" The shopkeeper seemed to be a person who enjoyed making friends, and laughed as he spoke.

"Shopkeeper, you have good eyesight. We are indeed from outside, I am Han Li, and this is Ziling." Han Li's eyes flashed, and he didn't hide anything.

"Originally, it was Daoist friend Han Li, and Daoist friend Ziling. I am Li Hai." The shopkeeper clasped his hands together.

Ziling looked up from his book, glanced at the shopkeeper, and nodded slightly, before quickly becoming engrossed in his book again.

"Li Shopkeeper, since there's no one else in the shop, why don't you sit down and chat with us?" Han Li invited.

Li Hai didn't decline, and sat down beside them.

"Li Shopkeeper, how did you know that we two are from outside?" Han Li asked.

"Your daoist auras are active, like the rising sun, and full of energy. You're very different from the people of Xiangyi, and it's clear that you're from a more distant place. Anyone who has lived here for a long time can see it at a glance, it's not unusual." Li Hai laughed and said.

"Li Shopkeeper, you have a keen eye, I admire you. But is it true that every place is like this, with a gloomy atmosphere?" Han Li asked.

"It's a long story. The spiritual veins of this continent were dug up and exhausted tens of thousands of years ago, and the foundation was broken. The situation has been getting worse and worse, and those who could leave have left. The ones who remained are either unable to do anything or are attached to their homeland, and naturally, they have no energy to speak of." Li Hai sighed and said.

"I suppose it's not just this continent, right?" Han Li said.

"That's right, it seems that Daoist friend Han Li has indeed traveled to many places." The shopkeeper nodded.

"Li Shopkeeper, you're not from this land, or rather, you're not from this immortal realm, are you?" Han Li slowly nodded, and suddenly put down his teacup, smiling lightly.

"Oh, how did you know?" The shopkeeper's face showed a hint of surprise.

"Although I don't understand the Way of Tea, I've heard that the Green Water Immortal Realm, which is adjacent to the Crane Mountain Immortal Realm, is particularly skilled in brewing spiritual tea. The world's famous teas mostly come from there, and it's said that to improve the technique of brewing spiritual tea, some tea masters from the Green Water Immortal Realm created special techniques to aid in tea-making. Among them, the most widely spread is the 'Green Water Convergence Technique'... Li Shopkeeper, your water-attribute technique is very similar to the 'Green Water Convergence Technique' that I've heard of. And the layout of your tea shop, while it looks like the local style at first glance, still reveals some characteristics of the Green Water Immortal Realm. That's why I ventured to guess, am I correct?" Han Li smiled and asked.

"You're indeed perceptive! I am indeed from the Green Water Immortal Realm, and I've come from afar." Li Hai praised, and his eyes showed a hint of reverence.

He had initially thought that Han Li and Ziling were just using some technique to conceal their auras, but now it seemed that they were able to travel freely between immortal realms and could see through his technique. His cultivation level was at least that of a True Immortal, or perhaps even a Golden Immortal. Naturally, he couldn't help but feel a sense of respect.

But he also saw that Han Li didn't intend to reveal his identity, so he didn't ask any more questions.

"Li Shopkeeper, your tea-making skills are quite good. Why did you leave the Green Water Immortal Realm, which is rich in resources, and come to the desolate Crane Mountain Immortal Realm?" Han Li asked curiously.

"Daoist friend, you're overpraising me. My tea-making skills, combined with my slow cultivation progress, made me a low-ranking member of the Green Water Immortal Realm. I, Li Hai, had tried my best in the past, but unfortunately, I was unable to break through the bottleneck... Ah, I don't want to bring up the past. Now, I just want to live a peaceful life, without worrying about my future, and that's enough for me." Li Hai smiled bitterly and said.

Han Li looked at the shopkeeper, sensing his emotional fluctuations, and nodded silently.

"Let's not talk about me. You two must have come here for something, right? I've been here for many years, and although my cultivation level is not high, I'm familiar with the situation in various places. Perhaps I can help you." Li Hai looked at Han Li and asked.

"Thank you, Li Shopkeeper, for your kind intentions. But the thing I want to do is a bit special, and outsiders can't help." Han Li shook his head.

"In that case, I can only wish you good luck, Daoist friend Han Li. If you need my help, just let me know." Li Hai patted his chest and said.

"Thank you." Han Li could sense that Li Hai's words were sincere, and he clasped his hands together in gratitude.

"Is Li Uncle here?" At this moment, a voice came from outside the shop, and it was a sturdy-looking young man.

The young man was a mortal, and his clothes were tattered. He stood outside the tea shop, not daring to enter.

"Daoist friend Han Li, Ziling, please stay and rest for a while. I'll go and attend to this." Li Hai glanced outside, and bid farewell to Han Li before getting up and walking out.

Han Li picked up the Clear Mind Tea and took a sip, then turned to look outside the tea shop casually.
