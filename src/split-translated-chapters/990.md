"It's not very convenient to talk here, let's go back underground first." Crab Daoist glanced around, his eyes seeming to flash, and waved his hand.

Han Li suddenly felt his body enveloped by a gentle force, and in the blink of an eye, he appeared in the underground palace.

The other golden "Crab Daoist" in the crystal coffin had also awakened at this moment and was standing aside with his hands down.

Not only that, but there were also two human-shaped puppets standing beside him.

These two puppets also looked exactly like the Crab Daoist, except that one was completely black and the other was pure white.

The black puppet looked at the Crab Daoist with fierce light flashing in his eyes, as if he wanted to choose someone to devour. His expression was indescribably grim.

The white puppet, however, was gentle and solemn, with a warm smile always on his face, making people feel at ease when they looked at him.

Han Li was slightly startled when he saw this scene and looked towards the Crab Daoist.

However, the three puppets did not pay attention to Han Li, and their eyes were all focused on the Crab Daoist.

The golden puppet did not speak, a hint of strangeness flashed in his eyes, and then he looked away.

"Hmph! This time, you were lucky to survive the Heavenly Tribulation, but don't be too proud. Sooner or later, I will kill you and take your place!" The black puppet sneered coldly.

"Congratulations, fellow Daoist, you have finally attained the Great Dao. You summoned us here, do you have something to instruct us to do?" The white puppet looked exactly the same, but his expression was completely different. He said with a gentle smile.

"There are indeed some things that I need the three of you to do. Black Spirit fellow Daoist, please go to the Puppet City and inform Sha Xin that I have come out of seclusion, so that she can make preparations." The Crab Daoist instructed the black puppet.

Although the black puppet was unwilling, he still turned around and left without saying a word.

"White Spirit fellow Daoist, please go and remove the spatial restrictions around the Great Ruins, and then bring all the people from the Puppet City here." The Crab Daoist said to the white puppet.

The white puppet agreed and also turned to leave.

"As for the Golden Spirit fellow Daoist, you go and prepare. Later, I will activate the power of the Jilin Empty Realm's origin at the right time and open a spatial passage connecting to the outside world." The Crab Daoist said to the golden puppet.

The golden puppet nodded and also left the palace.

Han Li watched as the three puppets left one by one, with a pensive expression on his face.

"Fellow Daoist Han seems to be very curious about these three puppets." The Crab Daoist sat down on a chair next to the palace and had Han Li sit down beside him, saying calmly.

"Yes, I am. These three puppets seem to have complete spiritual intelligence. I wonder what kind of puppets they are?" Han Li nodded and asked.

"With your experience and knowledge, Fellow Daoist Han, I'm afraid you already have some idea. Why don't you tell me what you think?" The Crab Daoist said with a faint smile.

"It seems that I really can't hide anything from Fellow Daoist Crab. These three puppets, could they be related to the three corpses you cut out?" Han Li's eyebrows twitched, and a smile appeared on his face as he spoke.

"Haha, Fellow Daoist Han is right. I really did seal the three corpses I cut out into these three puppet bodies." The Crab Daoist laughed heartily.

"I've heard that cultivators above the Daluo stage have a lot of trouble dealing with the three corpses they cut out. The three corpses cannot be killed, as killing them will cause some harm to the main body. But keeping them by your side, those three corpses may backlash at any time. That's why the immortals in the Heavenly Court would try every means to seal them in the Gray Realm. It's amazing that Fellow Daoist Crab can seal the three corpses into puppets and keep them by your side to make use of them!" Han Li said in surprise.

"Fellow Daoist Han, you are right. The three corpses are indeed difficult to deal with. Most Daluo or Dao Ancestors will seal the three corpses they cut out. I dare to keep them by my side because I cultivate the Puppet Laws, which specialize in control. That's why I'm confident enough to keep them by my side." The Crab Daoist said.

Han Li nodded silently, feeling that he had gained a lot.

Such experiences beyond the Daluo stage were not something that could be heard casually.

"Fellow Daoist Crab, let's get back to the point. What were you talking about just now?" He then asked again.
"This matter is not urgent, Fellow Daoist Han, listen to what I have to say first. My identity, as you guessed, is indeed related to the Night Sun Dynasty. To be precise, I am the younger brother of the current Holy Emperor Shi Kongyu, and also the uncle of Shi Chuankong." Daoist Xie said slowly.

Although Han Li had guessed that Daoist Xie had a significant relationship with the Night Sun Dynasty, he didn't expect it to be like this, and he was secretly shocked.

"Daoist Xie, since you are the brother of the Demon Lord, why are you in this Jilei Empty Realm? Moreover, from what Ahuai and the Sand Heart City Lord said before, it seems that you are currently enemies?" He carefully chose his words and asked.

"The story behind this is long. It dates back to when the two of us were fighting for the position of Holy Emperor. I won't go into the details, but in the end, he won, and I lost. The space laws I had bitterly cultivated in my body were even extracted by him. Fortunately, I still had some skills, and with the help of others, I managed to narrowly escape from Shi Kongyu's hands and hide in this Jilei Empty Realm." Daoist Xie said calmly.

Han Li's expression didn't change, but he was shocked by the revelation.

Daoist Xie's explanation was simple, but the battle back then must have been extremely intense. Moreover, Daoist Xie's statement that "the space laws in his body were extracted" left Han Li utterly astonished.

However, it seemed that this matter was related to the secrets of the Night Sun Dynasty, so he didn't ask further.

"I see. But Shi Kongyu wouldn't just let you go, right?" Han Li nodded and then said.

"Of course not. Shi Kongyu appears to be elegant and magnanimous, but in reality, he seeks revenge for the slightest grievance. He naturally wants to cut the grass and eliminate the roots. However, Jilei Empty Realm is a special space that has existed in the Dao Domain since ancient times. The cultivation of those who enter here will be completely suppressed, and those with magic power and cultivation above the Great Luo Realm simply cannot set foot here. Shi Kongyu cannot enter this place, so I was able to save my life." Daoist Xie nodded and said.

"Great Luo Realm cultivators cannot enter this Jilei Empty Realm... Could it be that someone has set up restrictions here? But are there really restrictions that can limit Shi Kongyu?" Han Li frowned and said, feeling a bit incredulous.

"Jilei Empty Realm was opened up by an ancient Dao Ancestor. That senior set up this strict rule in this space. It is precisely because this rule is too harsh and destroys the balance of the heaven and earth laws here that this place is so desolate." Daoist Xie explained.

"Oh, there is such a thing." Han Li was stunned when he heard this, and then he looked around, a hint of shock flashing in his eyes.

He had now cultivated laws more deeply, but he could only influence a certain range around him with the laws, and everything would return to normal after retracting the laws.

That ancient Dao Ancestor could actually affect the entire Jilei Empty Realm with his own laws, and it remained unchanged for hundreds of millions of years. Han Li truly could not reach this level at his current stage.

"Fellow Daoist Han, your cultivation has not reached this level, so you don't quite understand these matters. But with your aptitude, I believe you will reach this level soon." Daoist Xie seemed to smile.

"I hope it will be as Daoist Xie says. Since there are such rules here, how could you enter this place, and even break through to the Dao Ancestor realm here?" Han Li changed the subject and asked.

"Back then, Shi Kongyu extracted the laws from my body, causing my cultivation to plummet and fall to the Taiyi Realm, which allowed me to enter here. Moreover, after coming here, I was fortunate enough to obtain the Dao inheritance left behind by that ancient Dao Ancestor, making me half the master of this Jilei Empty Realm, so I was not restricted by the rules here." Daoist Xie explained.

"I see. Then what happened next? How did you become a puppet and end up in the lower realm?" Han Li suddenly realized and asked.

"Staying here, my cultivation of space laws had reached a dead end, so I switched to cultivating another profound law, the puppet laws, which was also the law that ancient Dao Ancestor cultivated. I had a good aptitude for the puppet laws, and with the help of that senior Dao Ancestor's Dao inheritance, I finally reached the Great Luo Realm, and then I even killed two more corpses, reaching the peak of the Great Luo Realm. However, when I was killing the last corpse, I was betrayed by Ahuai, and Shi Kongyu intervened, causing my efforts to fail at the last moment, and my physical body even perished. With no other choice, I had to seal my soul's memories into a puppet, which was that golden crab, and throw it into the lower realm to prepare for a comeback in the future. You should know the rest of the story, Fellow Daoist Han, so I won't explain everything." Daoist Xie sighed and continued.

"What is the favor you mentioned earlier that you need my help with?" Han Li listened and slowly nodded.

"Although I have now achieved the position of Dao Ancestor, if I were to fight against Shi Kongyu, I would still likely lose. To avenge the past, I need to find external help." Daoist Xie looked at Han Li and said.

"Daoist Xie, do you want to join forces with me to fight against Shi Kongyu?" Han Li's eyebrows raised, and he said in surprise.

"Yes." Daoist Xie nodded with a smile.

"Daoist Xie thinks too highly of me. I may have some skills, but I am just a minor cultivator at the Taiyi Realm. Compared to Shi Kongyu, there is an unimaginable gap. How could I possibly help you?" Han Li laughed.

"There's no need to belittle yourself, Fellow Daoist Han. In the short term, you indeed pose no threat to Shi Kongyu, but with your aptitude and fortune, you will reach our level one day. Moreover, with so many mysterious cavities opened in your body now, once you leave here, your strength will soar. I believe that day is not far off." Daoist Xie said with a smile.

Han Li's heart stirred when he heard this. It turned out that Daoist Xie had been tirelessly helping him improve his physical cultivation for this reason.

However, although he and Daoist Xie were friends, their previous agreement had been fulfilled. Now, rushing into a struggle between two Dao Ancestor-level powers could easily result in being reduced to dust.

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but show a hesitant expression.

"Fellow Daoist Han, rest assured. I'm not asking you to stay here now. I just hope that when your strength is sufficient in the future, you can come back and lend me a hand. Moreover, I, Shi, will not let you participate in my struggle with Shi Kongyu for nothing. Consider this item a small token of interest for today's agreement." Daoist Xie took out a jade bottle and handed it over.
