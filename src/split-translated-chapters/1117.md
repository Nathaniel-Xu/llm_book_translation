As the two massive golden swords clashed, a deafening explosion shook the void!

The white sword was blocked, but Han Li was sent flying backward, spitting out a mouthful of blood, his breath ragged.

His Time Law power was being severely suppressed by the Years God Lamp, and it was clear that he was still unable to face the attacks of the Great Luo existence head-on.

However, Dao Yin's eyes flickered with shock, clearly not expecting that his own fusion of law power would not be able to kill the young cultivator at the peak of the Taiyi Realm.

What surprised him even more was the endless array of methods that Han Li possessed.

Jiao San did not pay attention to the battle here, her body flashing like lightning as she charged towards the Five-Color Altar. In the blink of an eye, she arrived in front of the altar.

However, the altar was currently covered by a layer of flames formed by the Years God Lamp.

She muttered to herself, raising her hands.

A dark red crystal thread shot out from her body, weaving and entwining in front of her, as the dark red light in the surrounding spiritual domain rapidly gathered.

As the dark red crystal threads increased, Jiao San's face grew paler, her breath becoming unstable, as if her entire body's energy was being drained away.

Her eyes, however, shone with a determined light, her chanting speed increasing once more.

The void shook violently, as the dense dark red crystal threads wove together, a massive dark red circular shadow appeared.

The surface of the circular shadow was arranged with six black circular holes, in the shape of a hexagonal plum blossom, embedded with black light that swirled and rotated.

A strange and indescribable power emanated from the circular shadow, causing the stable void to tremble.

Jiao San let out a loud cry, her hands sweeping forward, as the dark red circular shadow shot out, rotating rapidly, and crashed into the golden flames.

A loud hissing sound erupted!

The golden flames trembled violently, as tongues of fire shot out from within, wrapping around the dark red circular shadow, but were immediately extinguished by the black light.

Dao Yin's heart was filled with urgency, his hands changing the spell, as he no longer bothered to kill Han Li, but instead cast several spells into the golden flames, making them burn even brighter.

Jiao San spat out a mouthful of blood, her body suddenly becoming limp and weak.

But the dense blood mist that erupted from her body was immediately absorbed by the dark red circular shadow, causing its rotation speed to increase rapidly, as a massive black light, accompanied by an invisible force, pressed down on the flames.

The surface of the flames was covered by the black light, and with a loud "whoosh", the flames exploded, scattering in all directions.

"Wheel of Rebirth!"

Dao Yin's eyes widened in shock.

He had never expected that the two Taiyi Realm cultivators before him would be cultivating the same three great supreme laws, Time Law and Wheel of Rebirth, and that their attainments would not be inferior to those of the Great Luo Realm cultivators.

Alas, all of this happened in the blink of an eye, and Lei Yu and the others were struggling to maintain the grand array, unable to lend a hand.

"Han Dao friend, now is the time, act quickly!" Jiao San shouted.

At this moment, she was as pale as paper, her body half-kneeling on the ground, the dark red circular shadow's rotation slowing down, on the verge of collapse.

Jiao San's words had barely left her lips when Han Li's body transformed into a flash of light, shooting out from the flames and piercing through the void.

However, he did not charge towards the altar, but instead towards the Years God Lamp on the altar.

"Han Dao friend, what are you doing?" Jiao San cried out in shock.

Han Li's eyes were filled with a crazed light, his pupils reflecting the image of the Years God Lamp, as if his eyes could no longer contain anything else.

"You're seeking death!" Dao Yin's eyes blazed with anger, as he shouted.

His voice was followed by a burst of energy, as he pointed a single hand at the Years God Lamp, and a golden tongue of flame shot out from his mouth, striking the lamp.

The Years God Lamp trembled violently, the oil within boiling over, as a wave of flames shot out, engulfing Han Li.

Han Li, however, seemed completely unaware, his desire having consumed his rationality, his face twisted in a crazed expression, as he activated the Five Elements Fantastical World technique to its limits.

The five Time Law objects appeared around him, forming a golden spherical barrier that enveloped him, as he charged into the flames.

As he entered the heart of the flames, the surroundings erupted in a cacophony of sound, the five Time Law objects being compressed by the flames, pressing in on him from all sides, as the golden barrier around him began to thin.

Han Li, however, gritted his teeth, his determination unwavering.

At this moment, he was identical to the previous Qi Mo, or perhaps even surpassed him.
Only a few breaths later, the five Time Law objects finally couldn't withstand the flames, and the light screen they condensed was completely melted, leaving Han Li's body directly exposed to the flames.

A severe burning sensation arose, causing Han Li's eyebrows to furrow, and the light in his eyes dimmed slightly. However, he soon let out a cold snort, and his expression became resolute once more.

He saw his hand emerge from the flames, grasping the lamp post of the Years God Lamp, and prepare to pull it outward.

The flames on the lamp suddenly condensed into a single stream, like a dragon, and climbed up Han Li's arm, instantly engulfing his entire arm and half of his body.

In the intense flames, Han Li could clearly see the fabric of his robe, skin, and muscles on his arm melting away, leaving only his bones, which were also gradually turning black from the intense heat.

The unbearable pain was not something he couldn't feel, but at this moment, there was a voice in his mind, constantly comforting him:

"Just endure a little longer, and you'll get it... As long as you get the lamp, everything will be worth it..."

"Almost there, just a little more effort..."

"Get it, get it..."

Han Li's expression was dazed, and he muttered to himself: "Get it..."

As he spoke, his Heaven's Wrath Prison technique automatically activated, and all the true spirit blood vessels in his body began to boil, regardless of whether it would cause blood vessel backlash.

At this moment, he wanted to use all his strength to get the lamp.

Dao Yin True Person's hair stood on end, and his dao robe puffed out as he rushed towards the lamp, his body leaving a trail of afterimages.

Biao San, however, seemed to have mustered up some strength, and once again urged the magic seal, causing the dark red wheel to spin rapidly and fly towards the five-colored altar.

"Not good!" Dao Yin True Person cried out in alarm, but it was too late to turn back.

The altar emitted a five-colored light, attempting to resist the dark red wheel, but unfortunately, its power was limited, and it was easily crushed.

Accompanied by a loud explosion, a large hole appeared on the altar, revealing a dark and seemingly bottomless pit.

Almost simultaneously, Han Li's spiritual sea began to operate, and a bright, snowy lightning bolt appeared in his mind, clearing his spiritual platform.

"Brother Han!" a voice shouted, piercing his ears.

Han Li turned around, and saw Lei Yuze shouting at him: "You truly don't care about the lives of the Golden Source Realm's inhabitants, and for the sake of personal gain, you're willing to release that demon? The altar has been broken, and if you take the lamp, the demon will have no restraints!"

Demon? Personal gain? Inhabitants?

Han Li felt as if he had been struck by lightning, and his mind suddenly cleared. He looked at his situation and realized his mistake.

He quickly released his hand, which had almost turned into a dry bone, and retreated, but the flames that had engulfed his arm refused to let go, continuing to cling to him.

Han Li's mind moved, and he quickly took out the green gourd from his waist, tapped the bottom, and a green whirlpool appeared, sucking in the flames on his arm.

The flames entered the gourd, and its originally green skin was instantly burned red, taking a long time to recover.

Han Li hung the gourd back on his waist, looked at his charred arm, and felt a chill run down his spine, instantly drenched in cold sweat.

"What's wrong with me? Has someone controlled my mind?" he muttered to himself.

No, the problem wasn't here, but rather had been hidden long ago.

Han Li's mind quickly recalled the events since entering the Years Tower, and he was shocked to discover some clues.

He was certain that he hadn't been controlled, but rather, his desire had been subtly amplified throughout his journey, and he had been unaware of it.

Moreover, it seemed that everyone who had entered the Years Tower had been influenced by some kind of power, and their desires had been guided, growing larger and larger.

That's why they had been destroying the altar, collecting treasures, and ultimately aiming for the Years God Lamp. Anyone who had a desire for it would be guided to compete for it.

Han Li, now awakened, looked at the large hole on the altar, and his eyes narrowed.

As soon as the hole appeared, a "sizzling" sound came from within, and a thick, black smoke emerged, like a dragon's tail, and rose into the air, filling the entire hall with a dark, rolling mist.

Han Li's arm displayed the shadow of the Dongyi divine tree, and his muscles and skin began to repair themselves at a visible rate, but there were still hidden injuries that wouldn't heal in a short time.

He hovered in mid-air, his eyes shining with a purple light as he operated the Nine Underworld Demon Eye, gazing into the hole on the altar.

The darkness within seemed to be stirring, and a low, ominous voice whispered: "The Years God Lamp... will soon be mine..."
