At that moment, the light of the Bodhi Fruit had not yet dissipated, but the brilliant lights on the bodies of many cultivators had already begun to flicker and shine.

The entire hall was plunged into an atmosphere that was difficult to describe.

"Hehe, it seems that there are indeed those who can break through..." The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth gazed at a young man sitting in a position that was quite far back.

The young man, who had followed his family's elderly ancestor to this place, had unexpectedly obtained a Bodhi Fruit. His body was now radiating a bright blue light, and his aura was rapidly increasing. His cultivation had broken through the middle stage of the Golden Immortal realm and entered the later stage.

Just as the commotion was dying down, another voice rang out, and it was discovered that seven or eight people had broken through their cultivation realms one after another.

The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth casually swept his gaze across the room and found that most of the cultivators who had broken through were below the Taiyi realm. After all, the higher one's cultivation, the more difficult it was to break through.

However, from the faces of the Taiyi cultivators, it could be seen that they were also filled with excitement. It was clear that they had received a great benefit, and although they had not broken through, they would certainly have fewer hidden dangers in their future cultivation.

Although the Bodhi Fruits consumed by the Daluo cultivators were generally of a higher grade, they were limited by their own high cultivation realms. If they had any bottlenecks, they would be major obstacles on their cultivation path, and it would be difficult to achieve immediate results.

However, there were also many benefits to be gained. The Daluo cultivators were often calm and composed, and even if they had gained a great deal, they would not easily reveal their emotions.

This continued for a long time, and the commotion in the hall gradually subsided.

"This banquet has allowed us to see all the fellow cultivators seize the opportunity, and it's a wonderful sight. It's not in vain that the Heavenly Court has put its heart into this." Guo Jin smiled and looked around at the crowd.

"It's all thanks to the Heavenly Venerable's kindness in bestowing the Bodhi Fruit upon us. We are grateful and offer our thanks to the Heavenly Venerable." A young man wearing a white robe, who had just broken through a realm, stood up and bowed deeply towards the Heavenly Venerable.

The other cultivators who had received the Bodhi Fruit, as well as many of the Daluo cultivators, also stood up and thanked the Heavenly Court.

The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth looked at this scene, and a smile appeared in his eyes. He muttered to himself, "The Heavenly Court is indeed extraordinary. A single Bodhi Fruit can attract so many followers. It's truly enviable..."

His voice was not loud, and he did not intentionally use his magic to amplify it. However, the cultivators present were all of high cultivation, and many of them were already paying attention to him. Therefore, as soon as he spoke, all eyes turned to him.

Except for a few people who looked indifferent, most of the cultivators looked displeased, frowning or showing anger.

"Hmph! The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth has always been opposed to the Heavenly Court and has disrupted the natural order. He has created chaos in the True Immortal realm. How dare he speak so boldly in front of the Heavenly Venerable?" An old man with a white beard stood up, his face red with rage.

The other cultivators followed his lead, criticizing the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth for his actions.

The hall was suddenly filled with the sound of chattering, like a flock of birds, and it was quite chaotic.

Guo Jin, however, did not show any anger. He continued to smile and raised his hand to calm the crowd, and soon the hall returned to silence.

"Everyone, please do not be like this. The old grievances between the Heavenly Court and the Wheel of Rebirth have been entangled for countless years. It's difficult to say who was right or wrong in the past. The reason we invited the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth to this banquet was not to engage in verbal sparring, but to seek a way to put an end to the conflict." Guo Jin spoke, his voice calm and gentle.

The cultivators nodded in agreement, praising Guo Jin for his wisdom and fairness. They felt that he was indeed the master of the Heavenly Court, and his words were a reflection of his noble character.

"Ha! A way to put an end to the conflict? I'm afraid that in this world, there is no one else who can speak such words with a straight face. It's truly a wonder to behold." The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth laughed loudly.

"Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth, are you questioning my sincerity? I have already shown my goodwill by allowing you to enter this hall safely, without sending troops to suppress the rebellious forces of the Wheel of Rebirth outside the Heavenly Gate. If you are willing to put an end to the conflict and stop the fighting, we can become friends and put the past behind us." Guo Jin raised an eyebrow, his voice calm and measured.

When the cultivators heard this, their faces changed, and many of them showed a flash of anger in their eyes.

"Heavenly Venerable, do you want to make friends with such a treacherous person? Do you want to forget the grievances between us and the Wheel of Rebirth? What about the loyal ministers and heroes who were killed by the Wheel of Rebirth for the sake of the Heavenly Court? How can we just forget about them?" Cangwu Zhenjun stood up, his voice filled with indignation.

"Cangwu, the cycle of revenge and hatred will never end. How can we put an end to it? In the past, the Heavenly Court has lost many people, and the Wheel of Rebirth has also suffered greatly. If we don't put an end to this cycle of hatred, who knows how many more loyal ministers and heroes will die in the future?" Guo Jin looked at him deeply, his voice filled with emotion.

"Haha... I see. Since the Heavenly Court doesn't want to seek revenge, I, Cangwu, will take care of it myself after I leave this place." Cangwu Zhenjun's face was filled with a sad smile, and he laughed loudly.

"It seems that the Heavenly Court is not entirely composed of useless yes-men. There are still some with backbone." The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth looked at him with a hint of admiration in his eyes.

"Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth, the Heavenly Court's sincerity is already evident. Are you truly unwilling to accept our offer of reconciliation?" Guo Jin frowned, his voice laced with a hint of disappointment.

"Reconciliation? Haha... I have a proposal. Please, Guo Jin, take a look at my true face, and then decide whether to reconcile or not." The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth laughed maniacally, and with a wave of his hand, he removed the hat that had been covering his face.
The face of the young man was quite ordinary, not matching the guesses of the crowd, which had ranged from a refined and elegant appearance to a cruel and ugly one.

The body of the Time Ancestor trembled slightly, and a look of incredulity flashed in his eyes.

The other Ancestors present also changed color, with the Master of the Nine Yuan Observatory, Li Yuanji, being the most shocked.

"Han Li?" Li Yuanji's body leaned forward slightly, and he couldn't help but call out the name.

The name was no longer unfamiliar to most of the people present.

At first, it was only mentioned sporadically, sometimes involving people from the Heavenly Court, sometimes involving the demonic and magical tribes, and sometimes seeming to come from rumors from the Heavenly Court's inspectors.

However, it was the incident where Han Li single-handedly killed his way into the Golden Origin Heavenly Palace, completely disregarding the Heavenly Court's authority, that really drew the attention of the entire Heavenly Court.

Later, the name Han Li was again mentioned as the one who defeated the Ancestor Feng Qingshui.

As for his subsequent killing of the Seventh King, Xuan Yuanjie, it was not widely known due to the timing of the Bodhi Banquet, and even those who heard the rumors did not necessarily believe them.

Even if Han Li's experiences were extraordinary, it was still unbelievable that a Mahayana cultivator could kill one of the Seventh Kings.

"How could it be? The Master of the Reincarnation Palace is actually that Han Li?"

"He's actually Han Li? He looks very ordinary..."

"This... doesn't make sense, the timing seems off..." A Mahayana cultivator who had interacted with the Reincarnation Palace for many years muttered.

"Han Li, isn't he a Time Law cultivator? What's going on here?"

"Could it be that the Seventh King Xuan Yuanjie was really killed by the Reincarnation Palace?"

...

The entire gathering at the Jade Pool was in an uproar, with various guesses and speculations about the Master of the Reincarnation Palace and Han Li. The discussions were even more heated than before.

Combining past rumors and the influence of the Reincarnation Palace, the many top cultivators present were all confused by the name "Han Li", and it was the name that was mentioned the most in their conversations.

Yu Menghan, who was sitting behind Meng Po, was shocked to the core. When she saw the face of the Master of the Reincarnation Palace, she almost stood up, but was fortunately held back by her master.

"Girl, don't move," Meng Po transmitted secretly.

Yu Menghan didn't know why she had suddenly lost her composure, but she suspected it had something to do with the 《Five Thunder True Mantra》.

However, she quickly calmed down and carefully examined the Master of the Reincarnation Palace, muttering to herself:

"It's not him..."

Her voice was weak and barely audible, and no one noticed.

"No wonder Old Ancestor Chen Gong asked so many questions, but the results were all unclear. It turns out that the cycle of cause and effect had already been disrupted. No wonder, no wonder..." Guo Heng seemed to have finally understood the mysteries of the past, and let out a sigh of relief.

"Looks like you've figured it out, Guo friend," the Master of the Reincarnation Palace raised an eyebrow and asked.

"Perhaps I wasn't clear before, but now that I've understood the mysteries of the Heavenly Divination, combined with what I've seen and heard, I have a rough idea. So, you're Han Li, and Han Li is also you?" Guo Heng nodded and said something that few people could understand.

"You once said 'the Great Way is solitary, how can it be coveted?' and tried to kill me, causing me to lose my Dao companion, and forcing me to flee in desperation. I only managed to survive by chance, and then I crossed through time and space to become the Master of the Reincarnation Palace. Do you think this grudge can be erased with a smile?" The Master of the Reincarnation Palace didn't respond to Guo Heng, but instead changed the subject.

The Time Law? Crossing through time and space? The more the crowd listened, the more confused they became, and the more shocked they felt.

Only Li Yuanji's expression changed, his brow furrowing before he shook his head, as if he had guessed something.

He knew that it was impossible for one person to cultivate two different Supreme Laws. This Master of the Reincarnation Palace, who was skilled in the Reincarnation Law, was the same person as Han Li, who cultivated the Time Law, and yet was not the same person.

So, who was the one who had originally transmitted the Law to him?
