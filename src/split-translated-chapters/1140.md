Han Li, the situation is not good, we should leave here quickly." Lanyan's voice echoed in Han Li's mind, her eyes scanning the surroundings.

Han Li had set up a powerful seal in her mind, if Han Li was killed, she would not survive either.

Han Li saw everything, and immediately felt the urge to leave the Golden Spring City, but the next moment he remembered that the Cross-Domain Transmission Array was closed, and the investigation he had sensed in front of the Golden Tower. His anxious and heavy heart suddenly became calm, and his thoughts became clearer than ever.

"You don't need to panic, just pretend nothing happened." Han Li's voice echoed in Lanyan's mind, his face completely calm, with a hint of a smile as he gazed at the Task Stone Wall, his expression even showing excitement like the people around him.

Lanyan looked at Han Li's changing expression, slightly startled, but for some reason, she felt that Han Li's words had a calming effect, and her expression also unconsciously returned to calm.

Han Li walked around the Task Stone Wall and the Exterminating Gods List, looking at it with many onlookers.

He and Lanyan were both wearing masks from the Reincarnation Hall, disguising their true appearances. Even if the opponent was a Great Luo existence, as long as they didn't investigate carefully, it would be difficult to discover their true identities.

Just now, their expressions had changed for only a moment, and then immediately calmed down. If no one was closely watching them, it would be impossible to notice anything unusual.

Moreover, they had just arrived in the Golden Spring City, and hadn't done anything to attract attention. The small crack just now should have gone unnoticed.

However, Han Li didn't expect that at this moment, in the depths of the crowd, a pair of eyes was staring at them, which was the round-faced middle-aged man from the Golden Tower.

"These two people are indeed suspicious, the man didn't react to the investigation of the Turning Wheel Pearl, but his divine sense still showed a slight fluctuation. Although it can deceive others, it can't deceive my Soul-Searching Eyes. Unfortunately, I arrived a step too late, and couldn't see their complete reaction to the Exterminating Gods List. If I had, my judgment would have been more certain." The round-faced middle-aged man's eyes showed a peculiar, dim glow, staring at Han Li and Lanyan.

Han Li walked around the Task Stone Wall for a while, then nodded to Lanyan, and mixed in with the crowd, quietly leaving.

Outside the Task Stone Wall, the two immediately flew towards a distant exit.

A figure also walked out of the Task Stone Wall, gazing at the two people's backs, which was the round-faced middle-aged man.

"They're leaving, it seems these two are indeed suspicious. Should I notify those people? No, just finding a suspect won't get me much reward. Lin'er's divine orifices are naturally withered, and I need a large amount of divine yuan stones to cure her. I must first confirm this person's identity, and make sure it's absolutely safe, before reporting it!" The round-faced middle-aged man flipped his hand, taking out a purple, round bead, his face changing, and then putting the bead away, his body turning into a faint, black shadow, chasing after Han Li and Lanyan.

Han Li and Lanyan quickly arrived at an exit of the Golden Spring City, paid the exit fee, and flew out of the city.

"Ah..." Han Li secretly let out a sigh of relief, his heart slowly calming down.

"Let's go!" He waved his hand, releasing a stream of blue light that enveloped the two of them, flying towards the distance.

This was the Golden Spring City, and the Ink Dragon Flying Boat was obtained from She Chan's storage artifact. Although the chances of being recognized were small, he didn't dare to take the risk.

With Han Li's speed, they flew out of the city's range in an instant, and only then did he slow down, finally stopping.

"Han Daoist, this place isn't safe enough, why didn't you leave?" Lanyan asked in surprise.

"Of course, we'll leave, but there's something to take care of first." Han Li smiled slightly.

He had barely finished speaking when he suddenly turned around, charging towards a small hill in the distance, his hand grasping at the air.

"Boom!" A loud explosion sounded!

The hill's surface fluctuated, and a small mountain-sized, golden giant palm appeared, grasping the hill.

The hill immediately collapsed, like tofu, and the ground was dug out into a massive, hundred-meter deep pit.

At this moment, a black figure shot out of the pit, fleeing towards the distance, which was the round-faced middle-aged man.

This person's aura was completely exposed, and he was a Taiyi realm cultivator, but only at the early stage.

"You still want to run? You've been following us for so long, did you think I didn't notice?" Han Li coldly snorted, his arm moving.

The golden giant palm disappeared, and then reappeared in front of the black figure, its five fingers closing in a flash, trapping the figure.

The round-faced middle-aged man's body exploded with a loud bang, but instead of blood and flesh flying everywhere, he transformed into hundreds of black lights, shooting out in all directions at extreme speeds.

Han Li's eyebrows rose, and he couldn't sense the opponent's true body, as if he had truly transformed into countless bodies, hiding in each black light.

However, he didn't panic, and instead, he single-handedly made a seal.

A golden light flashed, and the True Word Treasure Wheel appeared behind him, its golden ripples rapidly expanding, instantly covering the surrounding area, trapping all the black lights.

The black lights, trapped by the golden ripples, stopped moving, frozen in place.

After more than a decade, his time law had fully recovered, and seemed to have strengthened a bit.

Han Li then waved his sleeve, releasing countless golden lightning bolts, forming a lightning cage that trapped all the black lights.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he began to chant a spell, his voice echoing through the air, as he prepared to deal with the black lights.
"Destroy!" He flashed a cold glint in his eyes and snapped his fingers in the air.

The lightning cage suddenly burst forth with a brilliant light, then exploded with a deafening crash, as if a sun had burst, instantly extinguishing all the dark light.

A faint, mournful cry echoed from the lightning, only to be drowned out immediately.

Having finished, Han Li let out a sigh of relief.

That person's law should be a type of shadow law, which was naturally restrained by his lightning law, and coupled with the True Words Treasure Wheel, the opponent had no chance of escape.

Han Li retracted the True Words Treasure Wheel, and the golden ripples and golden lightning around him quickly dispersed.

"Brother Han, who was that person? Could it be a scout from the Heavenly Court, who has discovered us?" Lan Yan asked, still in a daze, with a mixture of admiration and alarm.

"Eight out of ten, but it's fine, he won't be leaking our information anymore," Han Li smiled faintly.

He could sense that the round-faced middle-aged man was not a split-body or the like, but a living, breathing cultivator.

He had exterminated him with lightning speed, and their information should not have been leaked.

However, to be cautious, they should still leave quickly.

"That's good," Lan Yan said, letting out a sigh of relief.

Han Li waved his hand and summoned the Ink Dragon Flying Boat, lifting the two of them into the air, and swiftly flew towards the distance, disappearing in an instant.

At this moment, in a secret courtyard within the Golden Spring City, a green-haired girl stood quietly, admiring a flowerbed in front of her, none other than the Miao Fa Xian Zun.

Just then, footsteps echoed from outside, and a green-clad girl entered.

"Saint Envoy, there's a message," the girl said softly.

"Ah, have you really found news about Han Li this time, or is it just another false lead?" Miao Fa Xian Zun asked, without turning around, still sniffing a pink flower in her hand.

"This time, the message is from our undercover agent in the Heavenly Court, who personally brought it, saying that there's even a recording of their encounter, so it should be true, but he wants to meet with you in person," the green-clad girl said.

"Ah, then let him come," Miao Fa Xian Zun said, tossing the flower aside, and turning around.

The green-clad girl nodded and quickly left, bringing a black-clad figure with her, who was none other than the round-faced middle-aged man, but his face was deathly pale, looking as if he had suffered a great blow, yet his expression was still excited.

"I pay my respects to Miao Fa Xian Zun," the round-faced middle-aged man bowed.

"Do you have news about Han Li?" Miao Fa Xian Zun asked, looking at the round-faced middle-aged man.

"Yes," he said, then took a deep breath, and recounted the events of discovering Han Li's anomaly in the Golden Tower, then following him to the Immortal Stacks, and finally, their encounter outside the city.

"This is the recording of our encounter," the round-faced middle-aged man flipped his hand, producing a black orb, with a light flashing within, showing the scene of their encounter.

"True Words Treasure Wheel! Lightning Law! No mistake, although his appearance is different, he's definitely Han Li," Miao Fa Xian Zun exclaimed, her eyes shining brightly.

The round-faced middle-aged man saw Miao Fa Xian Zun's reaction and let out a sigh of relief.

To verify Han Li's identity, he had paid an extremely heavy price, and if he had made a mistake, he would have suffered greatly.

"Where is he now?" Miao Fa Xian Zun asked, standing up.

"I used the Soul Rending Technique, leaving behind a split-body, and with my true body, I encountered him outside the Golden Spring City, he should think that he's thoroughly killed me, and preserved the information, so he won't use extreme measures to escape. Moreover, it's only been less than half an hour since our battle ended, with your abilities, even if he uses some means to try and escape, he shouldn't be able to escape your grasp," the round-faced middle-aged man said, taking out a map of the Golden Spring City, marking a location, which was where he and Han Li had encountered each other.

"Not bad, you're very thorough, and consider all aspects, Green Rui, bring him down, and reward him heavily," Miao Fa Xian Zun said, a hint of satisfaction on her face.

The round-faced middle-aged man was overjoyed, and thanked Miao Fa Xian Zun, before following the green-clad girl out of the courtyard.

Miao Fa Xian Zun's side had a flash of blue light, and two sixteen-year-old girls appeared, both wearing blue silk dresses, and looking identical, yet they were twins.

"Saint Envoy, since we've already obtained Han Li's information, to prevent the leak of information, should we...?" one of the girls asked, her hand slicing across her neck, her eyes cold.

"No need, this person is just a small-time opportunist, let's detain him for two days, and then release him, if we let people know that we're untrustworthy, and even kill people to silence them, who would be willing to work for our Nine Yuan Sect in the future?" Miao Fa Xian Zun said.

"Still, you're considering the long-term, Saint Envoy," the blue-clad girl said.

"These small matters don't need to be managed, now that we've finally found Han Li's information, capturing him is the top priority," Miao Fa Xian Zun waved her hand, and a blue light enveloped the two girls, flying towards the distance.
