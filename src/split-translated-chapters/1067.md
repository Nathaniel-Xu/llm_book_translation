Han Li naturally didn't have any objections to Su Zhen Cai's suggestion, after all, he wasn't a rash person.

The three of them each released their divine sense to search the surroundings, and after not finding any danger, they flew down and carefully searched the area, but unfortunately, they still didn't find anything special.

The palace was devoid of any living creatures' aura, with only ice and snow-filled winds remaining.

The three of them continued to search, and soon arrived at a grand hall deep within the palace.

This place was located in a deeper part of the palace, and the cold wind from outside could no longer be felt. The air flow was quite stable.

Han Li stepped into the grand hall, and his eyes suddenly flashed.

"What is it, Brother Shi? Have you discovered something?" Su Zhen Cai immediately noticed Han Li's subtle change in expression and asked.

Jin Liu heard the sound and also looked over, and at this moment, he had already put away his disdain for Han Li. Facing Han Li's change in expression, his heart also skipped a beat.

Han Li didn't respond to Su Zhen Cai's words, but instead quickly walked a few steps forward and picked up an object from the corner of the grand hall, which was a few half-transparent white hairs.

These hairs were over half a foot long, extremely soft, and incredibly fine, making them difficult to detect with the naked eye. If not for Han Li's strong divine sense, he probably wouldn't have noticed them.

"What are these hairs? They seem to be from some kind of unusual beast." Su Zhen Cai's expression changed as she said.

"Yes, since these hairs are here, it's possible that some kind of unusual beast is hiding here." Han Li flipped his hand and put the hairs away, looking towards the deeper part of the grand hall with a faint flash in his eyes.

Because he possessed multiple true spirit bloodlines, he was extremely sensitive to true spirit auras.

From these hairs, Han Li faintly sensed some true spirit aura, which was similar to his Qing Luan bloodline.

Su Zhen Cai and Jin Liu exchanged a glance, their expressions becoming more serious.

Jin Liu slightly pondered, then flicked his sleeve, and a green light shot out, landing on the ground in front of them.

After the light dissipated, a small, green beast appeared, shaped like a fox but with a longer nose than usual, and a pair of bright green eyes that were extremely agile.

The moment the fox appeared, it crouched down and sniffed the air, then quickly ran forward.

"Bì Jīng Líng Hú!" Han Li's eyebrows twitched.

"Ah, Brother Shi seems to be quite knowledgeable, recognizing my spirit beast." Jin Liu said with some surprise.

"I just happened to come across it in some ancient texts." Han Li said.

This fox was a type of fox that was not strong in combat, but its eyes and nose were extremely sensitive, making it suitable for exploration and treasure hunting. However, it was extremely rare, and few people possessed one.

"With this Bì Jīng Líng Hú leading the way, we'll be much safer following behind. Let's go." Jin Liu said.

The three of them followed the fox, continuing forward, and soon passed through several grand halls.

The buildings ahead suddenly became sparse, and a long corridor appeared.

After passing through the corridor, they simultaneously felt a sense of joy, quickly moving forward, and arrived at a dark and grand hall.

The hall was about 20-30 meters in size, with nothing inside, and a stone door stood at the far end, adorned with a dark red light door, which was a spatial door.

There were no restrictions on this spatial door, possibly because it had already been broken through.

"A spatial door, and we found it without any effort." Su Zhen Cai said with some excitement.

However, Su Zhen Cai didn't immediately approach the door, instead, she carefully searched the hall with her divine sense.

The more easily obtained the benefit, the more traps there were, and one couldn't be careless.

Han Li and Jin Liu were also doing the same, with Jin Liu driving the Bì Jīng Líng Hú to run around the hall and explore.

The three of them searched for a while, and their expressions became somewhat strange.

No matter how they searched, even Su Zhen Cai directly opened her spirit domain, they still didn't find any traps or dangers.

"It seems that something happened here, causing this part of the palace to collapse, and the imprisoned existence either fell or left. Let's go, we'll head directly to the fifth floor." Su Zhen Cai said, then led the way into the spatial door, and indeed, nothing unusual happened, and they entered smoothly.

Han Li and Jin Liu saw this, and also followed, entering the spatial door.

The scenery in front of them changed, and they appeared on a desolate and barren plain.

The plain was also filled with howling winds and flying sand, with no end in sight, and the horizon stretched out endlessly.

Apart from this, all around them, there were numerous earthen mountains, shaped by the wind into various strange and fantastical forms, looking quite peculiar.

Su Zhen Cai was currently floating in mid-air, looking around.

"This place is quite strange." Han Li and Jin Liu also looked around.

The time restriction in the void was even stronger here, and their divine sense could only explore about 10% of the distance.
The time restriction in the void not only greatly reduced the range of their divine senses, but also seemed to press down on their divine souls like a boulder, affecting the accuracy of their divine sense probing. The faces of Han Li, Su Zhen, and Jin Liu all turned solemn.

"Let's go," Su Zhen said with a light sigh. "If this tower really has seven layers, then we only have three left. I hope we can pass through this layer smoothly."

As they moved forward, the winds in this place grew stronger, sweeping away the ground and stirring up countless large and small rocks that swirled in the air, blocking out the sun and sky like a sandstorm.

Han Li's eyes flashed as he suddenly stopped flying, looking towards the rolling winds ahead.

"What's wrong, Brother Shi?" Su Zhen and Jin Liu asked, also stopping.

"This wind is strange, it's not a natural phenomenon, but rather someone's manipulation," Han Li said, his brow furrowed.

Su Zhen and Jin Liu were taken aback, carefully probing their surroundings, and soon their expressions also changed.

They also discovered the anomaly in the winds, which contained threads of spiritual energy fluctuations, indicating that someone was indeed influencing it.

"It seems we can't pass through this layer as easily as the fourth layer," Jin Liu said quietly. "What should we do? Should we go take a look?"

The one who could stir up such a massive storm must be extremely powerful, and might be the one imprisoned in this layer.

"According to our previous experience, the spatial gates are usually near the objects being imprisoned, so we must go and investigate," Su Zhen said after a moment of contemplation.

"Not bad, if we don't enter the tiger's den, how can we catch the tiger?" Han Li's eyes flashed with insight, and he nodded in agreement.

Jin Liu only hesitated for a moment, but since Su Zhen and Han Li agreed, he didn't strongly object.

The three quickly flew forward, following the spiritual energy fluctuations in the void, tracing them to their source.

As they went deeper, the winds grew stronger, and the spiritual energy fluctuations became more intense, so they didn't need to worry about losing track, and simply followed the fluctuations.

The terrain ahead changed, with more and more earthen hills and mountains forming, gradually becoming a continuous range of yellow-brown mountains.

After half an hour, the three finally found the source of the spiritual energy fluctuations.

They stood at the edge of a massive canyon, hiding their auras and gazing out.

Before them, the canyon was filled with dozens of massive white dragon-like wind columns, each hundreds of feet thick and tens of miles long, shooting up into the sky.

The wind columns contained extremely terrifying spiritual energy and law energy, almost capable of destroying the heavens and earth, and seemed to be waving about like giant tentacles, crushing and devouring everything in their path.

The ground and sky were both shaken, rumbling with thunder.

In the largest white wind column, a white figure could be faintly seen, but due to the obstruction of the wind column, their appearance couldn't be clearly discerned. The law energy within the wind column was also too intense, making it impossible to probe with their divine senses.

Before the dozens of wind columns, a group of cultivators were flying about, struggling against the winds. There were five or six of them, each displaying their divine abilities and fighting against the wind columns.

"Ah, it's them..." Han Li's eyes flashed.

The group of people were the ones they had parted ways with in the first layer, including Lei Yu Ce, Wen Zhong, a pair of young black-clothed men and women, and the young man who had appeared with Qi Mozi.

Aside from these five, there was also an unexpected person - the blue-robed youth who had escaped from Han Li's grasp.

Su Zhen and Jin Liu were also shocked, their faces filled with surprise.

The dozens of white wind columns were incredibly powerful, and Lei Yu Ce's group was being suppressed, forced to retreat step by step.

What was even more astonishing was that Han Li felt the white figure within the wind column hadn't used their full strength, seemingly toying with Lei Yu Ce's group.

"Hmph, with your strength, you think you can reach the sixth layer? You're not even worthy of being a plaything for me!" a sharp, ear-piercing voice came from within the wind column, followed by a loud laugh.

As the voice fell, the wind columns suddenly merged into one, forming a massive white wind column that engulfed the six cultivators.

The wind column was enormous, like a pillar supporting the sky, its power several times greater than before, with a momentum that seemed to change the very fabric of the world.

Lei Yu Ce's group was trapped within the wind column, their divine abilities and magical tools unable to be used, their bodies helpless against the wind's power.

Su Zhen and Jin Liu watched from a distance, their faces pale.

Lei Yu Ce was a top expert in the Golden Origin Realm, and the others were also extremely powerful, yet they were so easily trapped.

Han Li's brow furrowed, the white wind column seeming ordinary, yet containing wind attribute law energy that was incredibly powerful. Even he would find it difficult to break through.

"Wait, that's not right!"

Han Li's eyes flashed with purple light as he exclaimed.

The fifth layer's influence on their divine senses was too great, making it hard to perceive clearly. Only by using his Nine Yin Magic Eyes could he discover the secret of the white wind column.

It seemed to contain two different wind attribute law energies, perfectly merged and indistinguishable from one another.
