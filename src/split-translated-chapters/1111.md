Han Li's figure shifted, and his gaze swept past the golden armored cultivators, landing on the five-colored altar. His expression was uncertain, as if he was pondering something.

"Is Fellow Daoist Han onto something?" Fox Three's eyes flashed, and he asked.

"These cultivators can borrow power from the altar," Han Li said. "If we don't find a way to block it, it will only get more troublesome."

Han Li's words were met with a nod from Jiao Three, who had also retreated from the battlefield. "Fellow Daoist Han, what method do you propose?"

"I want to try using my spiritual domain to isolate this connection," Han Li said. "However, my spiritual domain alone may not be enough. I need your help."

"Can I just release my spiritual domain?" Jiao Three asked.

"Not yet. First, let's focus on isolating these golden armored cultivators. If we can break one of them, the others will follow," Han Li said.

"Alright, let's do it," Jiao Three said.

"Not yet, I'll inform the others first," Han Li said, and he transmitted his voice to Lei Yuze and the others, telling them that he would be constricting his spiritual domain and asking them to be prepared.

After everyone acknowledged, Han Li nodded to Jiao Three.

Suddenly, a golden spiritual domain contracted, and a dark red spiritual domain expanded, their ranges almost completely overlapping. The golden armored cultivators were surrounded by the two spiritual domains.

As the spiritual domains constricted, Lei Yuze and the others felt a sudden sluggishness, and they frantically activated their internal spiritual energy to resist the temporal laws of the Years God Lamp.

Meanwhile, Han Li's spiritual domain and Jiao Three's spiritual domain merged, producing a strange aura. The light from both spiritual domains surged several times, and the aura emitted by them also increased greatly.

The golden armored cultivators trapped within the two spiritual domains saw the light on their golden spears dim, and even the golden light vortex on the spear tips began to disappear.

"It's working! Break through the formation quickly!" Han Li exclaimed, his heart filled with joy.

At his command, Jiao Three and Fox Three were also greatly invigorated, and with Han Li's cultivators cooperating, they quickly slaughtered the golden armored cultivators, creating a gap in the formation.

Just as Han Li was about to celebrate, a loud "rumble" echoed from the other side, and flames erupted into the air. It seemed that Qi Mozi's cultivators had also been defeated.

The cultivators on both sides were broken through, and the original five-element interdependence was disrupted. The remaining cultivators were unable to operate smoothly and were defeated one by one.

Han Li saw this and quickly gathered the remaining cultivators, taking a large step forward as he prepared to rush towards the altar.

However, just as he was about to do so, a black and white light suddenly erupted from the ground, and a black and white figure flew out silently. The figure flashed by, passing over the cultivators, and flew straight towards the altar.

Han Li's eyes narrowed as he watched the figure, and he discovered that it was a young woman dressed in a black and white silk robe. Her face was cold and expressionless, with a faint black and white aura surrounding her.

What surprised Han Li even more was that his gaze could lock onto the woman's figure, but his spiritual sense couldn't detect any aura from her. It was as if she was a mere illusion.

The others were also unaware of the woman's presence from the beginning.

"What is this thing...?" Jiao Three exclaimed in surprise.

"A puppet hiding the yin and yang laws? This is indeed rare. I wonder whose handiwork this is?" Qi Mozi sneered, her eyes scanning the surroundings quickly.

Lei Yuze and the others looked at each other in confusion, but they didn't have time to investigate further. They chased after the woman.

The black and white woman stretched out her hand, and a three-foot square taiji shield condensed from the black and white light on her palm. The shield resisted the suppressive force of the altar, allowing her to break through unimpeded.

Her hand landed on the three command plates belonging to Qu Lin, not on the golden scroll, the black iron plate, or the golden lamp.

"Stop!" Fox Three shouted, his hand flashing as he drew the Celestial Fox Blood Knife.

A blood-red arc of light shot out, resembling a blood-red crescent moon, and flew towards the black and white woman's back.

The woman didn't seem to react, but her other hand formed a strange hand seal, and a burst of black and white light erupted from her back. The light condensed into a massive taiji double fish diagram.

The blood-red arc of light struck the double fish diagram, and a blinding flash of blood-red light exploded. A fierce, razor-sharp power burst forth from the light, cutting through the surrounding void and causing the light to become distorted.

However, the next instant, the black and white light on the double fish diagram began to rotate rapidly, emitting a strange wave that transmitted a formless attractive force. The blood-red light was absorbed into the diagram, and it disappeared.

At the same time, the black and white woman's hand had already reached into the golden lamp, grasping for the three command plates.

But just as she was about to obtain them, a sudden change occurred!
Only the translated text is provided below:

The golden lantern, shaped like a lotus flower, suddenly shook violently, and a blinding golden light burst forth from it.

The wick inside the lantern flared up, and the flame grew stronger.

With a loud "boom," a circle of golden flames erupted from the wick, spreading out in all directions like a tidal wave.

The black and white woman, who was closest to the lantern, was the first to be hit. She had just opened a layer of Taiji pattern in front of her, but the flames struck her with great force, sending her flying backward. She crashed into the temple door and fell to the ground.

As she struggled to get up, she rolled away and disappeared into the ground.

Lei Yuze and the others, who were chasing after her, were caught off guard by the sudden eruption of flames. They retreated in all directions, trying to avoid the flames.

Lan Yuansu pulled Lan Yan behind him and swung his hand, summoning a blue cloth bag that appeared out of thin air. The bag emitted a loud rumbling sound, and a blue mist burst forth, forming a water screen that blocked the flames.

The flames collided with the water screen, causing a massive explosion that sent Lan Yuansu and Lan Yan flying backward. They landed on the ground, with Lan Yan unscathed but Lan Yuansu spitting out a mouthful of blood.

"Brother, how are you?" Lan Yan asked, concern etched on her face.

Lan Yuansu waved his hand, indicating that he was fine, and stood up, putting the blue cloth bag away.

Compared to the two of them, the others were more severely affected by the flames. Even the five demons with thick skin were forced to retreat.

Xiong Shan, who had kept his distance from the altar, was the least affected.

On the other hand, Han Li and Qimozi were not affected by the flames at all. Instead, they took advantage of the situation to charge forward, continuing their approach to the altar.

Han Li's body was surrounded by five time law objects, which emitted a powerful time law force that allowed him to resist the flames and approach the altar.

Qimozi, who had only one golden torch floating in front of him, was able to release a time law force that was even stronger than Han Li's. He was also at a higher cultivation level than Han Li, and he reached the altar first.

His eyes were filled with golden light, and his pupils reflected the image of the lotus flower lantern.

"Ha ha, the Years God Lamp is finally mine!" Qimozi exclaimed, his face filled with joy.

As he spoke, his hand, which was wrapped in a layer of golden light, reached out to grab the lamp.

But the lamp didn't budge, as if it were rooted to the altar.

Qimozi's brow furrowed, and he summoned all his spiritual energy, causing his aura to surge wildly. He was at the peak of his cultivation level, and his power was unmatched.

Finally, the Years God Lamp was shaken by his massive force, and the lamp's body tilted slightly.

The golden oil inside the lamp spilled out, and a small drop of it was ignited by the wick, falling to the ground.

Qimozi's eyes widened in shock, and the golden torch in front of him flew to his chest, merging with his body.

At the same time, his arm, which was wrapped in golden light, was enveloped by a spiral-shaped golden flame that resembled a dragon.

The drop of oil that had fallen to the ground suddenly erupted into a fierce golden flame, which pounced on Qimozi's arm.

When the two flames, both of which contained time laws, met, a shocking scene unfolded.

The flames on Qimozi's arm only burned for a moment before retreating back into his body, but his arm was consumed by the flames, turning into a charred stump in the blink of an eye.

Taking advantage of Qimozi's struggle with the lamp, Han Li caught up to him and reached out to grab the other objects on the altar.

"No!" Qimozi cried out in alarm.

His charred arm broke off at the shoulder, but his other hand shot out to grab the remaining objects on the altar.

Han Li's hand swept past, grabbing the golden book scroll and two blood-colored tokens. Qimozi's hand, however, grasped the black iron token and the last blood-colored token.

The two of them didn't have time to fight over the objects, as they both retreated quickly, fleeing from the altar as the Years God Lamp continued to malfunction.
