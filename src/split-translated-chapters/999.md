Han Li watched as Shi Po Kong and the others departed, his spiritual sense carefully scanning the surroundings to ensure there were no abnormalities before turning back to the great hall.

Inside the hall, the jade bed in the water pool was where Qi Hun was lying on her side, her already petite body curled up into a ball, her eyebrows tightly furrowed, and her face filled with pain.

Han Li's heart stirred, and he immediately focused his spiritual sense on her, examining her body.

A moment later, his expression relaxed, and he let out a silent sigh of relief.

Although Qi Hun was still trapped in a deep sleep, her body had undergone a significant transformation.

Especially in her dantian, the flickering and unstable source energy was like a faint light in a dark room, the flame weak but warm.

A splashing sound came from behind the stone bed, and Han Li turned to see the Grand Priest emerging from the water, his body covered in wisps of gray smoke, and a smell of charred flesh emanating from him.

When he saw Han Li's face, his expression changed, and he couldn't help but ask, "Your face..."

The Grand Priest smiled wryly, touching his cheek, and said, "Using the power of the cycle of reincarnation to forcibly probe the heavens, what can I expect but to pay a price?"

His neck and face were covered in burn-like scars, filled with pus that flowed like molten lava, emitting a foul and scorching aura.

"What about the scars on your body?" Han Li asked, his brow furrowed.

"Each time I probe the heavens, these scars appear, like a heavenly punishment. No matter what spiritual pills or elixirs I use, they're useless. At first, they were just thick scabs, but later they formed into tumors. Over time, I've become like this, neither human nor ghost."

The Grand Priest smiled wryly, his voice hoarse, and said, "I've been punished by the heavens, and my body has become like this."

Han Li understood, and he realized that the Grand Priest's reluctance to help Qi Hun was not only due to the Crown Prince's influence but also because of his own circumstances.

It could be said that when this heavenly punishment reached a certain level, even with high cultivation, one couldn't escape the fate of falling. From the current situation, the Grand Priest was already close to this critical point.

"This is a debt I owe the Grand Priest," Han Li said after a moment of contemplation. "If there's anything I can do, please don't hesitate to ask."

The Grand Priest walked out of the water pool, his voice low, and said, "For now, there's nothing I need. But if there's an opportunity in the future, I'll need your help, Brother Han."

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he asked, "What kind of help?"

"The heavens' secrets cannot be revealed," the Grand Priest said, shaking his head.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he was about to ask again when Qi Hun suddenly groaned, as if she was about to wake up.

"Qi Hun..." Han Li called out softly.

However, Qi Hun only shuddered again and didn't truly wake up.

The Grand Priest explained, "Her source energy was lost for too long, and her spiritual energy was severely depleted. If not for your help in stabilizing her soul, she would have already dissipated. Don't worry, she just needs some time to recover, and she'll wake up on her own."

Han Li's concerns were alleviated, and he thought of something else, asking, "How will you explain this to the Third Prince?"

The Grand Priest smiled, glancing at the two men still lying unconscious at the entrance, and said, "I'll just say I was coerced by you, Brother Han. If you're still worried, you can always make it look like I was forced to help you."

Han Li chuckled and continued, "The Third Prince might not be so easily fooled..."

The Grand Priest's voice was hoarse, and he said, "Even if he's not, I'm the Grand Priest of the Holy Tribe. He won't dare to be too excessive. Besides, he didn't gain anything from his visit, so what right does he have to blame me?"

Han Li nodded in agreement.

Later, he took Qi Hun back to the Flower Branch Cave Heaven and stayed by her side.

Until the second day, Qi Hun still didn't wake up, but her aura had improved, and Han Li felt slightly better. He bid farewell to the Grand Priest and left the great hall, heading towards the Demon Palace.

However, he had only just left when he saw Shi Po Kong waiting for him in the square with over a dozen people.

Han Li's gaze swept over them, and he noticed that besides the old man from the previous night, there were three Taiyi late-stage cultivators, and seven or eight Taiyi mid-stage and early-stage cultivators.

The Third Prince was making a big show of things, but Han Li's expression remained calm, and he smiled, saying, "Is the Third Prince trying to intimidate me?"

Shi Po Kong laughed, "Brother Li, you're a guest of our Holy Tribe, and now that you're leaving, we must see you off with courtesy."

Han Li smiled, and his figure flashed, passing the group and standing in front of them.

Shi Po Kong's eyes narrowed, and he snapped his fan shut, following Han Li, "Brother Li, I must ask, do you think it's too late for me to regret not befriending you earlier?"

Han Li smiled, "I'm not sure if you're referring to when I first arrived in Night City or when I entered the Accumulated Scales Realm."

Shi Po Kong walked alongside Han Li, asking, "Am I too late to make amends?"
"What's the difference?" Shi Po Kong asked.

"Actually, there's no difference, as long as you gave me the Void Boundary Token before, it wouldn't be too late. Unfortunately... you, Third Prince, don't have the Time Reversal Technique, so there's no need to regret." Han Li shook his head.

"That's really too unfortunate..." Shi Po Kong sighed, saying.

Han Li heard this, his face revealed a hesitant expression, and he was rarely moved, sighing: "Between you and Shi Chuan Kong, why is it like this?"

Shi Po Kong naturally knew what Han Li was referring to, but unfortunately, there were some secrets that couldn't be shared with outsiders, so he just sighed again and didn't say anything, his face showing a hint of desolation.

Han Li saw this and didn't say anything more, just continuing on his way.

The group flew through the air until they reached a square in the south garden of the Demon Palace, where they landed.

Han Li's gaze swept across the area, and he saw a strange, conical building in the distance that resembled a sharp tower. The tower's surface was covered in circular patterns that connected to each other, forming a complex network of symbols that extended all the way to the ground.

The tower was only a hundred or so meters tall, but its base took up a third of its height, and its exterior was embedded with a ring of transparent, crystal-like stones that refracted the sunlight, casting a kaleidoscope of colors that made it hard to look directly at.

"Is this the legendary Void Tower?" Han Li asked, his brow furrowed.

"Ordinary transmission arrays can't directly return to the Immortal Realm, so we have to use this Void Tower to tear through the void and return." Shi Po Kong nodded.

"Can this tower return me to the Northern Cold Immortal Domain?" Han Li asked, his brow raised.

"Cross-domain transmission is extremely difficult, and the resources required are enormous. Even if we tear through the void, we can only reach the nearest location in the adjacent domain." Shi Po Kong smiled.

"Where is that?" Han Li asked.

"The Golden Source Immortal Domain." Shi Po Kong looked at him.

"Where is the Golden Source Immortal Domain?" Han Li asked, his brow furrowed.

Although Han Li had never been to this domain, he wasn't unfamiliar with it. After all, the Nine Yuan Observatory and the Hundred Forge Mountain were both located within it, and Jintong was probably still there.

"There are a few transmission arrays in the Golden Source Immortal Domain, such as the Nine Yuan Observatory and the Shouyang Mountain, but they require a sect's token to activate. If you don't have one, you can only rely on luck, so you might be randomly transmitted to any location in the Golden Source Immortal Domain." Shi Po Kong smiled.

"Let's go." Han Li thought for a moment before speaking decisively.

He took the lead, walking into the Void Tower.

Shi Po Kong followed him, his brow furrowed in concern.

As they entered the tower, Han Li saw that the floor was covered in symbol patterns, and several snow-white stone pillars stood in the center, also adorned with strange patterns.

The walls of the tower were embedded with transparent, crystal-like stones that reflected the light, casting a series of overlapping shadows.

In the center of the room, a ten-meter-high platform stood, topped with a lifelike carving of a Luozhen Spirit. The platform was surrounded by a complex network of symbols that seemed to be flowing with energy.

"It's been a while, I hope we won't meet again in this sacred domain." Shi Po Kong suddenly spoke up.

"I, Li, always keep my word." Han Li smiled ambiguously.

"Good, please enter the array." Shi Po Kong nodded.

Han Li examined the array again, noticing that it was identical to the one the High Priest had described to him the night before. He nodded and stepped forward.

"Li, rest assured, this Void Tower is extremely valuable, and I wouldn't dare tamper with it. If it's damaged, it would be like destroying half of the Sacred Tribe's imperial city." Shi Po Kong smiled.

Han Li didn't say anything, just looking at Shi Po Kong before nodding.

The latter didn't say anything more, just waving his hand.

The several Demon Tribe elders behind him immediately dispersed, sitting down at the four corners of the array and closing their eyes to begin activating the Void Tower.

As a humming noise filled the air, the floor of the tower began to vibrate, and the platform in the center lit up with a silver glow, enveloping Han Li.

The symbol patterns on the floor began to shine brightly, and the crystal-like stones on the walls refracted the light, casting a dazzling array of colors that made it hard to look directly at.

Han Li stood at the center of the array, surrounded by the intense energy, as the space around him began to distort and converge.

Just as the array was about to activate, Han Li heard Shi Po Kong's voice:

"Until we meet again, Han Li."
