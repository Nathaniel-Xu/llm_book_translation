The high priest saw the situation and waved his hand, causing the water in the pool to churn and a white jade stone bed to slowly rise from the water. The bed was covered in a layer of frost, and on top of it lay a young woman with a pale complexion, her face serene and her chest still. It was as if she were a perfectly preserved corpse.

The high priest walked forward, removing his hood to reveal a handsome young face with a pale complexion. He gazed at the woman's body, then turned to Han Li and said, "Brother Han, please remove the puppet seal from her body."

Han Li nodded and stepped forward, his hands forming a seal as he conjured a white starlight force from his palm. The force flowed from the woman's head, down her neck, shoulders, and finally to her feet, where it exited through the Yongquan acupoint.

As the force passed through each acupoint, a thin white bone needle emerged from her body, each one covered in intricate symbols. Han Li collected the needles, and as he did, the woman's eyebrows furrowed, and her body began to convulse violently.

The high priest's eyes widened as he sensed the woman's aura, and he exclaimed, "This is...!"

Han Li explained, "She is not human, but a creature known as a 'Xing Shou' or 'Punishment Beast', a type of heavenly beast."

The high priest nodded, "I understand. As a Punishment Beast, she possesses the power of the Wheel of Reincarnation, one of the three supreme laws of the universe. I couldn't sense her aura earlier, but now that the seal is removed, I still can't sense any power within her. This must be why she fell into a coma."

Han Li nodded, "That's correct. She was affected by a certain law of the universe, which caused her to lose her connection to her innate power."

The high priest continued, "If we can use the Wheel of Reincarnation law to awaken her, she should recover."

Han Li's expression turned skeptical, "Is it that simple?"

The high priest replied, "The Wheel of Reincarnation law is extremely difficult to master, even more so than the Space Law. To control its power, one must be extremely cautious, lest they suffer unforeseen consequences."

Han Li asked, "I didn't know that the Wheel of Reincarnation law was so powerful. Are you saying that you've mastered it?"

The high priest chuckled, "I've only learned a fraction of its power through my study of the Tian Yuan prophecy technique. While I can use it to predict the future, I haven't truly mastered the law."

Han Li's eyes widened, "So, you're saying that you'll use your knowledge of the Wheel of Reincarnation law to help her awaken her innate power?"

The high priest nodded, "That's correct. If we canâ€”"

Just then, the woman's body relaxed, and her eyebrows unfurrowed. A faint glow appeared on her forehead, and wispy strands of white light emerged, like silk threads floating in the air.

Han Li's expression changed, "What's happening? Her soul is escaping!"

The high priest shook his head, "It's not surprising. When her innate power is lost, her soul becomes like a floating leaf, unable to remain within her body. The 108 soul-sealing needles were used to lock her soul in place, but now that they're gone, her soul is beginning to escape."

Han Li's eyes widened, and he quickly activated his spiritual technique, pointing to his own forehead and drawing a line of spiritual energy that shot out and merged with the woman's forehead. The wispy strands of white light disappeared, and the woman's soul was once again contained within her body.

Han Li turned to the high priest, "Please, you must save her now."

The high priest nodded, "I'll begin the treatment. Please, Brother Han, protect me during this time."
The High Priest reassured, "Rest assured, I will not be disturbed while I administer the treatment."

The High Priest did not say another word, and instead walked to the other side of the white jade bed, standing behind the wailing spirit's skull. He clasped his hands together in front of him, as if praying to the heavens, and then opened his hands, waving them forward as if scattering money.

A burst of blood flowers shot out from his palms, transforming into five blood-red plum blossoms that fell onto the wailing spirit's forehead. The center of his palms also split open, revealing twisted and distorted patterns like a turtle shell.

At the same time, a blurry red glow appeared behind him, and his robes fluttered in the wind, even though there was no wind. A familiar yet unfamiliar aura of the law emanated from him.

Han Li suddenly caught a glimpse of the High Priest's exposed skin under his robes, and a wave of nausea washed over him.

Underneath the High Priest's handsome face, his skin was covered in large, festering wounds, most of which were oozing pus and had turned a deep purple. The wounds were mixed with yellowish-brown mucus, making them look particularly disgusting.

These scars were clearly old injuries, some of which had already healed and left behind large, tumor-like scars. Others had only formed a ring of scabs around the wound, while some still had pus oozing out.

The High Priest's body was so swollen and fat because of these numerous tumors and growths. Han Li couldn't help but feel a sense of pity when he looked at the High Priest's handsome face.

Earlier, because of the strong medicinal scent in the air, Han Li had not noticed anything out of the ordinary. However, now that he caught a whiff of the High Priest's body odor, he was struck by its pungency.

"Brother Han, if you find it difficult to endure, you can go outside and keep watch. The treatment will take at least an hour," the High Priest's voice suddenly echoed in Han Li's mind.

"No need," Han Li replied curtly, without saying another word.

The High Priest did not respond.

However, after a few dozen breaths, Han Li frowned and spoke up again, "It seems I must go outside after all..."

"Brother Han, please be at ease. Just make sure no one disturbs us," the High Priest instructed.

"Thank you," Han Li said, bowing and making a gesture of respect before flashing out of the hall.

In the distance, a few streaks of light pierced the dark night sky, landing several dozen feet away from Han Li.

The leader of the group was a man with snow-white hair that was neatly combed and tied up with a pearl crown. His eyes were a deep purple, and his face was handsome, with a strong resemblance to Shi Chongyun. Han Li confirmed that it was his third brother, Shi Po Kong.

Behind him were two demon men. One was a giant of a man, with a body like an iron tower and a metal mask that covered half his face, leaving only his nose and mouth exposed. His face was twisted in a fierce expression.

The other was a slender man dressed in a blue robe, with white hair and a gentle smile. He looked like a ordinary teacher from the mortal realm, with his hands clasped behind his back.

Han Li's spiritual sense suddenly expanded, enveloping the surrounding area. He discovered that, apart from the palace guards, there were only three people present.

The iron tower man's aura was shocking, but he was the weakest of the three, with a cultivation level of only mid-stage Taishi. Shi Po Kong, on the other hand, was also a mid-stage Taishi, but his aura was more stable and long-lasting. The gentle old man, who looked like a teacher, was the strongest of the three, with a cultivation level of late-stage Taishi.

"Ah, Brother Li, it's been a while," Shi Po Kong said with a smile, his hands clasped together in a gesture of respect.

"Thank you for your concern, Brother Shi," Han Li replied with a smile. "I didn't die in the Jiling Caverns, thanks to your care."

"Since you've returned to the Holy Land, my thirteenth brother should also be back, right? Where is he now?" Shi Po Kong asked, his smile growing wider.

"Shi Chongyun has always considered you his closest friend and never had any intention of competing with you," Han Li replied, his expression unchanged. "Don't you think it's unnecessary to do all this?"

"Brother Li, you're a clever person, surely you know that 'not competing' is actually the biggest competition of all," Shi Po Kong said, his expression turning slightly somber before returning to normal. "Besides, it's not something he can decide, nor is it something I can decide."

"Your brothers' competition or lack thereof has no bearing on me," Han Li said, his expression indifferent. "I don't want to get involved, so as long as you don't disturb me, we can each go our separate ways."

"I won't stop you, but can you tell me what happened in the Jiling Caverns?" Shi Po Kong asked, his brow furrowing. "Why did all the pawns I placed inside fall silent?"

Han Li's expression remained calm, and he replied, "I won't tell you."
