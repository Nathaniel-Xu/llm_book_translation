The burly man with the long beard seemed to have anticipated Jin Tong's sudden approach, and had already taken a step back. He didn't engage with Jin Tong, instead continuing to chant and manipulate the magic seals in his hand.

The other three people moved in tandem, their actions almost seamless. Han Li sensed that something was off and called out to Jin Tong, who flashed with golden light as the Time Domain opened up.

However, the domain had only just opened when the surrounding sea was enveloped in a brilliant silver glow. A massive magical array, seemingly conjured from the depths of the ocean, shot up a beam of light that illuminated the sky.

In an instant, a strange spatial distortion emanated from the sea floor, enveloping the surrounding heaven and earth. Han Li's expression changed, and he grabbed Jin Tong, who had just flown back. The two of them were surrounded by a flash of golden lightning, and their figures vanished from their original location.

However, they reappeared a short distance away, still above the sea. Han Li's brow furrowed, and he said, "The space has been sealed off; the Thunder Array technique cannot escape."

Jin Tong smiled nonchalantly and said, "No matter, we'll just break through it."

As soon as she spoke, a blinding silver light erupted from the four directions. Han Li looked around and saw that the four women in purple robes were holding silver mirrors that shone with intense light. The mirrors emitted a thick, silver beam that merged with the original beam of light, creating a dazzling display of silver light and shadow.

The light and shadow coalesced into a patchwork of silver screens that overlapped and merged, obscuring the sky. The next instant, the screens merged with the sea floor array, creating a blinding flash of silver light that transformed the surrounding area into a desolate wasteland.

Han Li and Jin Tong didn't have time to react before the surroundings began to change. The clear sky turned dark, and the void seemed to be torn apart, revealing a dark, inky blackness beneath.

The two of them were surrounded by an endless darkness, with only their own auras providing any light. Jin Tong wondered, "Is this an illusion?"

Han Li's eyes flashed with a deep, purple light, and he said slowly, "It's not an illusion, but a profound spatial secret art. We're no longer in the Dragon Abyss Immortal Realm..."

He only realized now why his divine sense hadn't detected the array earlier. It was because the array hadn't been there initially; it was only summoned by the four women when they appeared.

Jin Tong furrowed her brow and said, "It's strange that there's only our auras within a hundred million miles. They're making such a big fuss just to trap us here? This place may have its spiritual energy sealed off, but it won't affect us too much."

Han Li shook his head and said, "You'll understand if you expand your divine sense. This is a prison, and they're trying to trap us here."

Jin Tong did as he said, and her expression changed. Indeed, outside the void, a strange spatial force had formed a massive spatial barrier, isolating them from the outside world.

Jin Tong pondered for a moment before saying, "They're surrounding us without attacking, trapping us here. Could it be to prevent us from going to the Heavenly Court?"

Han Li smiled and said, "The Bodhi banquet should have started by now. For them to send four Daotian to deal with us, it's likely that's their intention. As a mere Da Luo realm cultivator, I'm surprised they're taking me so seriously."

Jin Tong snorted and said, "You've already defeated three corpses, and two of the Daotian, including Xuan Yuan Jie, one of the Seven Heavenly Kings. You think this attention is unexpected? I'm not surprised at all; I think they're being too careless."

Han Li chuckled and rubbed his nose, feeling a sense of wistfulness. Indeed, with his current cultivation and aura, even if the Time Daotian himself came to kill him, it wouldn't be surprising.

Jin Tong cracked her knuckles and said, "If this place can really trap us, that would be the surprise."

Han Li looked into the distance and said slowly, "Let's focus on breaking through this spatial barrier first."
Jin Tong nodded, and a flash of golden light burst forth from his body as he suddenly retreated into the distance.

After a few breaths, a massive golden light burst forth in the dark void tens of thousands of miles away, and a gigantic golden beetle suddenly appeared, colliding with something unknown and emitting a deafening boom.

Immediately after, a silver glow surged forth in the void, and a massive barrier imbued with powerful spatial laws emerged, its surface rippling with silver waves that spread out in all directions, seemingly endless.

Jin Tong's first attack was unsuccessful, and his golden light surged again, condensing into a spiral-shaped beam of light that shot forth towards the barrier.

"Boom..."

Another deafening boom shook the air, and Jin Tong's massive body was sent flying back, but the silver barrier remained unscathed.

Just as Jin Tong was about to try again, Han Li intervened.

"This place has a strange spatial energy, and the barrier outside seems to be connected to even more powerful forces. Brute force may not be enough to break through, so let's calm down and look for any weaknesses first." Han Li advised.

Jin Tong's golden light dimmed, and he returned to his human form.

The two of them discussed their plan and separated, carefully examining the barrier from different directions.

...

Outside the spatial barrier, a dark and desolate void stretched out, similar to the void outside the realm.

The four Dao Ancestors who had previously clashed with Han Li and Jin Tong were now floating outside the barrier, their expressions grave as they gazed intently at the situation inside.

It was strange, but the barrier seemed to be transparent from the outside, allowing them to see everything inside.

"Zi Shan, do you think they have any chance of breaking through this 'Ten Directions, Ten Thousand Immortals Array'?" the bearded man, Dong Li Hu, asked.

"You've said it yourself, this is the Ten Directions, Ten Thousand Immortals Array. Even if the four of us were trapped inside, we might not be able to break through. At least... not without a thousand years of effort." the tall, purple-robed woman, Zi Shan, replied.

"Dong Li Hu, do you think they have the ability to break through?" the ugly old woman, Zhu Yan, asked.

"Zhu Yan, you're underestimating them. One of them is a Devouring Law Dao Ancestor, and the other is a Time Law Great Luo Peak cultivator. They're not to be underestimated, even if they're not as powerful as the seven Heavenly Kings." Dong Li Hu replied calmly.

"This Ten Directions, Ten Thousand Immortals Array is no ordinary formation. It's a massive barrier that gathers the power of ten realms, with each realm guarded by tens of Great Luo cultivators, hundreds of Tai Yi Jade Immortals, and thousands of Golden Immortals. If they can break through this, what face will we have left to return to the Heavenly Court?" Zhu Yan sneered.

As she spoke, her gaze drifted towards the distant void, where ten massive "heavenly gates" seemed to be opening on the dark sky.

Through these gates, one could see the interiors of ten different realms, each with its own unique landscape. Some were situated on mountain peaks, others on island shores, and others in ancient forests...

On these mountains and islands, massive formations had been built, each with a gigantic stone pillar at its center, adorned with intricate symbols.

The Great Luo, Tai Yi, and Golden Immortal cultivators that Zhu Yan had mentioned were all seated around these pillars, their hands weaving intricate patterns as they chanted incantations to maintain the formations.

Beneath them, silver light waves rose from the ground, layer by layer, and condensed into the central pillar.

These ten realms, hidden from view, were experiencing a rapid depletion of spiritual energy, causing forests to wither and rivers to dry up.

This array, supported by the power of ten realms and tens of thousands of cultivators, was truly unparalleled.

Han Li and Jin Tong would never have imagined that they would be facing such a massive, ancient formation, not to mention the four Dao Ancestors watching from the outside.

Just then, the silent, white-haired man with a childlike face spoke up in a high-pitched voice.

"Zhu Yan, you mentioned returning to the Heavenly Court to report... didn't we receive orders to trap him here and then join forces to kill him?"

"Ah, Meng Yuan, you're saying that so lightly... didn't you hear about the previous incident where Xuan Yuan Jie was killed? He was a Five Elements Origin Dao Ancestor, and his power was above ours." Zhu Yan's face creased with concern.

"I've already heard about that from the people who escaped. Han Li won due to the help of the Devouring Golden Immortal, and Xuan Yuan Jie... was a bit too confident." Meng Yuan replied, hesitating for a moment.

"Do you know that Feng Qing Shui almost died at his hands earlier, and there was no Devouring Golden Immortal to help him?" Zhu Yan's eyes flashed with a hint of mockery.
