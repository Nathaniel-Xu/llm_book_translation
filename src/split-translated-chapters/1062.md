Wu Chao Ghost King was dressed in a scholarly attire, his hand clenched into a claw, and a dark, palm-sized prison appeared in his palm, emitting electric sparks and crackling sounds. The thirty-six Qingtong Bee Cloud Swords were trapped inside, struggling and colliding with each other, but no matter how hard they tried, they couldn't break free from the prison's shackles.

"You're really patient, taking half a day to finally show yourself," Han Li said, not looking at the swords, but instead asking.

"Earlier, I felt a presence that was quite detestable yet made me wary. I couldn't determine what it was, and I thought it might be on those two people. Now, it seems it's on you. Not bad, not bad!" Wu Chao Ghost King looked at Han Li and chuckled.

"Are you talking about my Thunderbolt Annihilation Technique? You already have it in your hand, don't you?" Han Li feigned surprise and asked.

"This Thunderbolt Annihilation Technique is indeed troublesome, but it's not enough to make me wary. I've cultivated for so long, and I've seen all sorts of great winds and waves. I've killed countless Heavenly Messenger Sages," Wu Chao Ghost King said, raising an eyebrow.

As soon as he finished speaking, a strange phenomenon appeared behind Han Li. A narrow slit suddenly tore open in the air, and a dense, black mist poured out. Numerous ghostly hands and claws emerged, instantly blocking Han Li's retreat and grabbing at him.

Han Li's body didn't move, and a strange sound echoed from his body. Countless golden electric threads burst forth, covering him like a golden armor.

The ghostly hands touched the golden threads and immediately retreated, emitting black smoke.

Han Li turned around, raised his fist, and punched the black mist.

His body's acupoints flashed with light, and a brilliant starlight burst forth from his fist, illuminating the black mist. The ghostly hands were like they were burned by the starlight, retreating back into the mist.

Wu Chao Ghost King saw this and smiled. He controlled the still-struggling Qingtong Bee Cloud Swords with one hand and clenched his other hand into a claw, grasping the air.

Han Li saw the narrow slit tear open again, and the black mist spread out like a tide. At the same time, Wu Chao Ghost King's body suddenly became illusory and disappeared.

The dense mist merged with the sky, and Han Li felt the surroundings darken, as if he had entered the night. The scenery around him disappeared, and even the sounds of the Heavenly Water Sect disciples and the ten Red Robe Ghost Generals fighting couldn't be heard.

He furrowed his brow, quickly circulating his Cultivation Technique, and sent out his divine sense to explore.

"Ah, how strange! You have the Thunderbolt Annihilation Technique, and you've also cultivated the Cultivation Technique. Your level is not low, but it's useless against me... I'm becoming more and more interested in you," Wu Chao Ghost King's voice suddenly came from the surroundings, sounding somewhat ethereal.

"What's going on?" Han Li's brow furrowed in surprise.

Using his Cultivation Technique, he couldn't even detect Wu Chao Ghost King's exact location.

At this moment, a strange fluctuation appeared in the air around Han Li, and a blood-red light emerged. A figure of Wu Chao Ghost King condensed, and it was as if there were dozens of him, all with the same aura and releasing the same cultivation fluctuations, which were all at the Great Luo level.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he scanned the Wu Chao Ghost Kings, discovering that they all had the same aura. They moved simultaneously, dispersing in all directions, and surrounded Han Li from all sides.

The blood-red light on their bodies flashed, and they began to chant, releasing a series of strange, ancient symbols. These symbols floated in the air, forming a circle around Han Li.

Each symbol had a blood-red glow, and a ghostly head emerged from each one, opening its mouth in a silent roar. A dark red light shot out from each mouth, enveloping Han Li.

Han Li felt his body stiffen, and his blood seemed to freeze. His cultivation and stellar force stopped circulating.

At the same time, a blood-red wave surged in his mind, and a figure of Wu Chao Ghost King, condensed from blood, stepped forward, walking towards the depths of his mind.

Wherever the figure walked, Han Li's mind was invaded by the blood-red color.

Han Li's heart was shocked. Since he had cultivated the Cultivation Technique, when had he been so easily broken through, allowing someone to invade his mind?

His divine sense manifested in his mind, using all his strength to circulate the Cultivation Technique, and formed a strong barrier to resist the invasion.
"No need to resist, my Soul-Seeking Technique is something that even ordinary Da Luo Realm cultivators can't withstand, why bother?" Wu Zuo Gui Wang, the Blood Shadow Bookworm, spoke in his raspy voice, which echoed within Han Li's mind.

"Uu Zuo Gui Wang, I have something I don't understand, can you enlighten me, so I can die with a clear conscience?" Han Li's divine soul didn't respond directly, instead asking a question.

"If it were anyone else, I wouldn't deign to answer, but since your divine soul is so strong, it can help me break through my cultivation, I'll make an exception and let you die with a clear conscience." The Blood Shadow Bookworm stopped in his tracks and responded.

"It's said that Uu Zuo Gui Wang was suppressed in the Heavenly Court's Divine Prison, why are you here?" Han Li asked.

"I thought you'd ask why your Refining Spirit Technique couldn't withstand my Soul-Seeking Technique, but instead, you asked this... it's really... never mind, I'll tell you anyway. The former master of the Divine Prison was the Tai Sui Immortal, who guarded the prison for millions of years. Later, he betrayed the Heavenly Court and escaped, and before leaving, he tricked me into coming out and imprisoned me here." Wu Zuo Gui Wang replied with a hint of reminiscence.

"Originally, I had no idea you had such a past, no wonder this Years Tower is so treacherous... it seems we're not here to seek treasure, but to throw ourselves into a trap... " Han Li smiled wryly, his hands hidden in his sleeves, but secretly forming a seal.

"You only thought you were seeking treasure, but in reality, you entered a place of death, otherwise, I wouldn't have stayed here for so many years. Even if I didn't kill you, you'd never be able to escape this tower, so why not let me help you find release, at least you'll have a chance to reincarnate... I'm actually being too kind, having read so many sacred scriptures, my conscience is still intact." Wu Zuo Gui Wang sighed lightly.

"I have one more question, can your divine soul withstand the Thunder of the Evil-Extinguishing God?" Han Li suddenly smiled, asking a question.

As soon as he finished speaking, the entire realm of his mind was suddenly filled with a surge of golden light, countless golden lightning bolts erupted from the surroundings, instantly engulfing his entire realm.

A series of electric explosions echoed through Han Li's mind, and the Blood Shadow Bookworm was submerged in the lightning, instantly disappearing, and the surrounding blood-red color retreated and dissipated.

Along with this, Han Li's mind was shaken violently, and even he felt a sharp, tearing pain, his divine soul suffering a significant injury.

The evil ghost skulls surrounding him cracked and shattered.

Han Li gritted his teeth, enduring the intense pain in his mind, and looked forward, seeing that among the dozens of Wu Zuo Gui Wang's figures, one of them had a golden light appearing in the center of his palm.

He quickly raised his hand and swung it in that direction, and a silver light flashed, followed by the appearance of the Crying Soul, which darted towards that direction.

As soon as it appeared, the Crying Soul didn't hesitate, and its body was surrounded by a black glow, instantly transforming into its true form as a demonic beast.

It grew to over a hundred feet tall, its body a massive, black ape, its fur standing on end like steel needles, its eyes glowing red, and its brow splitting open to reveal a third, blood-red eye. Three black, bony spikes protruded from its back, and its entire body radiated a dark, oppressive aura.

The Wu Zuo Gui Wang, whose divine soul had been severely damaged by the Thunder of the Evil-Extinguishing God, was shocked and enraged, never having expected Han Li to possess such a powerful technique, and even more astonished that he would release it within his own realm.

He struggled to stabilize his divine soul, and when he looked up, he saw his arch-nemesis suddenly appear before him, and for a moment, he was flustered.

Han Li took advantage of the opportunity, his hands forming a sword seal, and with a loud, thunderous sound, the thirty-six Qing Zhuo Cloud Swords, which had been sealed by Wu Zuo Gui Wang, burst forth, flying towards him in a flash of golden light.

Han Li looked at the flying swords, their golden light somewhat dimmed, and quickly stored them in the Xuan Tian Gourd to nurture them.

He glanced at the Crying Soul, which was already engaged in battle with Wu Zuo Gui Wang, and felt a wave of dizziness wash over him, his body swaying, and he quickly sat down in the lotus position.

"It seems the damage is worse than I thought..."

Han Li sighed inwardly, his hand flipping over to retrieve a pill to repair his divine soul, which he quickly swallowed, and began to meditate.

Currently, the Crying Soul's strength had not fully recovered, and facing the Da Luo-level Wu Zuo Gui Wang, although it had a natural advantage, the difference in strength was too great, and the outcome was uncertain.

Furthermore, they were in Wu Zuo Gui Wang's spiritual realm, and he had the advantage of being on home turf, so Han Li had to quickly stabilize his divine soul to help the Crying Soul, or they would be at a disadvantage.

With this thought, Han Li focused on refining the pill, calming his mind, and meditating.
