Han Li easily deflected the crystal sword energies, but others were not so fortunate.

The spherical light shield surrounding the Lan siblings was sliced open with a "hiss" sound, revealing a series of cracks.

The light shield's blue light flashed wildly, and it seemed on the verge of collapse, with hints of blood visible within.

The siblings' faces changed dramatically, and they quickly formed hand seals, causing their bodies to flash with blue light. A series of blue crystal threads shot out from their bodies, merging with the light shield.

The light shield suddenly stabilized, stubbornly resisting the sword energies' attack. At the same time, it retreated backward, flashing out of the plaza's range and into the outside.

Inside the shield, Lan Yuanzi's arm was severed at the elbow, and Lan Yan's shoulder had a deep sword wound. Their faces were filled with shock and fear.

The crystal sword energies' power far exceeded their expectations. Luckily, they had used the Eight Dragon Water Pearl, a defensive treasure they had been saving. Otherwise, they would have been killed on the spot.

The white light shield in front of Huo San and Jiao San was also sliced open, revealing cracks. It seemed on the verge of shattering.

In a critical moment, Jiao San placed his hands on the shield, and two dark red glows burst forth from his palms, forming a dark red light shield. A powerful, cyclical force surged within.

Although the dark red light shield seemed thin, it was exceptionally resilient, firmly resisting the sword energies' attack.

However, the two did not retreat, their eyes fixed intently on the golden altar.

On the other side, the golden light array surrounding Lei Yu Ce and his companions was struck by the sword energies. Lei Yu Ce and Wen Zhong simultaneously chanted incantations, their hands moving rapidly as they formed a series of colorful seals, pouring them into the golden light array.

The golden light array suddenly produced a hundred-zhang-tall golden sword shadow, which vibrated intensely. The crystal sword energies that entered the array immediately submitted, swirling around the golden sword shadow before being absorbed into it.

"Where's Xiong Shan?" Han Li's brow furrowed, his eyes scanning the surroundings.

Xiong Shan, who was closest to the golden ancient sword, shouldn't have been killed already?

But the next scene made Han Li's eyes widen in surprise.

Xiong Shan's body was enveloped in a golden light, his entire being transformed into a golden mist. A sword intent like clouds and mist emanated from him.

Sword energies sliced through his body, but seemed to cause no harm.

"What kind of secret art is this?" Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he soon discovered that the sword energies had indeed caused harm.

Each sword energy that sliced through Xiong Shan's golden mist reduced it slightly.

However, contrary to everyone's expectations, Xiong Shan did not retreat. Instead, his golden mist surged forward, and he continued to charge toward the golden ancient sword. In an instant, he was within ten zhang of the sword.

The golden flame beside the ancient sword suddenly flared up, its size increasing by threefold. It began to churn violently, emitting a shrill whistling sound.

Golden flames shot out from the flame, merging with the ancient sword's sword energies. The crystal sword energies were now shrouded in a faint golden flame, transforming into flame sword energies.

With a loud "Boom!"

The flame sword energies surged violently, their power increasing several times over. The original crystal sword energies had only enveloped the altar's surroundings, but now the flame sword energies had expanded to cover a radius of nearly a thousand zhang.

Xiong Shan's golden mist was immediately enveloped by the flame sword energies, churning violently as it rapidly shrunk. Pained cries echoed from within.

Huo San and Jiao San, as well as Lei Yu Ce, were also engulfed by the flame sword energies. Soon, angry roars and cries of alarm echoed from within, but it was unclear what was happening.

Han Li and the Lan siblings had already retreated to a safe distance. As the sword energies surged, they were once again drawn into the fray.

Flame sword energies sliced through the sword curtain surrounding Han Li, causing the golden sword curtain to shatter. The thirty-six Qing bamboo swords were like falling leaves in a storm, spinning wildly as they were blown away.

The flame sword energies sliced through the golden sword array, striking Han Li's body.

Han Li's Zhen Ji membrane glowed intensely, its surface cracked and torn. The membrane, which had previously been able to withstand the crystal sword energies, now had deep sword wounds, with some areas pierced through.

Han Li could no longer hold back, and his hands quickly formed a seal.

A low hum filled the air as the Zhen Yan treasure wheel appeared behind him, its surface covered in dense, swirling patterns. The flame sword energies were enveloped, slowing down but not stopping.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he gazed at the golden flame on the sword energies. Suddenly, he understood, and his hands changed the seal once more.

The Zhen Yan treasure wheel's side flashed with golden light, and the Duan Shi fire stick appeared, its surface extending a flame-shaped golden light. This formed a golden domain, the Duan Shi fire boundary.

The Duan Shi fire stick's time crystal threads increased explosively, and the Duan Shi fire boundary's power surged. Everything within its range was completely frozen, rivaling the power of Qi Mo's Duan Shi fire boundary.
The flames and sword energy were finally halted by the Time Boundary. 

Just then, a loud noise came from the side, and it was from the two Blue Primal Sons. 

The noise had yet to subside when a massive blue sun burst forth, radiating blue light that wildly swept out in all directions. 

Eight blue dragons shot out from the sun, their jaws wide open as they pounced on the flames and sword energy, momentarily blocking them. 

Taking advantage of the brief moment, two figures shot out from the blue sun, appearing far away. The Blue Primal Sons' faces were deathly pale, their injuries more numerous than before, with fresh blood dripping from their wounds. They looked disheveled and hastily took out medicinal pellets to treat their injuries. 

Han Li glanced at the two and immediately withdrew his gaze, focusing on the ancient sword and golden flames at the top of the altar. His eyes sparkled with excitement. 

The golden ancient sword was a divine artifact of the Golden Law, while the golden flames contained the Time Law. The two laws could be combined, and their power was astonishingly strong. 

His Qingtong Bee Cloud Sword could combine with the Time Law before it was born with the Thunder Law, but after it transformed into a divine artifact, it was no longer compatible with the Time Law. 

If his Qingtong Bee Cloud Sword could combine with the Time Law, its power would be incredible. 

Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he thought of this. He raised his hand, and the Qingtong Bee Cloud Sword flew back into his sleeve. 

Then, he moved, flying towards the altar with the True Word Treasure Wheel and the Time Boundary. 

Just as he did, the black wind surging out of the crack in the altar suddenly intensified, enveloping the entire cave in a dark, icy wind. The dense flames and sword energy around the altar were unable to block it. 

A series of mournful wails echoed through the cave, and the air was filled with the sound of rushing sand and stone. 

Han Li's expression changed, and he halted his flight. 

The ancient sword and golden flames on the altar flashed again, and the golden law array on the altar began to wildly flash. The sword energy shooting out from the array suddenly contracted, no longer attacking Han Li and the others. Instead, it focused on the crack in the altar. 

"It's too late now!" a cold, mirthless laugh came from the crack, followed by a surge of dark energy. 

A massive black lightning bolt burst forth from the crack, piercing through the sword energy and striking the golden flames. 

At the same time, a brilliant golden light flashed amidst the dense sword energy, and a fierce sword intent burst forth, creating a gap in the sword energy. 

A thin, golden mist shot out from the gap, entering the hole created by the black lightning bolt. It then shot forward, its timing impeccable. 

However, this all happened in the blink of an eye, and the golden mist was not noticeable, so no one saw it. 

Han Li and the others only saw a brilliant black lightning bolt pierce through the sword energy, striking the golden flames on the altar. 

A deafening explosion shook the air, and the black and golden lights burst forth, causing the surrounding space to distort and tremble. 

The golden flames violently shook, and then, with a loud crack, they were severed from the Taiji diagram below, flying out in a different direction. 

The flames happened to be flying towards Han Li, who was overjoyed. He quickly formed a hand seal, and several time law crystals shot out from the Time Boundary, wrapping around the golden flames. He then pulled them back towards himself. 

To his surprise, the golden flames did not resist or struggle, and they were easily pulled back to his side. 

At the same time, the thin golden mist flew to the top of the altar, transforming into a figure - it was Xiong Shan. 

Han Li's eyes widened in shock as he saw Xiong Shan's appearance. He was covered in wounds, with no blood flowing from them. His legs and left arm were gone, leaving only a wounded right arm. 

The golden ancient sword was still radiating brilliant sword energy, and Xiong Shan's body was pierced by countless holes, his flesh on the verge of collapse. 

However, he didn't flinch, his eyes fixed on the golden ancient sword. He stretched out his remaining right arm, grasping the sword hilt, and then pulled upwards. 

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed in concern. The black lightning bolt had barely managed to dislodge the golden flames, and Xiong Shan's condition was dire. It seemed unlikely that he could pull out the golden ancient sword. 

But then, something unexpected happened!
