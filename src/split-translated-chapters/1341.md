Here is the translation of the chapter:

“Jintong…… you're referring to Qulin, aren't you? What's your relationship with her?” Xuan Yuan Jie asked, somewhat surprised.

“She's my spirit pet,” Han Li replied calmly.

“Daring rebel, how dare you claim the Bug Ancestor as your spirit pet?” Yi Zhen's face turned red with rage, shouting out in rebuke.

“You should focus on recovering from your injuries. I can hold off Xuan Yuan Jie alone, but if the others attack together, I won't be able to intercept them all.” Han Li turned his body slightly, speaking in a calm tone.

Yi Zhen looked at Han Li's ordinary face, feeling a slight disappointment. After all, Han Li's back figure had been incredibly striking in the previous moment.

Han Li finished speaking and turned back, once again showing his back to Yi Zhen.

Yi Zhen gazed at Han Li's back, sensing the increasingly powerful aura emanating from him. His heart was shocked: “What kind of person is he, with such a strong temporal law fluctuation within him?”

“Enough, I'm also asking unnecessary questions. Since you've delivered yourself to my doorstep, I'll take you down as well, as a bonus for this trip.” Xuan Yuan Jie sneered, speaking in a slow and deliberate tone.

Han Li didn't respond, his palm waving as his aura surged again. A golden light screen expanded instantly, transforming into a massive temporal spirit domain that enveloped the surrounding area of several tens of thousands of miles.

The Heavenly Court cultivators, who had retreated to the sides, felt as if they were trapped in a quagmire, unable to move.

Except for Yin Wushuang and the other two, only a small portion of the cultivators could maintain their freedom of movement, albeit at a significantly slower pace.

“Allowing you to cultivate the power of temporal laws to this extent, what is the Ancient or the Present doing?” Xuan Yuan Jie's face remained calm, but his heart was filled with shock.

However, this only strengthened his determination to eliminate Han Li.

With a wave of his hand, the entire suspended continent charged towards Han Li like a warship.

Han Li saw this and suddenly pinched his sword fingers, causing the 72 Qingtong Huanyu swords to transform into sword lights that enveloped the rolling thunder and lightning, shooting towards Xuan Yuan Jie.

Xuan Yuan Jie's hands clasped together, and two yellow light screens appeared in front of him. All the flying swords, upon touching the yellow light, were easily deflected without even releasing their lightning energy.

“Just this level of ability, yet...” Xuan Yuan Jie's words were cut off as he saw Han Li's figure charging towards him with an extraordinary speed.

Xuan Yuan Jie's heart was filled with joy, thinking that Han Li was using brute force to resist his temporal law, which was equivalent to using an egg to strike a rock. If Han Li dared to use this foolish method to collide with him, he would have the opportunity to destroy him with a single blow.

However, Han Li was not a fool.

As they were about to collide, a lightning flash appeared on Han Li's body, and his figure vanished in an instant.

In the next moment, one of the Qingtong Huanyu swords that had been deflected by Xuan Yuan Jie flashed with electricity, and Han Li reappeared, standing on the flying sword.

“Too fast!” Xuan Yuan Jie turned around, his eyes flashing with a serious expression.

Han Li's sudden movement seemed to be related to the flying swords that contained the power of lightning laws, rather than the temporal law technique.

Han Li arrived at Xuan Yuan Jie's location on the suspended continent, his hands pointing together as he drew a golden light that contained the power of temporal laws. The light transformed into a massive wave that swept across half of the continent.

The raging yellow earth waves on the continent were covered by the temporal law power, and the dust and smoke dissipated, almost coming to a standstill. The two cultivators, Feng Bai and Qing Feng, who had been trapped, took advantage of the situation to break free and rise into the air.

“Leave this to me, go protect Qulin...” Han Li said, his back to the two cultivators.

Qing Feng and Feng Bai exchanged a glance, although they were still uneasy about Han Li's previous words. However, they had no choice but to acknowledge him and flew towards Jintong.

Yin Wushuang and the other two cultivators attacked Jintong, entangling themselves with Yi Zhen and the other two.

As for the Heavenly Court cultivators, only a few could resist the power of Han Li's temporal domain, and they remained trapped in their original positions.

“Thinking you're a Dao Ancestor just because you're a Da Luo? ” Xuan Yuan Jie let out a long laugh, his hand waving.

The continent beneath Han Li's feet lit up with a yellow glow, and a powerful attractive force emanated from it, holding his legs in place.

Xuan Yuan Jie then raised his hand, and a massive attractive force pulled the continent towards him.

“Rumble, rumble...”

A loud rumbling sound echoed from the depths of the void, and hundreds of meteorites of various sizes and shapes descended towards Han Li, fueled by a powerful force.

The friction generated by the meteorites ignited flames on their surfaces, creating a breathtaking spectacle of fire and stars.

However, these meteorites were enhanced by Xuan Yuan Jie's earth attribute laws, increasing their power by a hundredfold.
Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and the Heavenly Executioner's Prison Seal technique circulated within his body, causing the 1,800 acupoints on his body to light up simultaneously. He suddenly raised his leg and pulled it out of the yellow glow on the ground.

Xuanyuan Jie saw this and furrowed his eyebrows, immediately forming a hand seal and clapping his hands together in front of him.

"Boom, boom, boom..."

As a result, the two sides of the floating continent rapidly churned, and the originally flat terrain suddenly bulged into two mountain peaks that clashed towards the center.

Han Li had just freed one leg, but was heavily sandwiched between the two mountain peaks.

A thunderous sound shook the sky!

The entire floating continent shook violently, and the two mountain peaks that had collided almost simultaneously collapsed and fell to one place.

"This is not good..." Yi Xiu looked at the battlefield, where smoke and dust rose, and sighed.

Although she didn't know the true relationship between Han Li and Jintong, she knew that Han Li was there to help her insect ancestor, and seeing him being suppressed by Xuanyuan Jie made her anxious.

Just as she was worrying, a terrifying spatial rift opened in the sky above the continent, and meteorites came crashing down, causing a series of explosions.

"Boom, boom, boom..."

The entire floating continent was almost submerged in the meteorite fire rain, and the intense explosions continued for dozens of breaths.

When the sound stopped, all the mountains and terrain on the continent were flattened by the powerful force, and the land was scarred and pockmarked.

Xuanyuan Jie glanced at the scene, satisfied with his own work, and turned to leave.

But just as he was about to go, his eyebrows suddenly furrowed, and he turned back.

He saw that on the ruined continent, the ground was shaking violently, and a majestic figure slowly rose from the charred earth. The three large True Spirit heads turned left and right, and the six arms shook, casting off the dust.

"Magic tribe's body refinement technique..." Xuanyuan Jie's eyes narrowed, saying.

"This stone isn't hard enough, try my fist instead." Han Li's three heads spoke in unison, saying.

As soon as he finished speaking, the Great Five Elements Fantasy World technique circulated within his body, and he took a step forward, forming a seemingly casual fist stance. His six arms all drew back, storing up energy.

At the same time, the power of the five attributes' time laws began to condense rapidly, and his body began to radiate five-colored light, which merged into one.

"This kid has actually cultivated the power of time laws to this extent?" Xuanyuan Jie's expression changed.

He also felt that Han Li's current move was extraordinary, and his heart couldn't help but become cautious. He immediately closed his eyes and formed a hand seal in front of him.

As his eyes closed, a yellow light began to spread from his body, extending into the void and disappearing.

Along with this, a strange aura began to emanate from his body.

Han Li, who was concentrating on launching an attack, was attracted to this aura and couldn't help but look at Xuanyuan Jie.

At this moment, Xuanyuan Jie seemed to be in a state of fusion with the void, giving Han Li a sense of confusion, as if he was both present and absent.

He was the body of the Dao Ancestor, and also the manifestation of the Great Dao.

"Is this the state of being after achieving the Great Dao?" Han Li's heart was slightly moved, thinking.

But this was not the time for sentiment, and his eyes suddenly narrowed. The power of the five time laws had already condensed, and his body began to radiate a black aura.

On his back, the light of the time laws' manifestation, the True Word Treasure Wheel, began to appear, distributing itself in a circular pattern and radiating a dazzling golden light.

"Break for me!"

Han Li's voice boomed, and the six arms' spiritual energy surged, casting out six massive fists that transformed into countless golden and black fist shadows, crashing towards the front.

The fist shadows flashed rapidly in the void, almost instantly appearing in front of Xuanyuan Jie.

At the critical moment, Xuanyuan Jie's tightly closed eyes suddenly opened, revealing a pair of eyes without pupils, only a yellow glow, which seemed empty but contained infinite power.

"The power of the Great Dao, can it be broken by your brute force?" Xuanyuan Jie's voice was low and calm.

He raised one hand, slowly pushing forward, and the void in front of him shook violently.

A vortex appeared in his palm, and a massive golden wall condensed, pushing forward with a loud rumbling sound.
