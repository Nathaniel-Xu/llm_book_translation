"Master, your aura..." Ti Hu cried out, looking Han Li up and down before transmitting her voice once more.

"I've also noticed, my aura is quite unstable. The Zhan Shi Xian Symbol isn't just used to split apart evil corpse spirits, but it also promotes my cultivation to a certain extent. However, my current state is quite strange... apart from the 460 immortal apertures I originally opened, there are now 380 apertures in a half-open, half-closed state." Han Li sighed and replied.

His current situation was unclear, but he vaguely felt it was the power of the Zhan Shi Xian Symbol that forcibly opened his immortal apertures to 840.

Because 840 immortal apertures was the threshold to enter the mid-Daluo stage, it was also the foundation for separating evil corpses. However, his current state was as if one leg had crossed the threshold, while the other leg was still firmly stuck outside, making his situation quite awkward.

"However, Master, your cultivation seems to have increased significantly compared to before." Ti Hu said.

Lan Yan was still feeling anxious, but upon seeing Han Li wake up and hearing his words, her heart unexpectedly calmed down.

"Master, what do we do next? That Qu Lin seems to be searching for the Golden Child as well. Should we chase after him, or..." Ti Hu hesitated before asking.

Han Li's mind was also filled with indecision, his expression sank into thought.

"Master, I feel the aura of the old master. Let me out quickly." Just then, Xiao Bai's voice echoed in Han Li's mind.

Han Li's face lit up with joy, and he raised his hand, releasing Xiao Bai.

Xiao Bai transformed into a large, several-zhang-tall Pi Xiu and appeared, immediately using its nose to sniff the air.

"This way." It flew off, its four legs flailing as it rushed towards the depths of the collapsed underground space.

Han Li brought Ti Hu and Lan Yan along, hastily following after Xiao Bai.

The stone door was already half-destroyed, and it was unclear whether it was damaged during the intense battle earlier.

Xiao Bai's body flashed, and it flew through the half-destroyed stone door.

Han Li and the others followed closely behind.

Behind the stone door was another passageway, but it wasn't very long. The group quickly reached the end.

At the end of the passageway was another tightly closed stone door.

The stone door emitted a dark, metallic luster, giving off an impression of being unbreakable. The stone door also had a layer of dense, black light on top, with countless, worm-like symbols writhing within, forming a complex spell array.

Xiao Bai opened its mouth and shot out a beam of white light, which struck the stone door. The symbols on the door frantically rolled about, but the stone door only shook violently, its black spell array severely disrupted.

The stone door released a circle of black light, but it firmly resisted the white light's impact.

Xiao Bai's brow furrowed, and it was about to attack again.

Han Li had already caught up from behind and, without hesitation, flicked his fingers.

Seven or eight golden sword energies shot out, each flashing with golden lightning arcs, and exploded with a shocking display of thunderous might, striking the stone door.

A series of deafening booms echoed, and the stone door's spell array was easily torn apart.

The stone door behind was also blasted open, transforming into a pile of rubble.

Han Li's eyes lit up with joy upon seeing this.

His 300-plus immortal apertures, which were half-open and half-closed, had increased his absorption of heaven and earth's origin energy. The might of the Qing Yun Bee Cloud Sword had also greatly increased, and it could be said that his misfortune had turned into good fortune.

"Let's go." Han Li called out to the others, continuing forward.

The space ahead of them suddenly opened up, and another dark, cyan-colored stone room appeared.

This stone room was smaller than the previous underground space, but it was filled with various objects and wasn't empty.

In the center of the stone room was a large, nine-palace-shaped spell array, with a black jade crystal coffin placed in the center. It was unclear what it was used for.

The stone room's surroundings had seven or eight smaller rooms, each with a unique layout, giving off the appearance of a cave dwelling.

"Could this be the lair of the Gui Lingzi?" Han Li's eyes swept the area, his mind filled with speculation.

However, Ti Hu didn't pay attention to anything else, her eyes fixed on the black crystal coffin within the spell array, a strange, faint glow appearing in her eyes.

"The old master's aura is coming from here." Xiao Bai flew to the front of a room, its paw pushing open the door.

The stone door was easily pushed open, and there were no restrictions on it.

Han Li and Lan Yan hastily flew over, landing in front of the room.

The room's interior was quite spacious, with a large, crystal cage placed in the center. The cage was a dazzling white, clearly made from a special type of precious jade.

The cage had spiritual lines engraved on it, and several symbols were attached to it, clearly used to restrain something.
The cage's corner had a large hole, the edges were uneven, as if it had been bitten open by teeth.

"This..." Xiao Bai saw the scene in front of him and was momentarily stunned.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he crouched down beside the broken cage, rubbing his fingers on the broken edge.

"There's no mistake, the residual aura on the broken edge is indeed Jin Tong's... It seems she was previously imprisoned here. But from the looks of it, Jin Tong should have bitten through the cage and escaped. And the bite marks are quite new, it should be a recent event." Han Li placed his finger on his brow, sensing the aura, and frowned.

"Since Jin Tong has already escaped, we can't track her..." Lan Yan said with some concern.

"We can't sense Jin Tong, but we can track that Qi Lin." Han Li said slowly.

"That's right, Qi Lin just left, there should be some residual aura left behind, let's go chase after him." Xiao Bai's face lit up with excitement, and he turned to fly back the way they came.

"Wait a minute, this seems to be Gui Lingzi's lair, since we're here, we can't just leave empty-handed." Han Li stretched out his hand to grab Xiao Bai, looking around at the other rooms in the stone chamber, and smiled.

"As expected, Master is clever, Gui Lingzi dared to capture our leader, we'll just destroy his lair." Xiao Bai heard this and laughed maniacally.

Before he finished speaking, he flew to a nearby room and kicked the door open with a loud crash.

The stone door of this room had a restriction, but it wasn't very strong, apparently Gui Lingzi hadn't expected anyone to dare to come to his lair to cause trouble. The door was kicked open by Xiao Bai.

Lan Yan also flew to a room, shooting out a blue light that crashed into the door.

Han Li flashed to another room, flicking his fingers.

A golden sword aura shot out, breaking the door.

This room was quite large, about 20-30 zhang in size, with wooden shelves placed inside, holding various mineral materials.

"Jin Yinwen stone, Huaxue crystal, Guang Ling jade..." Han Li's gaze swept over the shelves, and his eyes lit up.

These materials were of extremely high quality, even surpassing his own collection, and the quantity was also very considerable. For him, who was currently worried about how to obtain a large batch of xian yuan stones, this was a timely windfall.

Han Li waved his hands, and two streams of blue light shot out, wrapping around the materials, along with the shelves, and storing them in the Huaji space.

The situation was urgent, so he quickly gathered the materials, and after a few breaths, he had finished collecting everything in the room. Then he turned to another room, waving his hand to blast open the door.

This room had a golden dan furnace, about the size of a person, in an octagonal shape. Although the furnace wasn't being used, it still emitted a shocking aura.

The room only had the dan furnace, nothing else. It seemed to be a dan-making room.

Gui Lingzi had just tried to kill him, so Han Li naturally wouldn't be polite to him. Moreover, this dan furnace looked quite extraordinary, and selling it would be worth a lot of xian yuan stones.

Han Li waved his hand again, shooting out a blue light that wrapped around the dan furnace, storing it in the Huaji space. Then he came to the third room.

This room was quite small, with only a stone table, covered by a black light screen.

On the table were a dozen or so fist-sized black crystal balls, each containing jumping black flames. Even through the light screen, one could feel the shocking aura of the black flames.

"Xuan Yin Shen Lei! There are over a dozen of them!" A voice came from behind Han Li, and it was Lan Yan, who had walked over with a look of surprise.

"Xuan Yin Shen Lei?" Han Li glanced at Lan Yan.

"Xuan Yin Shen Lei is a unique yin thunder technique created by Gui Lingzi, its power is enormous, enough to threaten even a Da Luo initial stage cultivator. Fortunately, Gui Lingzi didn't bring these thunderbolts with him, or we would have been in real danger." Lan Yan's face was filled with a lingering fear.

Han Li's eyes lit up when he heard this, and then he flicked his fingers. A golden lightning bolt struck the black light screen on the stone table, easily shattering it.

However, at this moment, the dozen or so black crystal balls suddenly burst out with dazzling black light, and the black flames inside the balls also showed a tendency to explode.

Han Li's face changed, and he was about to cast a spell to suppress them.

Just then, a black light flew out from behind, spreading out to cover the dozen or so black crystal balls.

A power of the law fluctuated within the black light, and the black flames inside the balls immediately stabilized.

"These thunderbolts haven't been fully refined, Master's Dantian Shen Lei is the nemesis of all yin attributes, it's easy to stimulate these thunderbolts to explode." Ti Huan had walked over, saying.

"Since that's the case, these Xuan Yin Shen Lei will be left to you to take care of." Han Li said calmly.

Ti Huan heard this and her body trembled, then a look of excitement appeared on her face: "Thank you, Master."

After saying this, she quickly formed a hand seal, and the black light wrapped around the Xuan Yin Shen Lei flew back to her.

Ti Huan muttered to herself, her hands moving rapidly as she formed a seal.

The dozen or so black crystal balls gained an additional layer of black light, as if they had been coated with a layer of thick lacquer, and the black flames inside the balls finally stabilized, flying into her sleeve.

Xiao Bai had also flown over, and had transformed into human form, his face filled with a smile.

The other rooms in the stone chamber had their doors broken, and it was clear that everything inside had been plundered.
