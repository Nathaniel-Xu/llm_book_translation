At this moment, Han Li also brought out twelve blue flying knives, which transformed into twelve giant knife auras in mid-air, emitting a strong yin-killer aura.

The air where the flying knives passed through was filled with a layer of frost, and a heart-piercing whistling sound was heard, slashing towards the Fire Age Worm King.

These twelve blue evil flying knives were found in Dongfang Bai's storage artifact, with extraordinary power, and Han Li had been refining them for years, incorporating them into his body.

The Fire Age Worm King's eyes flashed with a hint of ridicule, and the red flames on its body flashed, and a large piece of red flames shot out from its body, which was the flames of the ages. With a flick, a red fire sea formed around its body in an instant.

As everyone saw this scene, their faces changed, and they pinched their fingers to retrieve their artifacts, but it was too late.

The colorful artifacts slashed into the red fire sea, and they disappeared like a mud cow entering the sea, without any unusual movements.

The next moment, the connection between the people and the artifacts was severed, and their faces changed.

Su Zhongxi and Jin Liu looked at each other, and both saw the color of retreat in each other's eyes.

Although the three beehives were extremely valuable, they were useless to their own cultivation, and even if they were obtained, they would be sold to others to exchange for a large amount of resources and wealth.

It was not a wise move to fight to the death with the extremely powerful Fire Age Worm King for this, even if they could win, they would have to pay a huge price, and may even lose their lives.

The others thought the same, and only Han Li and the loose cultivator with the golden hair, who held the Bao Yang Shen Mu tablet, seemed to have a hint of determination in their expressions.

Just as they were about to make a move, the red fire sea suddenly churned violently, and quickly shrunk into a house-sized red fireball, which shot out like a meteor.

Han Li saw this scene, and his eyes flashed with understanding, but he did nothing.

The others were stunned, and some didn't understand.

The people in front of the fireball quickly dodged, and the red fireball flashed and fell on the entrance of the tunnel above the lava.

"No! It's going to seal the tunnel!" Su Zhongxi's face changed, and she cried out in surprise.

Before she finished speaking, the red fireball flashed and turned into a red fire curtain, sealing the tunnel entrance.

Although there was another tunnel behind the cave, it was also a dead end, as countless Fire Age fireflies were flying inside.

The Fire Age Worm King's eyes flickered, and it seemed to be looking at everyone with a hint of mockery, like a cat playing with a mouse.

The people present changed their faces, and some of the timid ones turned pale.

"Humph! You think you can trap us here? Let's see if you have the ability! We have so many people, are we afraid of this insignificant worm?" Lian Dahan shouted, his body glowing with yellow light, and then he stomped his foot heavily.

A yellow spirit domain burst out from his body, covering the entire cave space.

A huge gravitational force emanated from the spirit domain, pulling towards the Fire Age Worm King, and the worm king's body immediately sank, its claws curved downwards.

"Not bad, with so many people, the law of superposition, we don't believe we can't kill this time worm king!" Jin Liu also shouted.

As he spoke, his body glowed with blue light, and he opened a blue spirit domain, covering the Fire Age Worm King.

The flames of the ages around the Fire Age Worm King's body immediately fluctuated, and it seemed that Jin Liu's spirit domain had an effect on it.

The others saw this scene, and their spirits were shocked, and they each deployed their spirit domains.

In an instant, more than a dozen spirit domains covered the Fire Age fireflies.

The Fire Age fireflies' eyes, which had been filled with mockery, had disappeared, replaced by a fierce light.

The red flames on its body flashed, and it shot out like a red shadow, pouncing on Lian Dahan.

With the influence of so many spirit domains, the Fire Age fireflies' speed, although still extremely fast, had slowed down compared to before, and no longer had that kind of ghostly might.

"Sand cage!" Lian Dahan quickly retreated, and at the same time, he grasped at the air with both hands.

The ground in the cave suddenly cracked, and countless stones and gravel flew out, rapidly entwining the Fire Age fireflies, forming a sand cage that trapped it.

Almost at the same time, in a series of sharp whistling sounds, several artifacts flew out, passing through the gaps in the sand cage, and hitting the Fire Age fireflies.

"Clang" "Clang" several crisp sounds, several artifacts were bounced back, and the Fire Age worm king's body didn't leave any marks, shocking everyone again.

Just as they were about to make a move, a blue light flashed, and a blue paper crane the size of a person's head appeared in front of the sand cage, its beak piercing through the cage, and striking the Fire Age worm king's body.

In the distance, Su Zhongxi muttered to herself, her hands forming a strange hand seal, and several blue paper cranes flew out, circling around her.

With a "puff" sound, a blood hole was immediately pecked out on the Fire Age worm king's body, and red blood gushed out.

The Fire Age worm king let out a furious scream, its eyes glowing with blood-red light, and its body also grew larger.

It swung its claws, and several half-moon-shaped lights shot out, larger than before, slashing in all directions.
The sand and dust around him seemed to shatter like tofu, easily broken.

The Fire Age Worm King immediately broke free, its dual wings spread wide, and in an instant, it transformed into a bloody, residual shadow, its speed faster than before, as if the surrounding spiritual realm's influence on it had suddenly disappeared. It shot towards Su Zhuo like lightning.

Su Zhuo's face changed, and she hastily retreated, simultaneously releasing the blue paper cranes around her, which transformed into blue shadows, pouncing on the Fire Age Worm King.

Although the blue paper cranes were fast, they were still far slower than the Fire Age Worm King. The worm king's body flashed, easily dodging the paper cranes, and with one swift motion, it appeared in front of Su Zhuo, its two front claws about to strike.

In that instant, the air beside the Fire Age Worm King rippled, and a golden fist shadow appeared, striking it with the force of a meteor.

The Fire Age Worm King's body was instantly knocked flying, rolling and tumbling forward.

Not far away, Han Li silently retracted his fist.

"Thanks!" Su Zhuo's face was pale, and she sent a voice transmission to Han Li, thanking him. Then, she hastily retreated, recalling the blue paper cranes, which circled around her.

The Fire Age Worm King stabilized its body, its body flashing with blood light. It glared at Han Li with extreme anger, its dual wings spread wide, and its body transformed into a bloody shadow, flying towards him.

Han Li didn't use his spiritual realm, nor did he dodge or retreat. His body surface erupted with dense, mysterious, and uncountable golden lights, and his fists shone with golden light, ready to face the worm king.

But at that moment, the Fire Age Worm King let out an angry, sharp cry, and its direction suddenly changed, flying towards the three beehives.

Two cultivators, taking advantage of the Fire Age Worm King being entangled by Han Li and the others, sneaked to the beehives, trying to collect them. They were the young man with the golden hair, holding the Bao Yang Divine Wood Stele, and another loose cultivator, a Golden Immortal.

Seeing the Fire Age Worm King flying towards them, the two cultivators' faces changed, and they hastily retreated.

But the Fire Age Worm King seemed to have been thoroughly enraged by the two cultivators' actions, its entire body's armor instantly turning blood red, and the flames of time on its body also turning blood red.

Its speed increased once again, and with one swift motion, it flew between the two cultivators, its two front claws flashing.

Two blood-red lights flashed, and the other loose cultivator, the Golden Immortal, was cut in half from head to toe, his divine soul and nascent soul unable to escape.

The young man with the golden hair used the Bao Yang Divine Wood Stele to block the attack, but the stele was cut in half with a "pu" sound.

The young man's heart ached, but he took advantage of the brief moment to retreat, avoiding being cut in half. However, his chest was still struck by the residual force, and a large wound appeared, with blood gushing out. His retreating figure stumbled.

The Fire Age Worm King spat out a blood-red flame, taking advantage of the momentary delay to pierce the young man's chest.

The young man's body "exploded" with a loud sound, immediately transforming into a blood-red fireball, burning fiercely, and turning into ashes in an instant.

Just as the Fire Age Worm King killed the young man and the other cultivator, a dazzling blue light suddenly appeared in the air above, taking advantage of the momentary delay to descend, enveloping the Fire Age Worm King.

Three thick, blue chains extended from the blue light, binding the Fire Age Worm King.

The three chains, although blue, emitted different laws of power, yet they complemented each other seamlessly. Even the Fire Age Worm King's abilities couldn't break free from the chains.

In the distance, the three people from the Tian Shui Sect stood in a triangular formation, forming a three-attribute formation. They simultaneously chanted, remotely controlling the three blue chains.

The Fire Age Worm King let out an angry, sharp cry, its body's flames of time burning fiercely, intensely striking the chains.

The chains quickly showed signs of burning, but the surrounding blue spiritual realm flashed, and a surge of laws of power transmitted from within, causing the chains to rapidly recover, maintaining a balance with the flames of time.

"Quickly kill it, we can't hold on for much longer!" Su Zhuo and the others, although they had suppressed the Fire Age Worm King, were trembling with exhaustion, their hands quivering as they spoke.

The others, hearing this, hastily took out various attacks, launching a barrage of strikes at the Fire Age Worm King.

The Fire Age Worm King's eyes flashed with a hint of panic, its body's flames of time burning fiercely, enveloping its entire body. At the same time, it let out a sharp cry.

The Fire Age Worms outside the cave seemed to have received an order, flying towards the cave.

But at that moment, a figure appeared at the entrance of the cave, Han Li's silhouette emerging. He waved his hands.

A blue light shot out from his hands, but it was a blue jade plate, rapidly expanding, transforming into a blue stone door, blocking the entrance.

This was a divine artifact refined from the Kunlan Crystal Jade, obtained from the storage artifact of the East White. Its quality was extraordinary.

The Fire Age Worms outside crashed into the blue stone door, causing it to vibrate intensely.

Han Li's expression turned solemn, and he pressed his hands on the stone door, causing a layer of golden light to appear.

However, even so, the blue stone door still vibrated intensely, and the Fire Age Worms' impact was like a tidal wave, crashing against the door. If Han Li's hands relaxed even slightly, the door would immediately show signs of being shaken open.
