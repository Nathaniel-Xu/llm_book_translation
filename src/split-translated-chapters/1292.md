Han Li

Just as Han Li was standing silently, a faint voice suddenly appeared in his ear, which was Zi Ling.

He was slightly moved, and his body shifted slightly.

"Don't move... or Shi Chuan Kong will suspect." Zi Ling's voice sounded again, slightly urgent.

"Do you have something to tell me?" Han Li didn't look at Zi Ling, pretending to be vigilant as he looked around, and replied in a transmitted voice.

"It's about our purpose for coming to the Underworld Realm, Shi Chuan Kong won't allow me to say it, so I can only tell you secretly." Zi Ling said.

"Oh, what purpose?" Han Li was also curious about the reason for the two of them coming here.

"We came to the Underworld Realm because there is a treasure of the Six Paths of Reincarnation, which is a heavenly treasure that can recall memories of past lives, and by fusing with one's own cultivation, it can greatly improve one's cultivation." Zi Ling said.

Han Li listened to this and his eyes flashed with a hint of surprise, but he didn't speak.

"I know it sounds unbelievable, but it's true, the Demon Domain has used this method to greatly improve their strength in the past, and even the previous generation of masters have said that such a thing exists, so they arranged for me and Shi Chuan Kong to enter the Underworld Realm to try our luck. This is a secret of the Night Sun Kingdom's royal family, so Shi Chuan Kong didn't tell you. Han Li, you're secretly following us, the Six Paths of Reincarnation will definitely be useful to you too." Zi Ling saw the surprise in Han Li's eyes and thought he didn't believe her, so she immediately transmitted her voice.

"Zi Ling, you misunderstood, I'm not disbelieving you, I've already heard about the Six Paths of Reincarnation, and we're on our way there too." Han Li replied in a transmitted voice.

This time, it was Zi Ling's turn to be surprised, and she quickly recovered her composure.

"You know about it, that's good, I've heard a lot about you in the Demon Domain, and now the Heavenly Court is issuing a warrant for your arrest, this opportunity is rare, you... you must seize it." Zi Ling reminded him.

Han Li's heart warmed, and he hesitated for a moment, but ultimately replied with a single sentence "I understand, you should rest and recover first."

"En." Zi Ling responded with a single sound, and her voice disappeared.

Han Li sighed lightly in his heart, and also put aside his thoughts, focusing on protecting the group.

Half an hour later, Zi Ling, Shi Chuan Kong, and Jin Tong opened their eyes and stood up.

"Let's wait for Han Dao friend." Shi Chuan Kong apologized with a smile.

"No problem, since everyone has rested, let's set off, we three are heading towards the Yellow Spring Great Marsh, and you?" Han Li asked with a smile.

"Yellow Spring Great Marsh..." Shi Chuan Kong hesitated.

"We heard that there's a treasure called the Six Paths of Reincarnation there, which can awaken memories of past lives and is said to be helpful for cultivation, it's very mysterious, so we want to take a look." Han Li said lightly.

"...so you already knew about the Six Paths of Reincarnation, I didn't need to hide it, I and Zi Ling are also going there, let's travel together." Shi Chuan Kong hesitated for a moment, and then smiled wryly.

Ti Hou and Jin Tong heard this and looked surprised, but didn't say anything, standing behind Han Li.

"That's really a coincidence, since we're all going to the same place, let's travel together, and we can look out for each other." Han Li nodded.

Then, the group flew out, heading towards the Yellow Spring Great Marsh.

...

At this moment, in a chaotic space, a massive city floated in the air, with towering buildings and wide, clean streets, not inferior to the Nine Yuan City or the Golden City.

Auras flashed, and people flowed like rivers on the streets, exceptionally prosperous.

These people were of all shapes and sizes, including humans, demons, beasts, and even ghosts and gray spirits, all living in harmony.

If the true immortals of the True Immortal Realm were to see this, they would be shocked.

In the center of the city, a massive, dark red castle stood tall, its atmosphere grand and majestic.

Inside the castle, countless ancient buildings stood, making it hard to take it all in.

The dark red castle was surrounded by high walls, and the cultivators outside didn't dare to approach, clearly a restricted area.

A dark red aura flew in from afar, directly entering the castle and landing in front of a grand hall, revealing a red-robed woman, who was Jiao San.

The grand hall's doors were open, and two yellow-robed guards stood at attention, bowing to Jiao San.

"Pay respects to the Young Master!"

Jiao San ignored them, walking directly into the grand hall.

The hall was dimly lit, with only two rows of fire basins on the walls, burning orange-red flames, casting flickering shadows.

The hall was empty, except for a high platform at the far end, but no one was sitting on it.

On the floor, a block of cyan jade stood, and a cyan-robed man stood beside it, holding a small knife, carving into the jade.

The carving was almost complete, and from the outline, it could be seen that the cyan-robed man was carving a woman.
Here is the translated text:

"Reporting to the Lord!" Jiao San looked at the blue-robed man and immediately bowed.

"Get up, how's the arrangement going?" The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth didn't turn around, continuing his carving, and asked casually.

"The Jin Yuan Xian Domain is being tightly pursued by the Jiuyuan Observatory and the Heavenly Court, I have withdrawn all the personnel who have been exposed, leaving only the deepest undercover agents. No matter how the Jiuyuan Observatory and the Heavenly Court search, they shouldn't be able to find them." Jiao San said.

"Although that's the case, we must still be fully prepared. Distribute the Suoyuan Dan to those people, and if they are exposed and die in battle, their souls will be immediately taken to the Underworld, and arrangements will be made for their reincarnation." The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth continued in a calm tone.

"Yes." Jiao San replied.

"That Han Li, where is he now? Has his whereabouts been discovered?" The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth continued to ask.

"I have ordered people to investigate all over, and Han Li was last seen in the Chuyu Xian Domain's Tihu Mountain, where he repelled the Heavenly Court's pursuers and then disappeared without a trace. No matter how much we investigate, we can't find him." Jiao San frowned.

"Ah, perhaps he's cultivating in seclusion?" The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth's voice rose.

"There's a possibility, I've increased the investigation efforts, and I'll try to find his whereabouts as soon as possible." Jiao San said.

"No need, Han Li's matter can be put on hold for now. Since he's seen Rusong, he won't be hiding forever, and he'll soon appear." The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth said.

"Lord, what is the relationship between Rusong and Han Li? Han Li seems to care about her very much?" Jiao San hesitated for a moment, curiously opening his mouth to ask.

"Rusong is Han Li's Dao companion from the lower realm." The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth stopped carving and said calmly.

"I see." Jiao San heard this and finally understood.

"You've been working hard for a while, go down and rest for a bit." The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth turned around and said.

His face was still hidden in the darkness, and his features couldn't be seen clearly, only the outline of his face was visible, and his expression was quite warm.

"Lord, you previously said that after the mission in the Jiuyuan Observatory is completed, you would tell me about my origins. Now that the matter of the Jiuyuan Observatory has been settled, I wonder if you can tell me, who are my parents?" Jiao San didn't retreat, instead, he hesitated for a moment before opening his mouth to ask, his eyes fixed on the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth.

The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth looked at Jiao San, remaining silent for a long time.

Jiao San was stared at by the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth, and his eyes began to waver, but he didn't retreat.

"It seems you really want to know, so I'll tell you now, your mother is..." The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth sighed and said.

Jiao San heard this and his breathing stopped.

"I brought Rusong to the Wheel of Rebirth Hall, not just for Han Li, but also for you, do you understand my meaning?" The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth looked at Jiao San, sighed, and said.

"Your meaning is, Rusong is my...?" Jiao San's face showed a shocked expression, and he involuntarily took two steps back.

"...That's right, Rusong is your mother." The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth was silent for a moment before slowly saying.

...

It's unknown how much time passed, but Jiao San had already left the great hall, and the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth continued carving.

The stone chips fell, and the carving was quickly completed, depicting a woman wearing a palace dress, but her face was flat and didn't have any carved features.

Moreover, the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth didn't seem to intend to continue.

The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth's carving skills were incredible, and the woman in the palace dress, although not fully completed, seemed to come alive, emitting a unique aura that was both gentle and overbearing.

He stretched out his hand to gently stroke the woman's smooth cheek, as if he was infatuated.

...

The Underworld.

Han Li and his group quickly flew forward, as they had already been discovered, and they no longer hid, instead, they sped up their journey.

Zi Ling and Shi Chuan Kong's strength was quite formidable, and they didn't slow down the group's progress.

The group's direction wasn't straightforward, and Han Li followed the Ghost Witch's guidance, constantly changing direction to avoid the ghost tribes' residences, in order to avoid unnecessary conflicts.

After several days, the group arrived at the edge of a black forest.

The trees in the forest were unusually tall, with some reaching hundreds or even thousands of feet, and the branches were densely packed, almost covering the sky.

Through the dense foliage, one could see that the forest was pitch black, and almost nothing could be seen, emitting a very deep and mysterious aura.

The ghostly energy in the forest was also extremely dense, and the wind blowing through made a mournful sound, like the wailing of a hundred ghosts, making one's scalp feel numb.

"Is this the Hundred Ghost Forest? One of the most treacherous places in the Underworld, do we have to cross it?" Shi Chuan Kong looked at Han Li and asked.

"Crossing the Hundred Ghost Forest, the Yellow Springs Great Marsh is not far, and the Yellow Springs Great Marsh is surrounded by the Four Great Ghost Tribes of the Yanluo Domain. The Four Great Ghost Tribes are not to be underestimated, and if we're discovered, it will be troublesome. It's better to cross the Hundred Ghost Forest." Han Li said.

He said these things, half of which he had learned from books, and the other half was told to him by the Ghost Witch.

Since meeting Shi Chuan Kong and Zi Ling, the Ghost Witch had stopped speaking, only communicating with Han Li through their spiritual connection, as if he didn't want Shi Chuan Kong and Zi Ling to know about his existence.
