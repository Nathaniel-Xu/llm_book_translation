"Get back!" Dongfang Bai shouted as he made a move.

The five old men in the Taiyi realm heard his words and immediately led the others to fly towards the inside.

Han Li didn't pay attention to the others and suddenly changed his sword technique.

More than sixty flying swords with golden lightning on their surface appeared, and a dense, cold glow filled the air, making the space around them tremble and become hazy.

This time, the sword energy was much stronger than before, and the green silk threads around the giant python couldn't even touch the flying swords. Instead, they were torn apart by the sound of ripping fabric.

The green giant pythons were also wrapped around by the sword energy and broken into several pieces.

"Boom!"

Dongfang Bai's eyes narrowed, and he shouted loudly.

The green giant pythons' bodies suddenly swelled and then exploded, turning into a green sun that filled half the sky and created a massive whirlwind that swept across the area.

The space shook, and the sword light was disrupted.

Dongfang Bai took the opportunity to turn around and wrap his body in a green cloud, flying towards the depths of the palace.

Han Li saw this and was shocked, but then his eyes narrowed, and he activated his true wheel technique.

A loud thunderclap sounded, and his figure disappeared, only to reappear in front of Dongfang Bai.

He disappeared and reappeared in an instant, leaving Dongfang Bai momentarily stunned.

Before Dongfang Bai could react, Han Li activated his true word technique, and countless golden waves spread out from his body, quickly covering Dongfang Bai.

This series of movements was like a flowing cloud, completed in an instant.

Dongfang Bai's body was frozen in mid-air, along with the green light around him, as if he was a fly trapped in amber.

Han Li's eyes flashed with a fierce killing intent, and he raised his hand to point.

A brilliant golden light shot out from his hand, "popping" through Dongfang Bai's abdomen and creating a blood-red hole.

But after the attack, Han Li's face changed, and he quickly withdrew his golden waves.

Dongfang Bai's body suddenly appeared with a layer of white light, quickly turning into a white puppet.

The puppet seemed to be made of white beast bones, with talismans attached to its body, and white patterns flashing on its surface, forming a mysterious human-shaped diagram.

"Replacement puppet?" Han Li's face turned ugly.

He had seen records of this white puppet in Crab Daoist's books, which said that it was a unique puppet created by a powerful being in the Heavenly Court. It could inject one's spiritual energy and law power into the puppet, creating a replacement that was identical to the original in appearance and aura.

Crab Daoist had wanted to obtain one of these puppets for research, but had never succeeded. He didn't expect to encounter one here.

At this moment, numerous green lights appeared, forming a green spiritual domain that enveloped Han Li.

Thick, gnarled branches suddenly appeared, wrapping around Han Li's body and devouring his spiritual energy.

At the same time, a massive golden mountain peak appeared in the sky, occupying half of the space, with giant symbols etched into its surface. It seemed to be a heavenly artifact, radiating a destructive aura, and was about to crush Han Li.

On the mountain peak, the figures of Dongfang Bai, the five old men in the Taiyi realm, and the other golden immortals were visible, all of whom were solemnly activating their techniques to control the golden mountain peak.

The mountain peak had yet to fall, but an immense, crushing force emanated from it.

A deafening "rumble" shook the air!

The golden mountain peak crashed down, causing the ground within a radius of tens of thousands of miles to tremble violently. The entire Golden Source Palace, along with the nearby mountains, sank three feet into the ground.

Dongfang Bai saw this and finally smiled.

This Mustard Gold Mountain was something he had spent countless years and resources creating, using the golden yuan stones from the Golden Source Mountains. He knew its power best.

Unfortunately, the mountain was too massive and heavy, and his own spiritual energy couldn't activate it. He had to rely on the palace's array to control it, which was why he hadn't brought it with him earlier.

The other cultivators, including the five old men in the Taiyi realm, were also secretly relieved and excited.

Being able to work together with the palace master to drive this powerful artifact and defeat the enemy was a rare opportunity for training.

But the next moment, Dongfang Bai's smile froze, and the others were also taken aback.
Everyone's gaze fell upon the towering golden peak that exceeded a thousand meters in height, with many people displaying looks of incredulity, as if they had seen a ghost in broad daylight.

But then, the originally stable golden peak began to shake and tremble, and slowly rose into the air, as if being lifted from below.

It didn't take long for them to realize what was happening.

Underneath the massive mountain peak, a three-headed, six-armed giant stood up, in the same posture as when Han Li was practicing the "Tian Xia Zhen Yu Gong".

Two massive arms held up the golden mountain, as if lifting a common stone.

"It's impossible to lift the Xumi Golden Mountain with just physical strength!" Dong Fang Bai shouted in shock, but his voice was cut off in an instant.

A golden glow surrounded Han Li's giant form, and the trees that had taken root in his body suddenly disappeared.

A small golden tree floated in front of the giant, which was the Dong Yi Divine Tree that Han Li had painstakingly refined, radiating dazzling golden light.

The green plants in the nearby spiritual realm instantly transformed into a stream of yuan qi, recognizing their ancestor and merging into the Dong Yi Divine Tree, which then transmitted the energy into Han Li's body.

The spiritual energy that Han Li had absorbed earlier was rapidly restored.

Meanwhile, the green spiritual realm rapidly dimmed and thinned, as if withering away.

"This is impossible, my Wood Spirit Realm is a self-sustaining system, it should be everlasting, how could it be devoured..." Dong Fang Bai's face turned pale with terror, and he was about to do something, but Han Li's giant form took action first.

The giant's remaining four arms shot up into the air, with silver patterns appearing on his fists, each transforming into a dozen silver talismans.

With a loud "Boom!", four massive fists exploded with brilliant golden light, and under the giant's three heads, they simultaneously roared and struck the Xumi Golden Mountain.

A deafening explosion shook the air, even louder than the sound of the Xumi Golden Mountain landing earlier.

The golden mountain peak shot forward, knocking down over a dozen mountain peaks before finally coming to a stop.

The people on top of the mountain were already shaken off by the impact, with only a few powerful individuals managing to hold on, their faces filled with terror and unable to speak.

Dong Fang Bai's face was deathly pale, with cold sweat dripping down, and he immediately dispelled his spiritual realm, transforming into a green light that rapidly fled towards the depths of the Immortal Palace.

"Don't think you can escape!" Han Li's giant form shot forward, chasing after Dong Fang Bai.

Just then, a thick, dark cloud suddenly rolled in from the side, blocking Han Li's path, and from within the cloud, the five Taichi elders appeared.

Each of the five elders held a black flag, and with a fierce wave, the dark cloud expanded, enveloping Han Li, and eight massive, ferocious black dragon claws shot out, grabbing towards Han Li.

The eight claws emitted a different aura than before, without the corrosive feeling, but instead radiating a powerful, piercing force that seemed capable of tearing through the sky.

The five elders, despite intercepting Han Li, were secretly worried.

The brief exchange earlier had given them a deep understanding of Han Li's power, and as elders of the Golden Source Immortal Palace, they had to obey the Palace Master's orders, or risk being guilty of disobedience.

For now, they could only hope to use the Five Dragon Heavenly Flag to temporarily hold off Han Li, and then plan their next move.

"You're looking for death!" Han Li coldly snorted, and with a flick of his sleeve...

Seventy-two green bamboo swords shot out from his sleeve, transforming into seventy-two electric arcs of sword light, emitting a powerful thunderous law, and slashing towards the black dragon claws.

With a loud "Sizzle", the black dragon claws, which seemed invincible, were easily shattered by the electric sword light.

In the dark cloud, the five elders' black flags cracked, and the light on them dimmed. The five elders were shocked and quickly retreated.

But the seventy-two electric arcs of sword light were too fast, and with a few flashes, they caught up to the dark cloud, and mercilessly hacked down.

The five Taichi elders roared in anger, and the dark cloud violently churned, meeting the electric sword light head-on. The five elders' bodies glowed with treasure light as they summoned their protective treasures.

However, upon contact, the dark cloud seemed to evaporate like ice and snow in the face of the electric sword light, and the five elders' protective treasures were easily destroyed, shattering into pieces.

The five Taichi elders were terrified, finally realizing the vast difference in power between Han Li and themselves, and they were about to use their shrinking secret technique to escape.

But a flash of golden light appeared, and the five elders' necks were suddenly bound by an electric arc of golden light, with a fierce sword intent descending upon them. The five elders' hearts turned cold, and their spiritual energy slowed, making them dare not move.

The surrounding Golden Immortal cultivators saw Dong Fang Bai escape, and many of them had already lost their will to fight, fleeing in all directions. Only the five Taichi elders' direct disciples remained, who had been about to continue attacking Han Li.

Seeing the scene, they were filled with terror, and someone shouted, causing the scene to erupt into chaos. The remaining cultivators turned from their encirclement to a chaotic retreat, with a scene of trees falling and monkeys scattering.

The five Taichi elders, still bound by the electric arc of golden light, were unable to move, and their faces turned pale with fear.

Han Li's giant form stood tall, his three heads gazing at the fleeing cultivators, his eyes cold and unyielding.

With a wave of his hand, the electric arc of golden light dissipated, and the five Taichi elders collapsed to the ground, their bodies trembling with fear.

Han Li's giant form slowly began to shrink, returning to his normal size, and with a cold smile, he said, "You should have stayed out of this."
