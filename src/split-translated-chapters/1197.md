The years passed by like flowing water, and another 90,000 years went by in an instant.

The scenery within the Flower Petal Space was as if it had been frozen in time, with no changes whatsoever.

Han Li was still sitting cross-legged in his Spiritual Realm, his face covered in a thick black beard, his eyes calm and serene, exuding an aura of age and wisdom.

The restrictions of the Spiritual Realm were far more severe than he had imagined, and it had been 20,000 years since his five Time Law Incarnations had been completed, and his Spiritual Realm had entered the Realm of Creation.

Among them, the True Word Treasure Wheel and the Eastern Yi Divine Tree had directly materialized, reaching the Heavenly Human Realm.

However, this unbalanced state had been difficult to break, and his Spiritual Realm's abnormal state had made it impossible to lift the restrictions.

"Success or failure lies in this one move, let's see what you're capable of," Han Li said, his eyes narrowing slightly as he raised his head.

As soon as his words fell, he raised his hand, and a golden light burst forth, and the Lotus Flower Treasure Lamp flew out, passing over the True Word Treasure Wheel and reaching the highest point of the Spiritual Realm.

This lamp was not an ordinary object, but the Sages' Lamp that Han Li had obtained after much hardship from the Years' Tower.

On it, countless star-like Disrupted Time Flames scattered, flashing with a faint light.

As the Sages' Lamp hung in the air, the countless star flames seemed to be ignited in an instant, and the starlight began to rapidly condense, finally gathering into a single point, transforming into a golden flame that flew down and landed in the lamp's chamber.

A soft "whoosh" sound echoed.

The Sages' Lamp's surface suddenly burst forth with dazzling golden light, and the countless symbols on its surface flashed and flew out, disappearing into the Spiritual Realm's light screen.

Immediately after, the entire lamp began to fade away, its body suddenly flashing with light, transforming into countless fireflies that flew towards the sky, following the symbols and disappearing into the light screen.

Han Li looked up, and saw a round moon hanging in the sky, surrounded by countless stars, its beauty leaving him breathless.

His heart stirred, and his body's Five Elements Fantastical World Incantation began to operate at full force, his mind communicating with his Spiritual Realm, sensing every change within it.

The mountain peaks formed by the yellow sand were still and unchanged, but under the cover of the Eastern Yi Divine Tree's forest, a layer of green had appeared, giving off a vibrant and lively atmosphere.

The River of Time still only had a faint, illusory glow, but it seemed to be flowing smoothly, giving off a sense of being in harmony with the mountains.

Han Li knew that once he found the Water Attribute Time Law Incarnation and the Earth Attribute Time Law Incarnation, and merged them into his Spiritual Realm, he would be able to make the entire Spiritual Realm's Five Elements communicate, reaching the Realm of Mutual Generation and Harmony.

At that time, his Spiritual Realm would truly be in the Heavenly Human Realm.

"Come, let's see how stubborn you are," Han Li said, his heart filled with anger, as he swung his hands.

The round moon above him suddenly burst forth with golden light, casting down countless rays of light, and the ground beneath him began to shake violently, the Eastern Yi Divine Tree's branches and vines growing wildly, extending towards the ground.

However, the range of the golden light was limited to the Spiritual Realm, and once it reached the outside, it would automatically dissipate into thin, golden threads.

The Two-Life Tree's roots could only reach the edge of the Spiritual Realm, and once they extended into the real world, they would wither and shrink.

Han Li had already grown accustomed to this phenomenon, having tried many times before.

He had thought that if he could break through the Spiritual Realm and destroy the Light of Time Heavenly Array that was causing the distortion, he might be able to break the current stalemate.

However, unless it was an attack containing powerful Time Law energy, it would be impossible to penetrate the Spiritual Realm's seal, and Han Li's five Time Law Incarnations had already merged with the Spiritual Realm, so he could only rely on the Spiritual Realm's power.

The True Word Treasure Wheel and the Eastern Yi Divine Tree were not suited for attacking, so Han Li had spent a lot of time creating the Disrupted Time Fire, and then merged the powerful Sages' Lamp into it.

"Fall..." Han Li's voice exploded.

The sky was filled with flames, and countless star flames broke free from the light screen, falling towards the ground.

In the midst of the roaring flames, the Disrupted Time Flames transformed into enormous fireballs, like a rain of fire and stars, falling from the sky.

A loud, thunderous sound echoed.

Han Li's Spiritual Realm was thrown into chaos, the mountain peaks formed by the yellow sand crumbling and breaking apart, turning into a sea of golden dust.

The Spiritual Realm's light screen was broken through in an instant, and the ground beneath was struck by the powerful force, causing the earth to rise up and surge towards the bamboo building.

The array core that had been set up there was destroyed, and the Light of Time Heavenly Array's glow flashed once before stopping.

Immediately after, Han Li saw the round moon-like True Word Treasure Wheel above him, a symbol belonging to the Heavenly Day Clock flashing once before extinguishing, and the Time Law energy it released rapidly decreasing.

The Spiritual Realm's light screen flashed once, and its range expanded, re-encompassing the entire Flower Petal Space.

Han Li felt a sense of relief, as the strange, restrictive energy that had been surrounding him finally disappeared.

He felt a mix of emotions, a sense of joy and regret.
If it weren't for his previous greed during his closed cultivation, which accelerated the creation process of the spiritual domain, he wouldn't have been trapped in the spiritual domain and missed the opportunity to rescue Jintong.

"I'm afraid Xiao Bai has already been summoned back by Bai Ze," Han Li sighed and said.

After speaking, he waved his hand to collect the spiritual domain and walked towards the bamboo pavilion, starting to gather the materials for the Guangyin Tianxuan Great Array.

As he arrived at the bamboo forest, his eyes suddenly flashed, and he bent down to pick up a Xianyuan stone that was placed at the center of the array.

"How is this possible?" Han Li wondered, examining the stone.

The Xianyuan stone's spiritual light was dim, but it hadn't turned gray and white, indicating that it still had some remaining spiritual energy.

Just as Han Li was puzzled, the bamboo pavilion's door suddenly opened, and Xiao Bai rushed out.

"Master, what's going on? You stayed in the Flower Branch Space and didn't come out, and even closed the door, I couldn't get in!" Xiao Bai complained as soon as he saw Han Li.

However, when he saw Han Li's worn-out face and beard, his brow furrowed in concern.

"You... you haven't returned to the Barbarian Realm?" Han Li asked in surprise.

"It's only been a few years, why would I return to the Barbarian Realm? Master, are you okay... what happened, why did you lock the door to the Flower Branch Space?" Xiao Bai asked, noticing something was off.

Han Li explained the situation to Xiao Bai, who listened intently.

"Two thousand years, plus another two thousand years, and then nine thousand more years, that's almost ten thousand years... according to the time difference of the Guangyin Tianxuan Great Array, it doesn't add up..." Xiao Bai counted on his fingers.

"How many years have passed outside?" Han Li asked, his brow furrowed.

"Less than fifty years," Xiao Bai replied, holding up his hand.

"Fifty years..." Han Li's eyes widened in shock, and he stood there for a long time, unable to believe it.

Xiao Bai thought Han Li had gone mad, but then he noticed the change in Han Li's aura and his eyes lit up with excitement.

"Master, you've reached the Daluo realm!"

Han Li nodded, still in shock, and said, "No wonder the Xianyuan stone still has spiritual energy... it makes sense now."

Xiao Bai was confused, "What are you talking about? You're making me even more confused."

Han Li explained, "The time difference conversion of the Guangyin Tianxuan Great Array is only a hundred times, so in the four thousand years before the anomaly, only forty years passed outside. But after the anomaly, the array's time difference conversion efficiency increased greatly, becoming a thousand times. So, in the last ten years, I spent almost ten thousand years in the array."

Xiao Bai was stunned by the numbers, but he understood that Han Li had spent ten thousand years cultivating in the past decade, and his heart was filled with shock and awe.

"This Guangyin Tianxuan Great Array is so powerful?" Xiao Bai exclaimed.

Han Li smiled, "It was a coincidence, and I was trapped in it, almost unable to come out."

Xiao Bai laughed, "Good fortune and bad fortune are intertwined, as long as the outcome is good, it's fine."

Han Li nodded, but his mind was already thinking about how to replicate this coincidence in the future, which would be a huge advantage for his cultivation.

"Where's Jintong?" Han Li asked.

"He's still outside, keeping watch. I saw that the Flower Branch Space's restrictions were lifted, so I came in to take a look," Xiao Bai replied.

"I'm sorry to have worried you," Han Li said with a smile.

"Hehe, how does it feel to have reached the Daluo realm?" Xiao Bai asked.

"My previous cultivation had some issues, and my spiritual domain is still unstable. Since there's still time, you can help me guard it for a while longer, and I'll stabilize my cultivation," Han Li said.

"No problem! I'll go tell Jintong, he's been worried about you too," Xiao Bai said.

Han Li nodded, and Xiao Bai left.

After Xiao Bai left, Han Li's thoughts stirred, and a layer of golden light expanded, enveloping the entire Flower Branch Space.

As he twisted his wrist and snapped his fingers, the spiritual domain inside changed, with mountains and rivers shifting, trees swaying, and the time law aura becoming extremely dense.

Han Li walked through the domain, almost without needing time, and with just a thought, he could change the scenery and move instantly.

He made a few more attempts, becoming more familiar with his spiritual domain, and his heart felt more confident about his upcoming journey to the Jiuyuan.
