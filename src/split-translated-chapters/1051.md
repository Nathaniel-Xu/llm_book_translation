Han Li saw the situation and a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes.

It turned out that Lan Yuanzi was using some secret technique to burn the power of the laws within his body, no wonder he could suddenly burst out with such powerful strength.

He thought to himself, his hands didn't hesitate for a moment, and he immediately made a hand seal and swung his arm.

In the flash of golden light, the True Speech Treasure Wheel appeared behind him, spinning rapidly.

Countless golden ripples burst forth from the True Speech Treasure Wheel, instantly enveloping a range of thousands of feet.

The blue light balls around him immediately stopped, and Lan Yuanzi was about to break free from the divine sense chain and escape, but the golden ripples were too fast, and he was trapped before he could escape.

The blue light that had surged out of the void nearby suddenly stopped, and everything around him quickly returned to calm.

Han Li, on the other hand, moved his body and easily flew out of the blue light ball, and with a flicker, he appeared in front of Lan Yuanzi, his five fingers pressed against Lan Yuanzi's forehead, ready to crush him.

However, he stopped and looked in the direction Lan Cai had escaped, then looked at Lan Yuanzi in his hand, and a figure appeared in his mind - his little sister. He sighed softly and raised his hand to slap Lan Yuanzi's lower abdomen.

Instantly, five streams of time law power burst forth from his palm, spinning rapidly and condensing into a five-element seal, which sank into Lan Yuanzi's body.

The sealing technique of the "Great Five Elements Illusory World" could also seal others.

Han Li then took Lan Yuanzi's storage ring and checked his body with his divine sense, finding nothing hidden, before putting away the True Speech Treasure Wheel and the golden ripples around him.

The blue light and law power on Lan Yuanzi's body dissipated rapidly, like ice and snow in the scorching sun, and he fell to the ground, devoid of any spiritual energy.

Han Li reached out and caught Lan Yuanzi, and they landed on the ground.

At this moment, Lan Cai had already escaped from Han Li's divine sense range, and although there were still some residual auras, the hope of catching up was slim.

Moreover, this place seemed to be safe, but Han Li's heart was still filled with a sense of unease, and he didn't dare to continue chasing after Lan Cai.

"Such a powerful sealing technique, no wonder you were able to escape the Golden Source Heavenly Palace's pursuit three times. I, Lan Yuanzi, admit defeat," Lan Yuanzi said with a smile.

"You're quite bold, still able to laugh in this situation," Han Li said, looking at Lan Yuanzi.

"My life is now in your hands, friend. Whether I laugh or cry, I believe it won't affect your judgment. So, I'd rather make the most of it," Lan Yuanzi said nonchalantly.

"Since you have self-awareness, I have a few questions to ask you. If you don't want me to search your soul, just answer honestly," Han Li said, his expression cold and detached.

"Please ask, friend Han," Lan Yuanzi replied immediately.

"You and your sister came to the Golden Source Heavenly Domain to capture me, right?" Han Li asked, his face revealing a hint of coldness.

"We were ordered by the Miao Fa Heavenly Lord to capture you, friend Han, and to take a treasure from you that originally belonged to the Jiuyuan Observatory - a time treasure shaped like a small, dark green bottle," Lan Yuanzi replied without hesitation.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat when he heard this.

The Pantian Bottle had always been his deepest secret, unknown to outsiders except for a few close friends. Now, it seemed that this secret could no longer be hidden.

"How did the Jiuyuan Observatory know that the treasure was with me?" Han Li asked, his voice calm.

"I'm not entirely sure, but I heard it was inferred from a Causal Crystal, which was obtained from you, friend Han," Lan Yuanzi replied.

"Causal Crystal!" Han Li's eyes flashed, and he thought of the time crystal.

"Did the Golden Source Heavenly Palace send anyone else besides you two to capture me?" he asked.

"No, the Miao Fa Heavenly Lord only sent us two. We thought that our combined strength would be enough to defeat you, but it seems that your strength is far greater than we anticipated," Lan Yuanzi said with a bitter smile.

Han Li's heart relaxed slightly when he heard this, and he asked Lan Yuanzi a few more questions, which Lan Yuanzi answered honestly without hesitation.

After finishing his questions, Han Li stood silently, his eyes gazing into the distance, contemplating something.

Lan Yuanzi stood quietly beside him, not interrupting.

Han Li gazed into the distance for a moment, then suddenly raised his hand and pointed at Lan Yuanzi's forehead.

Lan Yuanzi's eyes widened in shock, but he was unable to react, and his eyes rolled back as he fell into a coma.

Han Li made a hand seal and pointed at Lan Yuanzi's brain, casting a sealing technique to restrict his divine sense.

"Qi Hun, was what this person just said true?" he asked, his eyes flashing with cold light.
There was no deceit or concealment in his words, they were all true," said Ti Huang's voice in the void.

Han Li heard this and nodded slowly.

Although he had some appreciation for this Lan Yuanzi, if he had uttered even half a sentence of falsehood, he would have killed him without hesitation and searched his soul.

"Why bother asking him questions? It would be more convenient to just kill him and search his soul directly," Han Li said, his voice low.

Behind him, the void rippled, and a silver light gate appeared, with Ti Huang's figure emerging from it.

"That Lan Cai escaped, but it seems they have a deep relationship. Lan Cai might still come looking for him, and this Lan Yuanzi might still be useful," Han Li said, waving his hand to throw the unconscious Lan Yuanzi into the Flower Branch Space.

"That Lan Cai? They're not even a match for you, Master. Now that Lan Cai is alone, what's there to worry about? If she dares to come, it's even better, we can catch her in one net," Ti Huang said, waving his small fist nonchalantly.

"Don't be careless, I'm not worried about Lan Cai alone, but Qi Mozi is also in this immortal mansion, and they're both from the Heavenly Court. If they join forces, it'll be troublesome. Let's be cautious," Han Li said, shaking his head.

Ti Huang hesitated for a moment before nodding.

Han Li didn't continue to focus on the Lan siblings, instead looking around.

As he chased after Lan Yuanzi, he had arrived at the depths of the Red Sand Desert.

At this moment, the sand sea had changed, with towering sand dunes rising up like small mountains. The sand dunes were no longer barren, with red thorny vines growing on them.

In the depths of the sand dunes, there were also some sand lizards, sand scorpions, and other small creatures, but they were all ordinary living beings, not demonic beasts.

Ti Huang also looked around, his eyes suddenly widening as he let out a soft exclamation.

"What did you notice?" Han Li asked, his eyes lighting up.

Ti Huang's body was special, and his perspective on things was different from Han Li's. He often had unique discoveries.

"This place has a strong death aura, and the resentment is heavy. It seems this isn't a good place. Master, you need to be careful," Ti Huang said, his expression serious.

"I also sense that this place is dangerous. That stone stele at the entrance had a 'two' character written on it. Could this be the second layer of the Years Tower?" Han Li asked, his expression also serious.

"It's very likely. Although the Years Tower appears to be a single, rounded structure, it's actually divided into layers. I've observed that it has seven layers, and this seems to be the second layer. I wonder what that Taishang Xianzun built this tower for," Ti Huang said.

"Whatever the reason, let's investigate first," Han Li said, shaking his head. He waved his hand, and a blue light emerged, smoothing out the battle scars around them. Then, he chose a direction and flew off.

As for Ti Huang, he didn't let him return to the Flower Branch Space, instead bringing him along.

In the blink of an eye, half a day had passed.

The surroundings were still the same, with the endless red sand sea stretching out. This sand sea was enormous, and there was no sign of anything unusual.

Just as Han Li was starting to get confused, Ti Huang suddenly let out a soft exclamation and flew downwards.

Han Li's eyebrows twitched, and he followed after him. The two of them quickly landed in front of a sand dune.

Ti Huang waved his hand, and a black light emerged, splitting the sand dune in two.

A massive, gray-white skeleton was revealed, resembling a giant lizard's skeleton. It was covered in wind-eroded cracks, and it seemed like it could shatter at any moment.

"What's special about this skeleton?" Han Li asked, his divine sense having already detected the skeleton, but he hadn't noticed anything unusual.

"Master, how many years do you think this skeleton has been here?" Ti Huang asked, his pale fingers lightly touching the wind-eroded skeleton.

"This sand lizard is quite sturdy, and its skeleton is even more so. For it to erode to this state, it must have been here for at least a few hundred years. Why are you asking this?" Han Li replied, curious.

"This sand lizard died less than ten years ago," Ti Huang said, shaking his head.

"What? How do you know?" Han Li asked, his entire body trembling with surprise.

"Any living being has a soul, and when they die, their soul disperses, leaving behind some residual soul energy fragments on the corpse. These fragments take years to dissipate completely, allowing us to determine the time of death. This skeleton still has very dense residual soul energy fragments, indicating that it died less than ten years ago," Ti Huang explained.

"Amazing, I didn't know there was a way to determine the time of death like that," Han Li said, impressed.

Only someone with extremely strong divine sense could detect the residual soul energy fragments on a corpse, and even Han Li's powerful divine sense couldn't do it. It seemed that Ti Huang's divine sense was getting stronger and stronger.

"But if this sand lizard died less than ten years ago, why has its skeleton eroded to this state?" Han Li asked, his brow furrowed in concern.
