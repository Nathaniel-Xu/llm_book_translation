Han Li gazed at the five ghostly creatures before him, his face expressionless. His body crackled with lightning as he shot out five bamboo swords, which transformed into five beams of golden light in mid-air, slicing towards the ghostly creatures.

However, the ghostly creatures' bodies suddenly turned into illusions, and the golden light pierced through them without causing any harm.

The ghostly creatures moved with incredible speed, arriving before Han Li in an instant. They grasped his body and bit down, causing blood to splatter everywhere.

Han Li's body glowed with golden light as he prepared to unleash his spiritual domain, but his face suddenly changed, and a faint smile appeared. The golden light extinguished, and he stood still, his eyes closed.

The ghostly creatures bit down on his body, causing intense pain to penetrate his soul. Yet, he remained still, his face expressionless, as if he felt no pain.

The ghostly creatures tore at his body, ripping off chunks of flesh and devouring them with excitement. In an instant, Han Li's body was reduced to a skeleton, but his eyes still shone with vitality.

The ghostly creatures grasped his skeletal body, ready to rip it apart.

"Fierce ghosts are but illusions, I am not myself, what fear, what worry?" Han Li opened his eyes, gazing forward calmly, as a faint, shimmering light emanated from his body.

The light enveloped the ghostly creatures, causing them to disintegrate into ashes. The blood pool beneath them vanished, and Han Li returned to the black space.

His body had returned to normal, and the previous events seemed like a dream. But before he could catch his breath, the surroundings changed again.

He appeared in a world filled with pink hues, surrounded by numerous beautiful women, including young girls and mature women. They danced and sang around him, their movements seductive and alluring.

But Han Li remained expressionless, ignoring the women.

Suddenly, a gentle breeze blew, and a girl appeared behind him, embracing him. It was Bai Su Xian.

"Senior Han, I've long admired you, but you've never made a move, fearing it would be unbecoming of your seniority," Bai Su Xian said, her voice melodious and charming.

Another girl, Yu Meng Han, approached, her eyes shining with flirtation.

"Senior Han, I've worked tirelessly to cultivate, and my goal is to find you..."

The breeze carried the scent of perfume, and two more girls appeared, Yuan Yao and Yan Li.

"Senior Han, Yan Li has long harbored feelings for you, you can't disappoint her," Yuan Yao said, her body pressed against Han Li's arm.

Yan Li's face turned red, but she also wrapped her arms around Han Li.

The women's faces changed, transforming into those of the female cultivators Han Li had met before. They surrounded him, their movements seductive and alluring.

"Beautiful women are but fleeting clouds, I am not myself, what attachment, what entanglement?" Han Li's expression remained unchanged, his eyes flashing with a piercing light.

The women transformed into skeletons, which shattered into pieces, and the pink world disappeared, returning to the black space.

But the surroundings changed again, and Han Li appeared in a grand hall, seated on a throne, surrounded by figures from the Wheel of Reincarnation, including Li Yuan Ji, Yue Mian, and others.

They kneeled before him, their faces filled with reverence.

"We pay our respects to the Supreme One, congratulations on achieving the Great Dao, and ascending to the throne. From now on, the heavens and the world will bow to your authority," they said in unison.

Han Li's expression remained indifferent.

"Bring them in!" a burly guard shouted.

A group of people, including Qi Mo Zi, Shi Po Kong, and Yin Cheng, were led in, their bodies bound by golden chains and locks. They were followed by Guo Huo Jin, who looked disheveled and weak.

These people had lost their former glory, and the golden chains seemed to suppress their powers, rendering them ordinary humans.

A giant of a man, wielding a shining guillotine, appeared behind them.

"Behead them!"

The guillotine flashed, and the prisoners were beheaded, their severed heads rolling on the ground.

Han Li remained unmoved.

"Supreme One, why do you still not smile? Is there still someone you wish to kill? Please, tell us, and we will capture them for you," the burly guard asked, half-kneeling before Han Li.

"Power and authority are but illusions, I am not myself, what attachment, what confusion?" Han Li replied calmly.

The surroundings shattered, and everything disappeared, returning to the black space.
Han Li's face remained unchanged, but his mental state had shifted imperceptibly. 

Although he had just passed through three layers of the Illusory Realm, cutting off three types of delusions, his mind and spirit felt somewhat exhausted, but it also gave him a sense of unprecedented ease.

Just then, the surrounding scenery changed again, and he found himself in a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood, with countless bodies piled up on the ground.

The people who had died were all wearing the attire of the Wheel of Rebirth Hall and the Barbarian Domain, and many of them he had seen before, all lying dead here.

The master of the Wheel of Rebirth Hall, Gan Jiuzhen, and the leaders of the Barbarian Domain, Yue Mian, Bai Ze, and others, were all here, lying silently with looks of terror and unwillingness on their faces.

The air was filled with a nauseating stench of blood and rot, making it impossible to distinguish reality from illusion.

"Han Li!" a cold voice shouted from the front, and a figure appeared before him, it was Guo Huai.

"Look, this is the outcome of opposing me!" Guo Huai sneered.

He raised his hand, and several figures appeared in front of him, all bound and tied up. They were Nan Gong Wan, Zi Ling, Jin Tong, Ti Hun, Liu Le'er, Shi Chuan Kong, and finally, two more people, who were his parents from the mortal world.

Han Li looked at this scene, his face twitching slightly, before quickly regaining his composure.

"I have investigated clearly, these are all people who are important to you, so immediately submit to me, swear to acknowledge me as your superior, or else they will die one by one in front of you!" Guo Huai sneered.

Han Li remained unmoved, standing silently.

"Good, you're not disappointing, since you're the only one besides me who has mastered the Time Law to the peak. Then, you'll watch as I... " Guo Huai sneered, pointing his finger.

A golden light shot out, transforming into a golden blade that pierced through Shi Chuan Kong's chest, cutting him in two.

Han Li's expression wavered for a moment, before disappearing.

"Ha ha, good!" Guo Huai laughed, pointing his finger again.

Two golden lights shot out, piercing through Jin Tong and Ti Hun's bodies, and they also fell to the ground.

Han Li's face flushed with a layer of blood, but it quickly receded.

"Unexpectedly, friends are not worth mentioning in your eyes, what about familial love? This little girl Liu Le'er, it's said you treated her like your own sister, will you watch her die here?" Guo Huai sneered, pointing his finger.

A golden light shot out, piercing through Liu Le'er's body.

Han Li let out a "wa" sound, spitting out a small mouthful of blood, his body swaying before stabilizing.

"Next are your two dao companions, and your parents, who should I kill first? Why not let you choose? This time, I'll give you the choice, you say who to kill first, and I'll kill them first, leaving the one you cherish the most to the end. How's that?" Guo Huai laughed.

Han Li stood there, his face blood-red, his breathing heavy, no longer calm, but still gritting his teeth, not speaking.

"Truly disappointing, since you won't choose, I'll choose for you. Killing one by one is too troublesome, it's better to just kill them all at once." Guo Huai looked at the four people, his hand glowing with golden light, about to shoot out.

"Stop!" Han Li suddenly shouted.

Guo Huai stopped, a radiant smile on his face.

"Finally understood? Good, quickly kneel down and acknowledge me as your superior, I can spare their lives." Guo Huai looked at Han Li, laughing loudly.

Han Li slowly stepped forward, his face blood-red, seemingly on fire, his forehead sweating, finally stopping in front of Guo Huai.

"Kneel down!" Guo Huai shouted.

Han Li slowly knelt down.

"Ha ha... " Guo Huai laughed, extremely pleased, his hand grasping, as five black lights appeared above Han Li's head, piercing towards his body.

"Clang" - the black lights collided with Han Li's body, unable to penetrate at all.

Han Li looked up, his face pale as jade, his eyes shining like bright moonlight.

"You... " Guo Huai's face changed, before he could react, a crystalline light appeared before him, striking down.

"Rip" - Guo Huai's body was torn apart, dissipating into nothingness.

"Father, mother, Wan'er, Zi Ling, I'm sorry to let you be used by this villain." Han Li stood up, looking at his parents, Nan Gong Wan, and Zi Ling, speaking before waving his sleeve.

The entire blood-colored space shattered, and the four people's silhouettes disappeared.

Han Li returned to the black space, his body swaying, his face revealing fatigue.

After half a lifetime of cultivation, he was cold and detached from the world, but in reality, he valued emotions and relationships heavily. Some people were even his bottom line, and cutting them off was much more difficult than other delusions.

"Emotions and relationships, gathering and dispersing, I am not I, you are not you, he is not he, emotions are natural, without regret, without resentment."

He thought this in his heart, as the surroundings changed again, and he found himself in a foul-smelling swamp.

His body had transformed into a rotting corpse, covered in maggots and flies, his white bones exposed, emitting a pungent stench.
