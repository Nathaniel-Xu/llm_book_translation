The middle-aged man gazed at the black-clad youth, his voice cold and inquiring. "Tian Huo Hua Xue Dao! How did this sword end up in your hands? Who are you?"

The black-clad youth smiled upon hearing this, and began to mutter to himself. A crimson aura emerged from his face, flowing downwards.

His body and appearance changed, transforming into a slender youth with silver hair flowing in the wind.

Han Li's face faltered, for this person was none other than Fox Three, whom he had parted ways with in the Gray Realm.

Han Li didn't know if the other party had discovered anything from his current appearance, which was different from his original form.

"I am the ninth generation descendant of the Tian Huo tribe, Liu San Sheng, paying my respects to Senior!" Fox Three bowed respectfully to the blue-robed middle-aged man.

The blue-robed middle-aged man's expression softened slightly as he gazed at Fox Three's true appearance, but his tone remained cold. "A descendant of the Tian Huo tribe... I didn't expect to meet a fellow clansman here. So, this Tian Huo Hua Xue Dao was given to you by him?"

Fox Three replied respectfully, "Yes, and no."

The blue-robed middle-aged man snorted, "I have no interest in exchanging clever words with you here. You've chosen to follow him, and now you're here... Do you think that just because of your clan ties, I won't kill you? Or do you think that with the Tian Huo Hua Xue Dao in hand, you can resist me?"

A cold glint flashed in the blue-robed middle-aged man's eyes as he spoke, his voice laced with killing intent.

Fox Three didn't show any fear, his tone sincere. "I wouldn't dare, Senior. Your Illusory Law has reached a state of near perfection, and my power is no match for yours, even with multiple Tian Huo Hua Xue Dao. I came here today because the outside world has undergone a sudden change, and my clan has been drawn into it. I've come to ask you to lend your assistance, to help my clan through this great calamity."

The blue-robed middle-aged man's expression remained cold. "I said it back then, and I'll say it again: I will no longer concern myself with the affairs of the Tian Huo tribe. Since your cultivation isn't weak, and you're considered a talent, I won't make things difficult for you. Leave here immediately."

As he spoke, he raised his hand and snapped his fingers.

The distant Lichi Ma, which had been fighting the black-clad woman, immediately stopped its attack, and the several wind dragons swirling around it vanished into thin air.

"The Wheel of Reincarnation is indeed extraordinary, but unfortunately, the timing isn't right today. We'll have to wait for another day to have a great battle!" Lichi Ma gazed at the black-clad woman, its eyes burning with intensity, before letting out a long whistle.

Then, it vanished in a flash of white light, reappearing beside the blue-robed middle-aged man in an instant.

Han Li's expression remained unchanged, but his heart stirred once more.

The black-clad woman, seeing Lichi Ma stop its attack, didn't pursue it. Instead, she calmly made a hand seal, and the dark red circular wheel behind her spun wildly before exploding and disappearing, transforming into over a hundred dark red law crystals that merged into her body.

The woman's figure flickered, and she vanished, reappearing beside Fox Three.

The blue-robed middle-aged man glanced at the black-clad woman, but didn't say anything. He floated down beside Lichi Ma, preparing to leave.

"Senior, won't you even lend a hand to our clan in its time of need?" Fox Three asked, his face urgent, as he chased after the blue-robed middle-aged man.

The blue-robed middle-aged man's body stiffened, and he fell silent for a moment before speaking in a cold tone. "I've already said it: the Tian Huo tribe and I have no further connection. You must handle your own affairs."

Fox Three's heart was filled with anxiety, but he had already said all he could. He had no strategy to persuade the blue-robed middle-aged man.

"Wait!" Just then, the Tian Huo Hua Xue Dao in Fox Three's hand flashed with a bloody light, and a figure emerged from it â€“ the sword spirit, Shi Qing Hou.

"Ah, it's you! I didn't expect you to still be alive. No wonder the Tian Huo Hua Xue Dao's power hasn't diminished. You must have followed him as well!" The blue-robed middle-aged man's expression turned even colder, and he revealed a hint of disgust, but he didn't stop moving.

"Master is still alive, perhaps," Shi Qing Hou said, gazing at the blue-robed middle-aged man's back.

The blue-robed middle-aged man's body suddenly stopped, and he turned around, his eyes fixed intently on Shi Qing Hou. "Master is still alive? You're telling the truth? No, this is impossible. I saw Master's downfall with my own eyes back then!"

"Master's abilities are extraordinary, and he wouldn't die so easily. What happened back then, I'm afraid we didn't see the truth. I've only recently discovered some clues, and I've been investigating, which is why I submitted to him." Shi Qing Hou spoke proudly.

"Ah, I see. So you came to find me this time...?" The blue-robed middle-aged man nodded slowly, his eyes thoughtful.

However, he glanced at Han Li and the black-clad woman, and his words trailed off.

"Indeed, this matter is related to Master's possible resurrection. That's why we've come to ask for your assistance." Shi Qing Hou said.

The blue-robed middle-aged man's gaze lingered on Han Li and the black-clad woman, and his expression turned cold once more.
Since it concerns the master, I naturally won't decline, but I'm currently being held captive here, and my life-bound jade slip is still in the seventh layer. Even if I wanted to leave with you, I couldn't," said the middle-aged man in the green robe, his attitude changing greatly.

"Don't worry, we've already made thorough preparations for our arrival. I'll help you retrieve your life-bound jade slip," said Shi Qinghou, his face lighting up with joy.

"Then I'll have to trouble you. The spatial gate leading to the sixth layer is just ahead. As for the prisoners being held in the sixth layer, I'm not sure. However, the higher you go, the more formidable the prisoners become. You'll need to be careful," said the middle-aged man in the green robe, nodding and warning them.

"I have Huo San and Shao Zhangshi with me, and with the addition of Han brother, no one will be able to stop us. Han brother, isn't that right?" Shi Qinghou suddenly turned to Han Li, smiling.

Han Li's eyebrows twitched at the mention of his name.

"What? You're Han brother?" Huo San stared at Han Li in shock, his voice trembling.

The black-robed woman, however, remained calm, as if she had already known Han Li's identity.

"Ah, so this person is also one of your group? It seems the Tian Huo tribe has made some progress over the years, forming alliances with many talented individuals," said the middle-aged man in the green robe, glancing at Han Li and the black-robed woman.

"These people are all friends of Huo San, and have nothing to do with the Tian Huo tribe's old stubbornness," said Shi Qinghou.

The middle-aged man's expression changed, and he looked at Huo San with a mixture of surprise and curiosity.

"Shi senior, Huo San, and Jiao San, it's been a long time," said Han Li, flying forward, his gaze sweeping over Shi Qinghou and Huo San before landing on the black-robed woman.

"Ah, I knew you wouldn't be able to hide from Brother Han's eyes," said the black-robed woman, her hands weaving a seal, her body glowing with a faint red light as she revealed her true appearance, which was indeed Jiao San.

"Are you really Han brother?" Huo San asked, his eyes still filled with doubt.

This was understandable, as when they had parted ways in the Gray Realm, Han Li had only been a Golden Immortal at the peak of his realm. Now, over a thousand years had passed, and he had transformed into a Taiyi Realm cultivator at the peak of his realm, which was truly astonishing.

"Since you've all already discovered my true name, I'll explain. Back then, I was pursued by the Heavenly Court, and to avoid trouble, I changed my name to Li. Please don't mind," said Han Li, smiling apologetically, his hands weaving a seal, his body glowing with a faint red light as he revealed his true appearance.

"Indeed, it's really Han brother! I never thought your cultivation would progress so quickly, it's truly astonishing! Back then, during the Gray Realm's upheaval, you and Shi Chongkong were captured and taken away, and I worried about you for a long time. Seeing that you're safe and sound, I'm relieved. By the way, how is Shi brother doing?" Huo San asked, his face filled with joy.

"Back then, it was a powerful expert from the Demon Realm who intervened, using their powers to summon us back to the Demon Realm. Shi brother is doing well, and you can rest assured," said Han Li, smiling.

"That's good," said Huo San, sighing in relief.

"If we want to reminisce, we can do so after we leave the Years Tower. The matter at hand is more pressing," said Shi Qinghou, taking a step forward.

"Shi senior is right," said Huo San, showing great respect towards Shi Qinghou.

"Han brother, since we've met again in this place, it's fate. Shall we work together from now on?" Shi Qinghou asked, turning to Han Li.

"I'm ashamed to say that I entered this immortal estate by mistake, and I know nothing about it. However, from what I've heard from you, it seems you're familiar with the Years Tower. Please enlighten me," said Han Li, his expression calm, as he asked Shi Qinghou instead of responding to his question.

"Of course, this Years Tower is a leftover from a powerful Da Luo existence named Tai Sui Xian Zun. He cultivated the same time laws as you, and was once the master of the Heavenly Court's prison. However, he suddenly betrayed the Heavenly Court and escaped, taking many prisoners and treasures with him. The most famous of these treasures is the Years God Lamp, which is said to be a treasure of the time laws. It's likely that the lamp is in the seventh layer. The Heavenly Court has been chasing him for years, but no one expected him to hide in the Jin Yuan Immortal Realm, which is close to the Central Plains Immortal Realm, and secretly build this immortal estate," said Shi Qinghou, knowing that Han Li wanted to understand the situation before making a decision.

"Years God Lamp!" Han Li's heart stirred.

Ever since he entered the Years Tower, he had been feeling a strong time law energy emanating from above, which was his motivation for moving forward. Now, it seemed that the energy was indeed the Years God Lamp, and he wondered what kind of treasure it was.

"Since this immortal estate is so secretive, how did you all find out about it?" Han Li asked, his curiosity piqued.

"This matter should be asked to Jiao San, as I and Huo San followed her here," said Shi Qinghou.

Han Li looked at Jiao San, his eyes filled with surprise.

"This matter involves the Wheel of Reincarnation's secrets, and even as the son of the Wheel of Reincarnation, you don't have the authority to know," said Jiao San, her eyes flashing with a hint of mystery.

Han Li didn't press the matter, his eyes gleaming with thought as he fell into contemplation.
