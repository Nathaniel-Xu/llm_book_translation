Han Li's fists were originally surrounded by a misty aura that spanned dozens of meters, but in the blink of an eye, it was compressed to only seven or eight meters. The green trees seemed to be about to crash into him.

His face showed no signs of abnormality, but in his heart, he let out a sigh. Earlier, he hadn't been able to instantly defeat Si Kongjian, and now things had indeed become troublesome.

As he pondered, he moved his hands, and each of them grasped a black giant sword.

The sword was taller than him, measuring two to three meters in length, and as wide as a door. It emitted a cold, eerie aura.

On the black sword, a giant dragon-shaped pattern was engraved, which was actually two star arrays, with point-like star patterns interspersed within. There were over two hundred of them.

These two giant swords were the Hei Long Sword, a weapon of Chang Qi, forged from the Nine Heavens' fallen iron to create a star device that could shatter anything.

Han Li let out a loud roar, and with a wave of his arm, the two giant swords transformed into black sword shadows that revolved and danced around him.

He didn't activate the power of the Hei Long Sword star device, instead relying solely on the sword itself to launch an attack.

Even so, the black sword shadows were far more destructive than the fist shadows, and the green trees that entered their range were instantly shredded.

"Roar!"

Han Li let out another loud roar towards Si Kongjian.

A white, misty sound wave shot out, but this time it didn't spread out. Instead, it condensed into a white sound wave that shot towards Si Kongjian.

The white sound wave's trajectory was marked by the destruction of the green trees, which were shattered like withered wood, creating a path about a meter wide.

Han Li's body transformed into a black shadow, following the path as he darted towards Si Kongjian like lightning.

Si Kongjian's eyes widened in shock, and he rapidly recited incantations, his hands forming a seal as a blinding green light appeared in his palm. Countless green runes danced within.

"Go!" he shouted, pushing his hands forward.

The green light shot out, and the surrounding trees converged towards it, merging into a single entity.

With a loud crash, a green giant dozens of meters tall materialized, its body surrounded by a green aura. A massive, earth-shattering wave of wood-elemental energy erupted from its body, causing the surrounding air to tremble.

The giant held a giant green knife, its blade wrapped in green runes, and with a swift motion, it sliced through the white sound wave.

The sound wave shattered, exploding into a thousand pieces.

The green knife paused, then continued to slash towards Han Li.

The entire spiritual realm's energy seemed to be mobilized by the green giant's attack, pressing down on Han Li with overwhelming force.

Han Li was now close to Si Kongjian, but he had no intention of engaging the giant. However, he had no choice but to swing his black dragon sword, striking the giant's knife.

The sword transformed into a black, lightning-fast slash, colliding with the green knife.

With a crisp cracking sound, the green knife shattered into two pieces, but the black dragon sword also developed a crack, eventually breaking apart.

However, Han Li didn't retreat. He vanished, reappearing in front of the green giant's head, his other hand wielding the black dragon sword, which transformed into a black slash that cut through the air, leaving a white mark.

The green giant's head was instantly severed.

Han Li stepped on the giant's shoulder, his body transforming into a residual shadow as he pounced towards Si Kongjian.

But just as he did, the green giant's body exploded with a loud crash, releasing countless green roots that shot out like living tendrils, binding Han Li's body.

The roots were covered in green runes, far more resilient than the previous trees, and they emitted a devouring energy that rapidly absorbed Han Li's spiritual energy.

Han Li's face changed, and he realized that these roots were not only absorbing his spiritual energy but also the energy he had borrowed from Chang Qi. If they continued to absorb it, his true form would be exposed.

He couldn't afford to hide his physical cultivation anymore, so he let out a loud roar, and the over 1,700 acupoints on his body burst forth with light.

A massive, earth-shattering energy erupted from his body, shattering the roots that bound him.

"Ah, Chang Qi's physical cultivation has reached such a realm, almost achieving physical perfection!" Pure Yuan True Person exclaimed, his face filled with surprise.

"Indeed, it's rare to see. I, Tian Tian, have secretly cultivated a batch of Xuan Sages, but Xuan Sage cultivation is extremely difficult. Few have managed to open over 1,000 acupoints. I wonder how he cultivated?" Feng Tian Xian said, sighing in amazement.

Tian Xing Zun was both shocked and delighted, glancing at Huo Yuan with a smug expression.

Huo Yuan's face, however, was stern, and he remained silent.
On the other side, Zhou Xianyang and the others were also stunned, their eyes wide with shock as they stood there.

Han Li's performance in the previous match had already shocked them, and they couldn't believe that Han Li's physical cultivation had reached such a level.

On the stage, Si Kongjian was shocked and hastily used his full strength to operate his spiritual domain. The green runes on the tree roots shone brightly, and he used all his might to bind Han Li.

However, Han Li's power was too great, and the tree roots continued to break apart, albeit at a slower pace. It seemed that he was about to break free.

Si Kongjian's face changed color, and he gritted his teeth, causing a burst of green light to erupt from his body, like a green sun.

He suddenly released a massive amount of spiritual pressure, far surpassing his previous level, and it was clear that he had reached the mid-stage of the Great Luo Realm.

However, Si Kongjian seemed to have just recently advanced to the mid-stage of the Great Luo Realm, and his aura was still unstable.

"This... Si Kongjian has indeed reached the mid-stage of the Great Luo Realm!" Zhou Xianyang's face twitched, and his excitement from Han Li's previous display of strength was replaced with a sinking feeling.

After all, in his opinion, if Si Kongjian was only at the early stage of the Great Luo Realm, Han Li might still be able to handle it. But if he was at the mid-stage, the gap was like a chasm, and the chances of winning were extremely slim.

The others from the Xianyang Sect, including Zhao Yuancheng, also looked on with changed expressions.

On the other hand, the Pure Jun True Person and the others on the high platform were calm and composed, as if they had already known about this.

Si Kongjian's body was surrounded by a green glow, and his fingers moved swiftly, as if plucking flowers.

A series of green crystal threads shot out from his fingertips, spinning around before transforming into green crystal rings that sank into the tree roots surrounding Han Li.

The tree roots suddenly grew thicker and more robust, and they emitted a powerful crystal light that resisted Han Li's explosive power.

Han Li was shocked, and his lips moved slightly as he prepared to unleash another "Tianyu Roar" to break free from the tree roots.

But just as he was about to do so, the green light around him flashed wildly, and a series of green trees emerged, wrapping around his body and forming a massive tree cocoon that was several dozen feet tall. The cocoon emitted a powerful wood element law.

Si Kongjian flipped his hand, and a green wooden ruler appeared, adorned with fiery red patterns that emitted a powerful wood element law and fire element law.

He rapidly recited incantations, and a series of green crystal rings flew out from his body, sinking into the wooden ruler.

The wooden ruler suddenly emitted a burst of green and red light, containing two distinct element laws that clashed intensely.

Si Kongjian pointed the wooden ruler at the void, and a green light ball appeared, but it was surrounded by a red flame.

The two element laws clashed intensely within the light ball, emitting a piercing shriek, but they did not explode.

"Go!" Si Kongjian shouted, and the green light ball shot out, initially the size of a human head, but rapidly growing to the size of a house.

It struck the green tree cocoon, merging with it and disappearing.

A powerful fire element law burst out from the cocoon, and a series of dazzling red lights erupted from the cracks in the cocoon.

The originally green cocoon was now engulfed in flames, shrinking rapidly in size and transforming into a spherical shape. The intense wood element law and fire element law within the cocoon clashed intensely, yet complemented each other.

"This is... the Wood God's Thunderbolt!" a voice exclaimed from the stone platform.

The speaker was none other than the beautiful and elegant Red Dream, who gazed at the spherical cocoon with a flicker of surprise in her eyes.

"Wood God's Thunderbolt? Could it be the signature technique of the Wood King Xianzun, the renowned master of the Wood Element Law?" the Pure Jun True Person asked, turning to Red Dream.

The others on the stone platform also turned to Red Dream, their faces filled with curiosity.

Red Dream's eyes sparkled as she began to explain, "It is indeed the Wood God's Thunderbolt, a technique that combines the Wood Element Law and the Fire Element Law. The Wood King Xianzun had once used this technique to defeat a Great Luo Realm cultivator, and it was said that he had even used it to hold off two Great Luo Realm cultivators. Its power is truly formidable... But alas, the Wood King Xianzun was later punished by our sect's Xuanhuo Daozu for his arrogance, and he was severely injured. He disappeared afterwards, and it seems that he has fallen. The wooden ruler in Si Kongjian's hand is likely the Wood King Xianzun's treasured artifact, the Wood King Ruler. Si Kongjian's possession of this artifact explains why he was able to advance to the mid-stage of the Great Luo Realm. However, he has not fully inherited the Wood King Xianzun's divine abilities, and this Wood God's Thunderbolt is merely a shadow of the original technique, reliant on the power of the Wood King Ruler."

The Pure Jun True Person's voice was calm and composed as he spoke, "Although the Wood God's Thunderbolt is not as powerful as the original, it is still a formidable technique. This match is indeed becoming more interesting."

As the Pure Jun True Person finished speaking, a deafening explosion shook the stage, and the Wood God's Thunderbolt burst forth.

A massive red and green light sphere erupted, shattering the surrounding void and creating a massive black hole that swallowed everything in its vicinity.

The stage creaked and groaned under the intense pressure, but fortunately, the Pure Jun True Person had previously reinforced the stage and the surrounding restrictions, preventing a complete collapse.

As the audience watched in awe, they turned their attention to the center of the stage.

Han Li's figure had vanished, consumed by the black hole.

The outcome of the match was still uncertain, but one thing was clear: the battle between Han Li and Si Kongjian had reached a new level of intensity.
