At the same time, a slim figure suddenly flipped out from behind the golden shield, like a nimble golden monkey, directly leaping over E Tui's head, holding a huge golden sword in his hand, and fiercely slashing down at his neck.

The golden greatsword was covered in dense star holes, and the moment it slashed down, the star power contained within it almost simultaneously erupted, making it seem as if the sword was enveloped in a layer of serrated sword energy.

However, when the golden sword slashed down, the star power that burst out collided with the layer of blood mist covering E Tui's body, causing sparks to fly and a series of sharp, ringing sounds to explode.

Although the sword's momentum was extremely fierce, it couldn't break through the layer of blood mist and couldn't cut through at all.

"Trivial tricks!" E Tui said disdainfully.

As soon as he finished speaking, the fist that was slamming into the golden shield suddenly retracted, and when it struck again, his entire right arm seemed to have suddenly thickened, the bulging muscle lines like carved with a blade, filled with explosive power.

With a loud bang!

E Tui's fist slammed into the golden shield.

On the huge shield, star holes flickered wildly, sending out layer upon layer of impact force.

However, E Tui crouched down, letting the force wash over him, and directly sent the puppet holding the sword behind him flying out.

At the same time, his right fist struck the golden shield again, and before the sound waves could rebound, his left fist followed, slamming heavily into the surface of the golden shield.

There was a loud rumbling sound!

E Tui's fists were like a storm, continuously pounding on the shield.

The sound waves that should have been rebounding off the golden shield were instead being pounded down, accumulating and compressing on the shield's surface.

In just an instant, the shield's limit was breached.

A deafening explosion rang out.

The golden shield burst apart with a loud bang, and an incomparably powerful force erupted, directly blasting the puppet holding the shield away.

E Tui retreated a few steps, his legs sinking into the ground, stabilizing himself.

At this moment, Han Li's figure seemed to be unaffected by the storm's impact, stepping on air, his entire body like a leaf in the wind, his feet slamming, he flashed a few times and arrived at E Tui's head.

He saw him flip over and dive, his body's Heavenly Demon Suppressing Prison Skill operating at full power, more than four hundred mysterious holes all over his body lighting up, and he fiercely slammed a fist towards E Tui's Baihui acupoint on the crown of his head.

At the end of his fist, star power gathered, condensing into a streak of white fist shadow that seemed to be solid, the surface sparkling, as if inlaid with a piece of void star, the power contained within it even more astonishing.

Although E Tui had been paying attention to Han Li's movements, he still didn't expect him to make a move at this moment, and in his panic, he couldn't make more defenses, and could only tilt his head fiercely, operating his cultivation technique to the limit, to withstand this blow.

Han Li's fist grazed past E Tui's head, but the snow-white fist shadow still left a distinct imprint on his face as it heavily slammed onto his shoulder.

With a loud bang!

The ground under E Tui's feet exploded, countless fragments of rock flying up and turning into dust.

As for him, he fell to one side, his entire body buried in the rubble.

Han Li didn't pause at all, his arms shook, and fist shadows like meteors rained down, a series of chaotic explosions ringing out, the earth shaking greatly, and dust spreading.

Lady Liu Hua watched this scene from afar, and her eyes also flashed with amazement.

As the earth continued to crumble, Han Li and E Tui's figures fell into a deep pit underground, no longer visible.

After a while, a loud rumble came!

Han Li's figure suddenly flew out from underground, flying into the sky, and fell outside.

Immediately afterwards, a figure covered in purple-red followed closely, it was E Tui.

His body had wounds all over, looking bloody, but in fact they were only superficial injuries, not important at all, but being suppressed by Han Li and madly beaten into the ground like that, made him furious.

After E Tui emerged from the ground, he landed and looked at Han Li who was stumbling to his feet not far away, and sneered, "No wonder you kid can have such achievements, it turns out you also cultivated the Heavenly Demon Suppressing Prison Skill, I just don't know which statue you have on you."

After the previous exchange, Han Li naturally could also see that E Tui had similarly cultivated the Heavenly Demon Suppressing Prison Skill, and his cultivation was far above his own.

"I wonder which statue Lord E has cultivated?" Han Li spat out a mouthful of blood foam and smiled back.

"The four statues were deliberately scattered by the Demon Lord back then, I only got two of them, I think the one you have is either the first or the fourth, either way, it's fine!" E Tui said greedily.

"How about we swap them?" Han Li suddenly raised his eyebrows and said.

"Haha... at this time, Fellow Li, don't joke around, okay?" E Tui heard the words and laughed, then said.

As soon as his voice fell, the ground under his feet suddenly shattered, and a golden figure silently charged out, his arms slipped under E Tui's armpits, and he fiercely clasped upwards, tightly clamping him.

The golden figure was none other than the shield puppet that lost its shield, and the sound of its gears turning on its body kept ringing, the golden armor on its body actually split open, like a golden hoop, binding E Tui.

On the golden hoops, dense runes were packed, and the imprisoning power was incomparably strong.
At the same time, the sword-wielding puppet abruptly emerged from the ground, discarded its sword, and leaped to the position in front of E'kuī's chest. The puppet's body also emitted a clanging sound as the golden armor on its body split and fused with the shield-wielding puppet.

"Rebel, die!" A frenzied roar came from the distance. It was Sha Xin's enraged shout.

Before he finished speaking, the runes on the two golden-armored puppets burst into dazzling light, turning into a blinding white glow that exploded with a boom.

"Rumble..."

A deafening sound rang out, and under the night sky, it seemed as if a scorching sun had risen, illuminating the entire sky with a blinding light that made it impossible to open one's eyes.

Han Li was already aware of this and had rapidly retreated, avoiding the blast.

The violent shockwave swept through the sky and earth, making it impossible for anyone to see what was happening.

After a while, the turmoil gradually subsided, and the dust dispersed.

Han Li saw that where he had been standing, there was now a huge, deep black pit.

E'kuī stood alone at the bottom of the pit, his clothes tattered and his skin an incomparably dark black. However, it was not the kind of charred black from being burned by intense flames, but a wrinkled, eerie dark gloss.

On the contrary, the jujube-red mark between his eyebrows had now turned snow-white.

"Hehe..."

E'kuī emitted waves of eerie laughter that made people's hearts palpitate. His figure turned into a wisp of green smoke and disappeared from where he was.

In the next instant, a loud rumble came from a great distance away. Sha Xin's figure was smashed into the high sky.

E'kuī's dark figure closely pursued, throwing out a hundred punches in the blink of an eye.

"Boom boom boom..."

Sha Xin's body continuously exploded, like a puddle of mud falling from the sky, his life uncertain.

"His speed is faster, and his power is stronger..." Han Li watched this scene with an extremely solemn expression.

"Don't worry, it's your turn!" E'kuī landed and turned to look at Han Li, saying slowly.

His voice seemed to have changed, making people feel extremely uncomfortable hearing it.

In the next instant, Han Li's pupils shrank sharply. His toes fiercely kicked off the ground, and his figure rapidly retreated backward.

However, his vision still suddenly blurred. That black figure had already caught up.

E'kuī's eyes were filled with bloodshot veins, and his sanity seemed to have dissipated. He raised his fist, and starlight exploded like the scorching sun, blasting straight towards Han Li's chest.

Han Li dared not to be careless in the slightest. He secretly activated the Heaven Slaying Prison Technique while also mobilizing the bloodline power within his body.

The profound light on his arms suddenly brightened. The muscles of his arms swelled up as if inflated, like two city gate doors, blocking in front of him.

At the same time, Han Li suddenly felt a very strange sensation. His arms seemed to have gained an extra special power. It was different from when he used the True Spirit Bloodline power and activated the Heaven Slaying Prison Technique before, yet it seemed to be faintly related.

Boom!

Before he could figure it out, an extremely violent force had already rushed over, crashing into his arms.

Han Li's arm bones shook violently. He felt an immense pressure accompanied by sharp pain suddenly assault him, as if they were about to shatter.

Then, his body was sent flying backwards. He left a thousands-of-zhang-long, nearly hundred-zhang-wide trench on the ground before crashing into a rock wall and stopping.

The entire rock wall, hundreds of zhang high, shattered with a rumble. Rolling stones smashed down, burying Han Li within.

Han Li felt his arms go numb. He moved them a bit, but they were not broken.

At this moment, E'kuī was utilizing the most dangerous Star Blood Ignition technique of the Blood Ignition Secret Art. This technique grew more backlash the longer it was used, so he naturally wanted to end the battle quickly. He wasn't willing to give Han Li a single moment to breathe, already chasing him and attacking once more.

His fist was like a violent storm, continuously striking the rubble. The rumbling sounds were like rolling black thunder, shocking the heavens.

The already shattered mountain wall now thoroughly turned into dust.

From the dust, a fierce roar suddenly rang out. A mountain-like giant ape with golden fur burst out from within. It raised an incomparably huge fist and smashed it towards E'kuī's head.

E'kuī's entire body was not even as large as the giant ape's fist, but he still reached out with a punch.

Boom!

A huge explosive sound rang out, like the eruption of a volcano. A violent force burst out, carrying a shockingly powerful force that even surprised Han Li himself as it surged towards E'kuī.

A flash of surprise flickered in E'kuī's eyes. His body was actually sent flying back by the giant ape's punch.

Han Li wasn't in a good state either. His massive body fell backwards, crashing to the ground once more.

The fallen giant ape then rolled and transformed into a Thunder Roc as silver electric threads surged out from its body. It spread its wings and swiftly glided close to the ground.

"Trying to escape... Where do you think you're going?" E'kuī's pupils contracted as he let out a furious shout.
