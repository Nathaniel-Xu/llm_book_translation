Liu Le'er's entire body was enveloped in a gray-white aura, and her slender figure trembled as a look of pain appeared on her face.

The gray-white patterns on her body flashed violently, rapidly growing thicker and more complex as they spread throughout her body. In an instant, they covered her entire body.

Behind her, the illusory image of the Heavenly Fox also rapidly brightened, and her tail grew longer and more majestic as it flashed with light.

Seven tails, eight tails... finally, she transformed into a nine-tailed Heavenly Fox.

As the Heavenly Fox's image transformed into a nine-tailed one, Liu Le'er's face showed a slight reduction in pain. She took a deep breath, sat down cross-legged, and her body's gray-white aura flashed wildly as she fully accepted the transmission of the Heavenly Fox's bloodline.

Han Li's eyes showed a hint of joy, and he let out a sigh of relief.

Liu Qing, as well as the other members of the Heavenly Fox tribe, revealed joyful expressions, cheering and applauding.

The other tribes also showed joyful expressions, nodding in agreement.

Compared to Liu Tianhao, whose origins were unknown, they had always hoped that Liu Le'er would inherit the nine-tailed Heavenly Fox bloodline, because in their eyes, Liu Le'er was trustworthy, whereas the former was not.

Bai Ze's face showed no expression, but his eyes flashed with a hint of excitement, as if he was also pleased with this turn of events.

Liu Tianhao stood frozen in place, his face twisted in a scowl, his eyes flashing with a hint of resentment. But with Bai Ze standing beside him, he didn't dare to make a move.

As Liu Le'er began to inherit the nine-tailed Heavenly Fox bloodline, the other cultivators, including Qing, Xiao Bai, and the white-haired youth from the Zhuwu tribe, also began to accept their respective True Spirit King bloodlines.

Just as this was happening, a sudden change occurred!

The blood-red stone pillar of the Lei Peng tribe shook violently, and the flames of the Wildfire erupted, growing several times larger and more intense.

The blood-red space began to shake violently, and a deafening roar echoed from outside.

The faces of the cultivators changed dramatically, and regardless of their cultivation level, their spirits were shaken, and their bodies stumbled backward.

The nine-tailed Heavenly Fox and the other four True Spirit King bloodlines glowed brightly, protecting Liu Le'er and the others as they absorbed the bloodline energy.

Han Li's spirit was also shaken, and he hastily activated his Refining Spirit technique, trying to calm his mind and gaze outward.

At this moment, the sky above the Eight Desolations Mountain was filled with wind and clouds, and countless dark clouds appeared, carrying thick and heavy lightning bolts that flashed and boomed. Countless black whirlwinds shot down from the clouds, connecting the earth and the sky, as if the end of the world had arrived.

The entire Eight Desolations Mountain trembled, as if it would be engulfed by the dark clouds at any moment.

The cultivators of the Eight Desolations Mountain were shocked, their faces pale and panicked, as they hastily activated their local restrictions, releasing a brilliant light that pierced the sky. However, compared to the dark clouds, their efforts seemed like a mere spark compared to the brilliance of the moon.

In the depths of the dark clouds, a gigantic black shadow could be seen, slowly moving, as if it was a colossal beast that filled the entire sky, its size impossible to comprehend.

Occasionally, a scale or claw would flash out from the clouds, causing the cultivators to gasp in shock at the sheer scale of the beast. They could only hear the thunderous roars echoing from the clouds.

In the blood-red space, Bai Ze's face showed a hint of joy, and his eyes flashed with two strange lights as he gazed outward.

Liu Tianhao's eyes widened as he saw the scene, and his body suddenly disappeared, only to reappear beside the nine-tailed Heavenly Fox's illusory image. His massive hand grasped downward, attempting to seize the bloodline energy.

A colossal force erupted from Liu Tianhao's hand, enveloping the nine-tailed Heavenly Fox bloodline energy, trying to forcefully absorb it.

"Presumptuous!" Bai Ze suddenly turned around, his voice cold and stern.

The sound was not loud, but the entire blood-red space froze, and Liu Tianhao's force was halted, unable to move forward.

Liu Tianhao's heart sank, and he tried to retreat, but his body was also frozen in place by an invisible force, unable to move.

Liu Tianhao's heart sank further, and he realized he was in grave danger.

"You dare to act violently in front of me? It seems you're tired of living." Bai Ze's face turned cold and stern, his finger pointing at Liu Tianhao.

A massive finger shadow appeared in front of Liu Tianhao, pointing at his chest.

With a loud "pu" sound, Liu Tianhao's chest was pierced, and a massive amount of blood spewed out, his body almost severed in two.

Liu Tianhao spat out blood, but his body flashed with a gray-white light, and he transformed into a transparent state, disappearing into nothingness.

"Illusory dream? Ha!"

Bai Ze's eyebrows rose, and he suddenly waved his sleeve, releasing a massive, invisible force that swept through the entire blood-red space.

A hundred meters away, a gray-white light burst forth, and Liu Tianhao's body reappeared, flying backward as he spat out another mouthful of blood.

"Universal phenomena"

Liu Tianhao gritted his teeth, his hands forming a wheel-like gesture as he unleashed a dense, gray-white light that exploded, transforming into countless illusions - sun, moon, stars, mountains, trees, flowers, cities, palaces, lightning, fire, and people.
The vast world of the universe presented all sorts of imaginable things, filling the entire crimson space with a kaleidoscope of colors, flashing and jumping about, making one's heart and soul unable to resist being immersed in it.

The eyes of everyone in the space showed a dazed expression, and their eyes, which had been shining brightly, suddenly became dull. It seemed as if the divine soul of everyone was being devoured by the illusionary world before them.

Bai Ze's face turned solemn, and his five fingers shone with a brilliant white light. He waved his hand in the air.

With a "whooshing" sound, all the illusions disappeared.

Liu Tian Hao's figure had already vanished, and it was unknown where he had gone.

The people present suddenly regained their consciousness, and they all gasped for breath.

Han Li's breathing was rapid, and his eyes showed a hint of fear.

He had just felt that his divine soul was about to leave his body, and was about to be taken away.

Bai Ze didn't pay attention to Han Li and the others, and his right hand grasped at a place in the crimson space. A white light palm shot out.

That place in the space made a "whooshing" sound, and it shattered like paper. A figure fell from it, and it was Liu Tian Hao. He was about to fall into the white light palm.

At this moment, the shattered void violently shook, and a massive power seeped out from it, blocking Bai Ze's white light palm.

Then, Liu Tian Hao's figure flickered, and he vanished into thin air.

The massive power in the void also suddenly dissipated, and it disappeared without a trace. The ripples that had formed also dissipated.

"Someone actually came to his aid..." Bai Ze's eyebrows furrowed, and he muttered to himself.

Liu Zi and the others were also staring at each other in dismay, and they didn't know what had happened.

Liu Qing saw the situation, and she opened her mouth, looking like she wanted to say something. But before she could speak, Bai Ze's gaze turned to Liu Le Er, and he said:

"This matter will be investigated later. For now, the most important thing is the bloodline inheritance. Don't be affected by this, and focus on doing what you should be doing."

Liu Le Er let out a light sigh, and she nodded.

Bai Ze turned his head to look at the top of the eight stone pillars, and his hands beckoned. Eight golden flames flew out from the pillars, and they condensed into a single ball, burning fiercely.

Then, he waved his hands and cast a few spells, and his palms pushed out towards the void behind the pillars.

The golden flames shot out, and they landed on the square behind the pillars. With a "whooshing" sound, they exploded into countless golden flames, and they ignited the void.

Immediately after, the eight stone pillars emitted a brilliant crimson light, and one after another, the true spirit shadows flew out, appearing in the void with a wild and unrestrained manner, and they charged into the blood clouds above, shining with a brilliant light.

"Whooshing..."

Along with the sound of the flames rising, the blood clouds above also began to churn, and a large amount of crimson light fell from the clouds, connecting with the golden flames below.

The void began to produce a powerful fluctuation, and it contained a wild and primitive aura.

"Rumbling..."

Along with the void's turbulent movements, the golden flames and the crimson light actually formed three massive gates, each over a hundred feet tall.

The three gates were arranged in a row, with a distance of several dozen feet between each gate. The lower part of the gates was being incinerated by the golden flames, and they shone with a golden color. The upper part seemed to be made of copper, and it emitted a metallic luster.

Everyone's eyes widened in shock, and even Han Li, a member of the human tribe, felt a sense of reverence in his heart when he saw the three copper gates appear.

Many of the barbarian tribes' people couldn't help but feel a desire to bow down.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and his gaze moved from the leftmost gate to the right, examining each gate one by one.

He saw that the first gate, although it had a very ancient aura, seemed to be man-made, and it had eight true spirit carvings on it. The carvings depicted eight true spirit kings with different postures, but they all had an extraordinary divine aura.

Unlike the ones he had seen before, the true spirit carvings on the gate had a very strong true spirit aura, and Han Li felt a suffocating pressure when he looked at it, making him quickly look away.

The second gate had carvings on it, but they were very rough, and they only had some coarse lines that outlined a desolate landscape of the barbarian world.

When Han Li's gaze fell on it, he felt a strange sensation.

He only felt that the scenery on the gate suddenly came to life, and it turned into a sea of blood that enveloped him, making him feel like he was being pulled into that world.

Han Li felt like his body was being burned by flames, and he was being boiled in oil, making him feel extremely uncomfortable. But the true spirit bloodline in his body seemed to have finally found a place that belonged to them, and it was wildly running amok, making him feel extremely carefree.

Han Li's body suddenly felt hot, and his face and neck turned red.

Everyone else was attracted to the gates, and only Bai Ze felt a sense of awareness, and he looked at Han Li.

His gaze flashed, and his eyes showed a hint of surprise.

However, he didn't take any action, and he didn't try to help Han Li. Instead, he continued to observe, seemingly wanting to see how long it would take Han Li to escape from this strange state.
