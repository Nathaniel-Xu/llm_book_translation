"Haha, it seems that Huyan Daoist's harvest over the years is indeed not small, and he can enjoy these fine wines and jade dew every day, earning him the title of 'Wine Immortal'." Han Li said with a smile.

"Ah, I have collected many fine wines, but unfortunately, I have no one to share them with. Today, you young one has arrived, and I can finally drink to my heart's content." Huyan Daoist laughed.

"Of course, I'll accompany you." Han Li naturally wouldn't refuse.

The two sat down at the table, and Huyan Daoist took out the fine wines he had collected over the years. As they chatted about their experiences, they drank freely.

Soon, both of them were somewhat intoxicated.

Han Li mentioned the scene he had witnessed at the Candle Dragon Dao a while back.

Huyan Daoist had stayed at the Candle Dragon Dao for a longer time than Han Li, and his emotions were more deeply rooted. Upon hearing Han Li's words, he was shocked and couldn't help but sigh.

"Once this great calamity passes, Huyan Daoist, if you have the heart, you can return to the Northern Cold Immortal Domain and revive the Candle Dragon Dao. Don't worry about resources, I can lend you a hand." Han Li said, seeing the look on Huyan Daoist's face.

His "True Word Transformation Scripture" had come from the Candle Dragon Dao, and he had a few ties to the place.

With his current cultivation and wealth, reviving the Candle Dragon Dao was a trivial matter. A while back, when he was at the Candle Dragon Dao, he had focused on cultivating and hadn't had time to attend to this matter.

"Haha, you young one has a big mouth, it seems you really have some abilities. However, the rise and fall of all things are governed by their natural order, and the same applies to the prosperity and decline of sects. One shouldn't interfere, and we'll see about it in the future." Huyan Daoist looked at Han Li in surprise, then smiled faintly and raised his cup to drink.

"Huyan Daoist's personality is still the same, but his actions have changed greatly since the past." Han Li's eyebrows twitched, and he said thoughtfully.

"After experiencing so many things, especially the great decline in my power, I've come to realize that many things are just fleeting clouds. Grudges and favors are all just clouds. It's pointless to think too much about them, and it's better to just enjoy the wine and sing." Huyan Daoist laughed.

"Grudges and favors are all just clouds... all just clouds..." Han Li muttered.

"Now, I am no longer the same person I was in the past. As for the future, I don't know what it holds, and I don't want to know. I've long since stopped being attached to my future self. As the saying goes, 'Today, I have wine, today, I am drunk'!" Huyan Daoist shook his head, swaying back and forth, and poured himself another cup.

"That's right, it's not just grudges and favors, but also friendships, love, suffering, and joy. They're all just the mind's attachment to the past, present, and future. In reality, they're not worth worrying about, and it's not worth dwelling on." Han Li's eyes flashed with insight, and he muttered to himself.

Huyan Daoist looked at Han Li with an empty wine cup, his gaze strange and puzzled.

"Similarly, the flesh is born from the essence of the father and the blood of the mother. From the moment one embarks on the path of cultivation, one absorbs the energy of heaven and earth, and the flesh and blood of the body are constantly changing. Even at my current level, I am changing every moment." Han Li said, his eyes slowly brightening.

"Since we shouldn't be attached to the flesh and consciousness, I am not I, you are not you, and he is not he. We are all just illusions, just fleeting clouds. However, these illusions are not nonexistent, just like how I am here drinking with you now, everything has its cause and follows its natural order..." Han Li continued.

Huyan Daoist shook his head, not paying attention to Han Li, and drank three more cups of wine on his own.

"Thank you, Huyan Daoist." Han Li stood up suddenly, bowing to Huyan Daoist.

"Hey, young one, what are you doing?" Huyan Daoist saw this and also stood up quickly.

"Huyan Daoist's words just now resolved a knot in my cultivation." Han Li didn't explain further.

Huyan Daoist listened to Han Li's words, and he didn't say much, just laughing loudly.

The two of them didn't discuss cultivation anymore, and they drank and reminisced about the past, chatting about the vast expanse of the immortal path.

Those fine wines were all infused with spiritual energy, and many of them contained boundless immortal energy. With Huyan Daoist's current cultivation level, he naturally became drunk quickly.

Han Li helped Huyan Daoist to bed, and his divine sense scanned Huyan Daoist's body, his brow furrowed in concern. Then, he pushed the door open and walked out.

The sky was already completely dark, with a bright, white moon hanging in the air like a silver plate, casting a large patch of silver light.

The valley was quiet, with the pavilion next door already dark and still. Nangong Wan and Yun Nie seemed to have both retired for the night.

Han Li hadn't seen such a peaceful night in a long time, and he couldn't help but stroll around the valley, enjoying the rare tranquility.

"Senior Li." A voice came from in front of him, and a white-clad figure emerged from the bamboo forest nearby. It was Bai Suxian.

She was wearing a white long dress, and her beauty was even more striking.

"Suxian, why are you still not resting at this late hour?" Han Li asked.

"Senior Li, with your profound cultivation, you should have already seen Huyan Daoist's current condition, right?" Bai Suxian asked after a moment of silence.

"Huyan Daoist's body has suffered severe damage to his primordial energy, and it doesn't seem to be due to injury. This situation, I've seen before in some cultivation techniques."

"You're right, Senior Li. Huyan Daoist's cultivation has indeed declined greatly, but it's not because of an injury. It's all because of me." Bai Suxian said softly.

Han Li didn't show any surprise, standing quietly and waiting for her to continue.

"Huyan Daoist did indeed fight with someone and was injured, but it didn't affect his foundation. Originally, he would have recovered after a period of cultivation. However, I was seeking revenge for my master's death at the time, and I didn't prepare properly before attempting to break through to the Golden Immortal realm. As a result, my meridians were severely damaged, and I almost lost my life. Huyan Daoist, in order to save me, disregarded his own injuries and used his primordial energy to help me suppress the damage. Later, he even helped me break through, but he himself ended up with a severely damaged body and a decline in his cultivation." Bai Suxian said sorrowfully.

"I see," Han Li sighed.

Bai Suxian took a step forward and knelt down in front of Han Li.

"Huyan Daoist's condition requires a Taoyi realm expert to treat, and Senior Li, you have already reached the Taoyi realm. I beg of you, please lend a hand and help him. I am willing to become your servant or maid to repay your kindness." Bai Suxian's eyes were filled with tears, and her voice was trembling.

Han Li's eyebrows twitched, and he waved his sleeve.

Bai Suxian's body was lifted by a gentle force, and she stood up.

"I am an old acquaintance of Huyan Daoist, and he just helped me with a big favor. You don't need to ask, I will help him recover." Han Li said calmly.

He took out a white jade bottle and handed it to Bai Suxian.
Bai Su'yan was both startled and delighted, nervously receiving the medicine bottle, a refreshing and fragrant aroma wafting out through the bottle wall.

Her spirit was greatly lifted, and the immortal energy within her body began to stir, her heart filled with joy once again.

"There are ten pills of Xianzhi Zengyuan Dan inside the bottle, which can best make up for the loss of your original energy. Let Huayan Daoist take one pill every ten days, and within two months, his energy will be restored. As for his cultivation, as long as he diligently practices, he will quickly recover to his original state," Han Li said.

"Thank you, Elder Lian," Bai Su'yan was overjoyed, bowing again to thank him.

"You can go, I quite like the moonlight here, I'd like to take a look," Han Li said calmly, waving his hand, and then continued walking forward.

Bai Su'yan hesitated for a moment, bowed to Han Li's back, and retreated.

Han Li strolled through the valley, soon arriving at a small pavilion deep in a bamboo forest.

A woman in white stood there, it was Nangong Wan.

But at this moment, she was surrounded by an invisible wave of water, making her figure seem vague and indistinct.

"Husband, I was going to repay you for your kindness, why are you treating me so coldly?" Nangong Wan said with a smile that was not quite a smile.

"That bottle of Xianzhi Zengyuan Dan can cure Huayan Daoist's injuries, and that's already repaying him. Let's go, the cause and effect here have already been resolved, and this is no longer a place for us to stay," Han Li said with a smile, shaking his head, and taking Nangong Wan's hand.

A flash of lightning, and the two of them disappeared from the valley.

The next moment, they appeared in mid-air.

"Where are we going next?" Nangong Wan asked, her face seeming to relax.

"The Heavenly Domain," Han Li's eyes flashed with a fierce light, and he took Nangong Wan with him as they soared into the sky.

Soon, they arrived at the Heavenly Domain, and found a safe place to set up a simple cave.

He then took Nangong Wan into the Flower Branch Space.

"Husband, are you going to continue your previous cultivation?" Nangong Wan looked at Han Li.

Han Li nodded lightly.

"Husband's cultivation, I'm afraid I can't help with, but I believe that my husband will definitely succeed," Nangong Wan said with a slight bow.

"Your trust, my dear, is the greatest support for me," Han Li hugged Nangong Wan, and lightly kissed her forehead, then turned and entered the attic where he had previously gone into seclusion.

The restrictions on the attic floor were still in place, operating normally.

Han Li sat down cross-legged within the restrictions, calming his heart and mind.

A day and night passed, and his heart was completely calm, and he once again entered the spiritual realm.

The cyan-robed Han Li sat as before, looking up at him.

He examined Han Li up and down, his expression becoming solemn.

"Heh heh, your heart has made great progress, it seems that you've come this time to truly start the Corpse Severing," the cyan-robed Han Li said.

"Not bad," Han Li didn't waste any words, his body flashing with a burst of golden light, instantly forming a spiritual domain that enveloped him.

Unexpectedly, the cyan-robed Han Li didn't dodge, allowing Han Li's spiritual domain to envelop him.

Han Li's eyes flickered slightly, and he cast a spell, his brow shining with a bright light.

The cyan-robed Han Li's surroundings began to move, and countless crystal chains shot out, binding him tightly.

The cyan-robed Han Li was not worried about his situation, and even had a smile on his face.

Everything around Han Li disappeared, including the spiritual realm and the cyan-robed Han Li, leaving only endless darkness.

"An illusion?" Han Li looked around, immediately activating the Refining Spirit Technique, his brow shining with a brilliant light.

A series of powerful spiritual fluctuations shot out, transforming into giant spiritual swords that slashed at the surrounding space.

But the black space only rippled slightly, and the spiritual swords were swallowed up without causing any waves.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he was inwardly shocked.

Over the years, his continuous battles with his own corpse had allowed his Refining Spirit Technique to advance, and it had almost reached the seventh layer of the Great Perfection, his spiritual power was incredibly strong, and even if a Dao Ancestor who cultivated illusion techniques were to set up an illusion space, he could still shake it.

At this moment, the scenery around him changed, and the black space disappeared, revealing a blood pool.

The blood pool was filled with thick, viscous blood, emitting a nauseating stench.

"Roar!" Five ghostly creatures with green faces and sharp teeth jumped out of the blood pool, charging towards Han Li.

These ghostly creatures were extremely ferocious, their bodies covered in blood-red blisters, constantly spewing out foul-smelling blood, their snake-like eyes filled with a blood-red glow, their sides covered in seven or eight arms, each arm ending in a different type of sharp claw, each one ugly and ferocious, making one's hair stand on end.

These five ghostly creatures seemed to have gathered all the ferocity and ugliness in the world, their expressions even more ferocious, as if they wanted to devour people and drink their blood.
