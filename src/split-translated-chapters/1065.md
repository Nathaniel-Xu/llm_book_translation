A burst of golden lightning erupted from the thirty-six Qingtian Bee Cloud Swords, mixing with the sword energy to engulf the Wū Cháo Ghost King.

"Ah..."

A violent roar echoed from the Ghost King's mouth as his body was covered in numerous dense wounds, with bloodlight flashing and black smoke rising.

He turned his head to look at Han Li, who was charging towards him with large strides, and immediately spat out a mouthful of air.

A loud "whoosh" sound erupted as a dense black flame burst out from his mouth, instantly forming a black fire wall that pushed forward, layer upon layer, overwhelming the surroundings.

Han Li's eyes flashed, but he didn't move, completely unresponsive.

A silver light flashed from his side, transforming into a giant silver firebird with seven-colored flames on its head, its body enormous, with wings that stretched over a thousand feet wide. With a single flap, it was like a giant silver blade, cutting through the black fire wall with ease.

The silver firebird's body charged through the center of the fire wall, its wings pushing out flames that parted to reveal a wide, open road.

Han Li's shadow flashed through the opening, his body surrounded by a silver electric glow as the power of the Lei Peng surged, his massive body appearing beside the Wū Cháo Ghost King in an instant. He punched out with a loud "boom".

The Wū Cháo Ghost King stumbled, his massive body tilting to the side, his hand holding the white bone trident wavering.

A "buzz" sound erupted as the bloodlight from the Qì Hún's eyes shot into the Ghost King's shoulder.

The Wū Cháo Ghost King let out a mournful wail, his shoulder armor melting away, revealing a giant blood hole that spewed out dark liquid.

"You're courting death, I'll crush your bones to dust!"

A sharp, ear-piercing shriek echoed from his mouth, his body surrounded by a surge of black energy, as countless dark ghostly shadows shot out from within, tearing at Han Li and Qì Hún.

The ghostly shadows seemed real, yet intangible, dispersing like smoke when Han Li tried to punch them. Unable to land a hit, Han Li recalled the Qingtian Bee Cloud Swords to surround him, releasing the Xié Yī Shén Léi to drive them back.

However, these ghostly shadows seemed to defy the Xié Yī Shén Léi, dispersing momentarily before recondensing and reappearing.

Moreover, whenever they approached Han Li, he felt an eerie, yin-yang energy seeping into his bones, as if it came from the underworld.

As the attacks continued, the yin-yang energy accumulated within him, and his body began to feel an icy, bone-chilling cold.

Qì Hún, on the other hand, was faring worse, her movements slowing, struggling to keep up with the Wū Cháo Ghost King's attacks.

If they continued to fight like this, they would surely be defeated.

Just as Han Li's thoughts reached this point, he suddenly had an idea.

"Qì Hún, come back!"

His mind stirred, and the Jīng Huǒ Firebird, which had been consuming the black fire wall, flew back into his body.

Han Li felt a surge of heat, the icy coldness dissipating, and his body returned to its original state. The silver electric glow on his body flashed, and he appeared before the Wū Cháo Ghost King.

The Wū Cháo Ghost King swung his white bone trident, trying to sweep Han Li away.

Han Li saw this and reached for the green gourd hanging from his waist, which he had picked up earlier. He poured the contents of the gourd towards the Wū Cháo Ghost King.

A "boom" sound erupted as the green vortex at the mouth of the gourd spun wildly, and a golden flame dragon burst out, charging towards the Ghost King.

This dragon was the same one that Qí Mó Zǐ had attacked Han Li with earlier, but after being trapped in the Xuán Tiān Gourd for a while, its size and speed had decreased significantly. However, its passage still distorted the space-time continuum, slowing down everything around it.

The Wū Cháo Ghost King, already exhausted from fighting Qì Hún and Han Li, saw the dragon approaching and hastily threw his white bone trident.

The dragon's speed was incredible, and the trident barely had time to fly out before colliding with the dragon.

A deafening "boom" sound shook the air.

The golden flame dragon exploded, releasing a burst of golden spiritual flames that engulfed the Wū Cháo Ghost King.

"Time..." The Wū Cháo Ghost King, caught in the explosion, felt an eerie power take hold of him, his mind going blank as his entire body was frozen in place.

A moment later, the golden flame dragon's explosion began to dissipate, and the affected area began to shrink.
As the power of the Time Law within the Lingyan reduced to half, the consciousness in Wu Chao's mind also recovered. When his thoughts were still lingering on the "Time Law's power...", Han Li's figure suddenly appeared from afar.

His body was fully activated with the Tianxie Zhenyin Gong, and the thirty-six Qingzhu Fengyun swords in his hand merged into one. The sword light and lightning burst forth simultaneously, sweeping horizontally towards Wu Chao's neck.

A loud crack of thunder sounded, followed by a crisp "crack" sound. Wu Chao's head had already flown high into the air, his eyes wide open, and his body rolled to the ground with a "gulugulu" sound.

There was no blood flowing from his severed neck, only countless dark and sinister ghostly spirits pouring out, like a flock of crows taking flight, emitting a rustling sound.

As the vengeful spirits emerged, the atmosphere around them grew thick with malevolent energy, and the Yin wind howled fiercely, making the air feel even more oppressive.

Just as Han Li was about to release the Jingyan Firebird to incinerate the spirits, he saw Ti Hu arrive.

Her nose twitched, and she let out a loud snort, releasing a burst of yellow light from her nostrils that enveloped the ghostly spirits emerging from Wu Chao's neck.

With a swift motion, she inhaled the yellow light, and the ghostly spirits within began to shatter and disintegrate, transforming into a dense black light that was sucked into her nostrils.

As the black light poured into her body, the dark energy surrounding them began to dissipate, and the night sky slowly cleared.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he felt a sense of relief. He held up his sword to protect Ti Hu, scanning the surroundings.

In the distance, the battlefield was still ablaze with intense fighting. The ancient temple was almost completely destroyed, with only a single arch remaining.

Of the original ten Red Robed Ghost Generals, only three remained: the scholar with the shrill voice and the Ox-Headed Ghost General.

On the side of the Tian Shui Sect, only Su Zhen and Jing Liu remained.

The corpses of the cultivators on the ground had disappeared, either devoured by the ghost generals or reclaimed by Jing Liu's Linglong Pagoda. The only ones left were the four scattered cultivators, now reduced to white bones, still maintaining their defensive stance, surrounded by a swarm of malevolent spirits.

Han Li hesitated for a moment before waving his hand, unleashing a gust of wind that scattered the nearby ghostly spirits. He then used the wind to sweep away the debris and bury the remains of the scattered cultivators.

The two combatants and the three ghost generals finally noticed the change in the atmosphere.

"Ghost King..."

The scholar ghost general let out a shrill cry, as if he had suddenly lost his mind, and charged towards Ti Hu.

Han Li swiftly intervened, his Qingzhu Fengyun sword slicing downwards.

A brilliant sword light, wrapped in golden lightning, tore through the dark sky, striking the scholar ghost general and splitting him in two.

The latter's body began to disintegrate, his voice whispering "Ghost King... Ghost King... Ghost..." as his form dissipated into nothingness.

The Ox-Headed Ghost General and the Horse-Faced Ghost General saw their companion fall and immediately fled, with Jing Liu and Su Zhen in hot pursuit, disappearing into the distance.

Han Li merely glanced at them before turning away.

He surveyed the surroundings, seeing that the situation had finally stabilized, and sat down cross-legged, closing his eyes to meditate.

The damage to his divine soul and the exhaustion from using the Time Law's power had left him feeling drained.

After a short period of time, his eyes slowly opened, and his expression turned complex.

The strange occurrences in the spirit realm and the appearance of the law's manifestation had left him perplexed. However, based on Qi Mochen's reaction, he suspected that this was not a coincidence, but rather a result of his cultivation of the Da Wuxing Huan Shi Jue.

Unfortunately, he had learned this technique through self-study, and some things could only be understood through trial and error.

With the True Word Treasure Wheel and other time law manifestations temporarily unusable, his options were limited, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration.

"This is a mixed blessing, I can only take things one step at a time..." he sighed, standing up.

Ti Hu, having finished devouring the entire Wu Chao, returned to her human form and approached him.

"Burp..." she let out a satisfied belch.

"I ate a bit too much..." Ti Hu said with a hint of embarrassment.

"Earlier, you said you felt a bit empty inside, now that you've eaten your fill, it's good. Let's head back to the cave and rest for a while..." Han Li smiled and said.

"I need to close my eyes and cultivate for a while, and then I'll be able to help Master even more." Ti Hu replied.

Han Li nodded, and with a wave of his hand, opened the silver light door. Ti Hu stepped through, disappearing into the distance.

Han Li watched her go, his eyes narrowing slightly as he pondered the events that had transpired.
