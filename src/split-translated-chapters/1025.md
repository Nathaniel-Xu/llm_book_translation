Dongfang Bai suddenly turned around and spat out a mouthful of air.

A large green banner flew out of his mouth, shook slightly, and suddenly countless green flowers appeared, forming a green flower cluster that rushed towards the incoming electric light.

A thick fragrance spread out, and the fragrance contained a special power that made people feel soft and weak, losing their strength.

The electric light was covered by the fragrance, and its sharp light weakened, striking the flower cluster.

The green flower cluster flashed wildly, and was broken by the attack, but still managed to block it.

At this time, Dongfang Bai's body became blurry and turned into a green shadow, shooting towards a tall golden palace below.

A loud thunderclap sounded, and Han Li suddenly appeared, rushing towards the palace.

At the same time, he pinched a seal.

The electric light suddenly intensified, and a burst of golden light exploded, tearing apart the remaining green flowers.

The green banner appeared, but it was already broken into two pieces, losing its spiritual energy and falling to the ground.

The electric light flew back and disappeared into Han Li's sleeve.

Han Li's figure appeared in front of the palace, just as he was about to enter.

Just then, a loud rumbling sound was heard.

The originally open palace door suddenly closed, and the door was several dozen feet high, with a black and shiny surface that exuded an unbreakable feeling.

Ancient golden patterns were engraved on the door, forming a sword shape, with some large and some small, emitting a fierce and sharp aura, indicating a powerful seal.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and he stopped in front of the door, not forcing his way in. He looked around and asked, "Tixi, have you finished investigating? What is this place?"

"Master, wait a moment, the memories in these four people's souls are very vast, and it will take some time... Ah, this is the transmission hall of the Jin Yuan Sect's domain, and inside is the cross-domain transmission array!" Tixi's hands glowed with black light, wrapping around the four people's souls, using her soul-searching technique. Her face suddenly changed, and she exclaimed, "You want to leave? Humph!"

Han Li heard this and clenched his fists.

His three giant heads suddenly became clear, one transforming into a mountain giant ape, one into a true spirit dragon, and one into a heavenly whale, his body suddenly growing larger, and his skin glowing with over 900 spiritual light points.

Three true spirit bloodline powers burst out of his body, and a powerful and terrifying aura exploded from him.

Han Li shouted, and his two fists struck the black door.

"No, master, this hall is made of the legendary material god stone, which is one of the hardest materials in the world, and even a Mahārāja might not be able to break it. Moreover, the seal on the door is very powerful, and it cannot be broken by brute force. I have already found the opening method, let me try..." Tixi saw Han Li's actions and immediately spoke up.

But before she finished speaking, Han Li's fists had already struck the door.

With a loud crash, the palace shook violently, and the surrounding area within a hundred miles was torn apart, with smoke and dust flying everywhere.

The nearby air was filled with a loud rumbling sound, and a fierce storm was stirred up.

The door shook violently, and a dense network of cracks appeared.

Suddenly, thousands of golden sword lights erupted from the door, forming a massive sword array that attacked Han Li.

The fierce sword intent filled the air, surpassing Han Li's Blue Bamboo Bee Cloud Sword Array.

Han Li spat out a mouthful of air, and a green light flew out, wrapping around the sword lights.

The green light flashed, and all the sword lights disappeared, as if the previous sword array was just an illusion.

The green light flew back into Han Li's mouth, and his six giant fists glowed with silver light, striking the door again.

With a loud crash, the door finally collapsed, shattering into countless fragments.

"What were you just saying?" Han Li suddenly remembered that Tixi had said something earlier, and he turned to ask her.

"Uh..." Tixi stared blankly at the destroyed door, muttering.

Han Li's eyebrows moved slightly, and he ignored Tixi, rushing into the palace.

The palace was circular, with a diameter of several hundred feet, and the floor was supported by dozens of giant white stone pillars.

In the center of the palace, a golden transmission array was set up, with a diameter of over 60 feet, and countless mysterious symbols were engraved on it.
The twelve silver pillars surrounding the golden array stood tall, each one several meters high, with a majestic silver dragon carving on top.

At this moment, Dongfang Bai was busy arranging the silver crystal stones around the golden array, inserting them into the grooves on the pillars.

Half of the pillars were already filled, and the silver light on the pillars grew brighter, with the silver dragon carvings spewing out silver light towards the center of the array.

Han Li's massive body crashed to the ground, creating two deep pits, and the entire hall shook violently.

"Impossible! There's a divine stone gate outside, and the Tianyi Sword Array is set up on it. How did you break through so quickly?" Dongfang Bai's face was filled with incredulity as he roared.

"Han Li, you shall die!" Dongfang Bai shouted.

Han Li ignored Dongfang Bai's question, his massive body emerging from the smoke, like a demon god from the chaos. The golden light on his body flashed, and the True Words Treasure Wheel appeared behind him.

Dongfang Bai's face changed, and he didn't bother to arrange the array anymore. His body flashed, and he disappeared from the spot.

Han Li smiled slightly, not paying attention, and activated the True Words Treasure Wheel.

A low hum sounded, and countless golden ripples spread out from the wheel, filling the entire hall.

The air near the door rippled, and Dongfang Bai reappeared, trapped by the True Words Treasure Wheel, unable to move.

Han Li's body flashed, and he returned to his human form. He flicked his finger, and a golden sword shot out, piercing Dongfang Bai's abdomen.

Dongfang Bai's abdomen was torn open, and his Yuan Ying was shattered, his true body destroyed.

Han Li's heart relaxed, and he changed his hand seal. The golden ripples from the True Words Treasure Wheel flashed once and disappeared.

As the ripples vanished, a green light ball shot out from Dongfang Bai's body, heading towards the outside of the hall.

"Ah, the soul!" Han Li said calmly.

A dark shadow flashed, and Ti Hou appeared, blocking the green light ball with a wave of his hand, unleashing a bloody light that wrapped around the ball.

The green light ball struggled fiercely, but it couldn't escape.

"Two friends, I was wrong in the past, and I offended you both. Please spare my life, and I'll give you all my collections and the wealth of the Golden Source Sect. The Golden Source Sect is a rich and prosperous realm, with countless resources and treasures. I won't disappoint you."

The green light ball revealed Dongfang Bai's face, speaking quickly.

Han Li smiled, not responding.

Ti Hou's eyes were filled with hatred as he looked at Dongfang Bai's soul.

"Han friend, I can convert to the ghost path, become a ghost servant, and serve you for life. With my current cultivation, I won't lose much strength. I can help you. Moreover, I know that the Nine Yuan Sect has sent experts to capture you. With my help, you can escape, but if you kill me, you'll soon fall into their hands."

Han Li's eyes moved slightly, hearing this.

"Master, this person is the main culprit behind Ye Su Su's death. We can't let him go! And with his soul in hand, we can search his memories." Ti Hou said urgently.

"Hmph! I have a secret technique to lock my soul, and your soul-searching technique won't work on me." Dongfang Bai sneered.

"Don't worry, master, my law is specifically designed to deal with souls. Ordinary people can't search his memories, but I can..." Ti Hou said quickly.

"Ti Hou, don't worry, I never intended to let him go. I came here today to avenge the Qing Huo clan. No matter what he says, I won't spare him. You can use the soul-searching technique, even if we don't find anything in his memories, it's fine." Han Li raised his hand, stopping Ti Hou's words.

"Thank you, master!" Ti Hou said, overjoyed.

As soon as he finished speaking, a dark light burst out from his palm, enveloping Dongfang Bai's soul.

Countless blood-red symbols jumped out from the dark light, penetrating Dongfang Bai's soul.

Dongfang Bai's mournful cry echoed from the dark light, but his soul didn't shatter.

Han Li's eyes lit up, pleased with Ti Hou's technique.

He walked to Dongfang Bai's corpse, taking a storage ring from his hand, and his divine sense entered the ring.

His face soon revealed a look of surprise, and he waved his hand.

The ground flashed, and a small pile of silver crystal stones appeared.

Han Li glanced at the half-arranged transmission array and pondered for a moment before picking up the crystal stones and continuing to insert them into the remaining pillars.

Although he didn't find any information about the transmission array in the storage ring, he was confident that Ti Hou would soon uncover the secrets.

It was better to prepare the transmission array first and wait for Ti Hou to gather the information before leaving.
