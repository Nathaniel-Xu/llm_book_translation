Before long, a man in a green robe appeared in the White-Haired Valley. It was none other than Han Li.

When he had heard the village elder mention the Spring of Luminous Eyes earlier, he had felt that it was not ordinary, and that the power of the Time Laws it contained had changed the villagers' physical bodies to some extent, causing them to appear youthful or withered.

If he were to cultivate the Great Five Elements Illusory Realm Technique here, he might be able to break through in a shorter amount of time, and his chances of dealing with the Heavenly Court's pursuers, such as Qi Mozi, would increase.

However, the Time Laws in the spring water seemed to be unstable, and according to the village elder, they would only appear once every hundred years, and the time would not be long. If Han Li wanted to utilize them, he would have to find the source of the Time Laws' power.

After entering the valley, Han Li did not immediately head to the depths of the valley, but instead examined the rugged and rocky terrain on both sides.

After a moment, he discovered something strange. Many of the rocks scattered about had golden characters and talismans engraved on them.

Some of the talismans were still intact, while others were broken and worn, but none of them had any remaining spiritual energy.

"No wonder I sensed a faint fluctuation of the Time Laws earlier, but couldn't feel it when I arrived at the White-Haired Valley. The concealment effect of these talismans is quite good, and even though they're broken, they still have an effect."

Han Li's eyes lit up as he stroked a talisman on a large rock. He suddenly had an idea - since the concealment effect was so strong, why not hide here?

For the past two years, Han Li had been running from the Heavenly Court and the Jiuyuan Sect, leaving behind fake trails and decoys to confuse his pursuers. However, he had never been able to truly shake them off.

With his mind made up, Han Li began to carefully examine the valley, occasionally stretching out his hand to mimic the talismans on the rocks.

By the time the sky turned white, he had finished his work and sat down on a large rock, exhausted.

After a night of work, Han Li had restored most of the broken talismans and moved the rocks to their original positions, restoring the valley's original appearance.

As the array was completed, a mist began to rise from the valley, covering the entire area in a layer of white fog.

Han Li flew into the air and examined the valley with his spiritual sense, discovering that even the faint fluctuation of the Time Laws he had sensed earlier had disappeared.

If even his own spiritual sense couldn't detect anything unusual, then it was likely that no one else could either.

Han Li descended back into the valley and headed towards the depths of the valley, where the Spring of Luminous Eyes was located.

As he entered the valley once more, he saw the two large rocks that formed a human-like shape, and his eyes narrowed as he noticed that the spring water was also shrouded in a layer of white mist.

The mist was condensed and did not dissipate, and Han Li's spiritual sense detected that it was not just ordinary mist.

He flew forward, his eyes fixed on the spring water, and saw several old men lying on the ground, their bodies withered and gray.

Their clothes were quickly decaying, and their bodies were revealing their skeletal remains.

"Looks like they weren't lucky this time..." Han Li sighed.

He reached out a hand and stirred the water, feeling a refreshing sensation, but nothing else.

Just as he was about to withdraw his hand, he sensed a faint flow of warm water emerging from the depths of the spring, enveloping his hand.

The water felt smoother than the surrounding water, and Han Li detected a fluctuation of the Time Laws.

His hand began to grow and shed hair rapidly, and he smiled, "It seems that the Time Laws can accelerate the flow of time. There must be something extraordinary hidden here."

He gathered the seven or eight skeletons and placed them at the edge of the pool, then stepped into the pool himself.
Han Li arrived at the spring's edge, bent down, and reached out with his hand to search around. After a moment, he moved the small stones aside, but all that was revealed was a small opening buried in the mud at the bottom of the pool, with nothing unusual about it.

"This doesn't seem right," Han Li said, his face full of doubt as he looked up at the two massive stones above. Upon closer inspection, he noticed that the two stones, which were arranged in a human-like shape, had a circular symbol carved into each side, but there was no spiritual energy emanating from them.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and a purple light flashed in his eyes. When he looked at the symbols again, he noticed a change.

 Inside the two circular symbols, a golden light seemed to be flowing, like two golden fish swimming in opposite directions. Han Li's heart stirred, and he rose into the air, placing his hands on the symbols.

His body began to glow with a soft, golden light as he activated the Five Elements Phantom World Technique. The golden light flowed from his hands, connecting with the symbols and causing them to rotate rapidly. The symbols' centers lit up, and a golden light burst forth, creating a golden screen that blocked the space between the two stones.

Han Li had already retreated to the outside of the stones, looking at the golden light screen that had appeared out of nowhere. He hesitated for a moment, then looked up at the sky, which was starting to brighten.

With a determined look, Han Li activated his protective aura and the True Extreme Membrane, and then flashed into the golden screen.

The screen vanished, and the pool returned to its calm state. After a while, the water began to seep into the ground, and the spring stopped flowing.

The pool eventually dried up, leaving behind only a few skeletons lying on the rocks. 

...

In the western part of the Golden Source Mountains, a lone mountain peak stood tall.

A red-haired man with large hands and feet, and strange markings on his skin, stood on the mountain peak. He was gazing into the distance, with flames erupting from his head.

This was Qimozi, who had been tracking Han Li.

"This is the 136th puppet," Qimozi said, looking at the shattered puppet at his feet. "He's left behind a blood essence, but also set up a blood seal. Once the puppet is destroyed, the blood essence will be burned, leaving no trace behind. How can he be so cunning?"

Qimozi turned to a young man standing behind him, who was none other than Xiongshan, the former vice sect leader of the Zhulong Sect.

"Sir, I've had personal experience with Han Li's cunning," Xiongshan said, his face clouding over. "I never thought he would grow so quickly, becoming a major threat to the Heavenly Court."

Qimozi's eyes narrowed. "I was thinking of capturing him quietly, but he dared to attack the Golden Source Sect and kill Dongfang Bai. Now, the Heavenly Court will surely take notice of him."

Qimozi's expression turned cold. "I no longer need to hide my tracks. I can openly pursue him in the name of the Heavenly Court."

Xiongshan hesitated. "Sir, judging from his trail, he seems to be heading towards the central region of the Golden Source Sect. However, the forces there are complex, and it may be difficult to pursue him..."

Qimozi snorted. "The Heavenly Court has been dissatisfied with the Golden Source Sect for some time. If any of the sects dare to intervene, it will be a perfect opportunity to teach them a lesson. But those sect leaders are cunning, and they will likely avoid getting involved."

Qimozi paused, then nodded. "You're right. Han Li usually acts alone, so he won't be hiding in any of the sects. We should focus on searching for areas where the sects' influences intersect or are weak."

Qimozi fell silent, then nodded in agreement with Xiongshan's suggestion.

"Let's go," Qimozi said, his eyes gleaming with determination. "I want to see how far he can run!"

With a wave of his hand, a fiery red flying shuttle appeared, and Qimozi and Xiongshan leapt into the air, disappearing into the distance.
