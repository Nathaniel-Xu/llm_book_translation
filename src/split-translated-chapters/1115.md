“Do you have any thoughts on this, Brother Han?” Fox Three didn't respond to Crocodile Three, but instead turned his gaze towards Han Li and asked indifferently.

“Releasing the Black Heaven Demon God is indeed a high-risk move, but if Brother Crocodile has a way to control it, then it might not be a bad idea to use it to resolve our current predicament.” Han Li replied without hesitation, but for some reason, a strange sense of anxiety arose in his heart.

He slightly shook his head and forced himself to calm down.

“I think it's not a good idea. According to Lei Yu's information, the Black Heaven Demon God's power far surpasses ours. If we recklessly release it, we can't control the consequences. In my opinion, it's better to focus on breaking the Five Elements Void Array first and then have a good talk with Dao Yin and the others. It's more stable that way.” Fox Three looked at Han Li with a hint of surprise, seemingly not expecting him to agree with Crocodile Three's proposal.

“Brother Liu, you need to have some faith in me. But since you insist, let's focus on breaking the Five Elements Void Array first. If the situation doesn't improve, we can use the second step and release the Black Heaven Demon God.” Crocodile Three frowned, his expression slightly displeased.

“Alright.” Fox Three nodded, compromising.

“Regardless of whether we're breaking the Five Elements Void Array or releasing the Black Heaven Demon God, we need to first break through the light barrier in front of us. That's not an easy task.” Han Li suddenly spoke up.

“Don't worry about that, Brother Han. When I obtained the Heavenly Earth Seal, I left a hidden hand in it. If I use my magic to activate it, I can disrupt the law of the seal for five breaths. The Five Elements Void Array is based on these five fourth-grade immortal artifacts, so if the Heavenly Earth Seal is disrupted, the five-colored light barrier will definitely have a weakness.” Crocodile Three's eyes flashed with a cunning light, and his weak voice resonated in Han Li and Fox Three's minds.

Han Li was taken aback, looking at the five immortal artifacts behind the light barrier.

These five artifacts were originally only fourth-grade, but he had previously seen their incredible power and thought they had already reached third-grade.

He secretly sighed, realizing that he had been cultivating alone for years, even after joining the Wheel of Rebirth Temple. Although his cultivation had improved, his knowledge and experience were limited compared to someone like Crocodile Three, who was nurtured by a large organization.

“Do you think there's a problem with what I just said, Brother Han?” Crocodile Three noticed Han Li's expression change and asked.

“None, let's not delay. We'll act now.” Han Li shook his head and said.

Crocodile Three nodded, and the two of them briefly discussed their strategy.

With a loud "Boom!", Han Li's Time Domain suddenly burst forth, enveloping the entire hall and covering everyone in its light.

Then, Han Li and the other two flew out, charging towards the altar from three different directions.

Although they had exchanged many words, it didn't take much time, only 1-2 breaths.

The five-colored disk in front of Dao Yin suddenly lit up as he pointed his finger, and Han Li and the others flew towards it.

The three of them's protective light auras clashed with the void, producing a deafening roar as they sped towards the five-colored light barrier.

“Hmph, you're overestimating yourselves!” Dao Yin looked at the scene and smiled, his eyes gleaming with mockery.

Han Li's Time Domain had enveloped him, but his actions didn't slow down, and the five-colored light barrier's spirit light fluctuations remained the same.

Han Li's eyes widened as he saw the light barrier's five-colored spirit light surge and then flash wildly.

A loud "Boom!" followed, and another wave of five-colored light balls shot out from the light barrier, heading straight for Han Li and the others.

Perhaps due to Dao Yin's hasty casting, the number of light balls was significantly fewer than before.

However, the light balls' speed didn't decrease until they had traveled a short distance, slowing down by more than ten times.

Han Li watched the scene, his eyes widening in surprise, and then he looked at the Years God Lamp beside Dao Yin, suddenly understanding.

It seemed that the Years God Lamp was affecting the surrounding area, blocking the effects of his Time Domain.

A thought flashed through his mind, and his eyes lit up, realizing that the Years God Lamp was more mysterious than he had anticipated. If he could obtain it, the time law contained within it would be invaluable, and he could refine countless time law crystals from it.

He estimated that he could refine at least a thousand crystals from it, based on his previous experience.

The thought of obtaining the Years God Lamp sparked a strong desire in his heart, but he quickly suppressed it, reminding himself that he couldn't afford to be distracted by this now.

However, his heart still felt a sense of restlessness, but he couldn't focus on it.

He faced the incoming five-colored light balls, his body not stopping or defending, but instead, he raised his hand and waved it.

The Huaguang sword array appeared in front of him, welcoming the light balls.

Crocodile Three and Fox Three, however, stopped and retreated, their initial attack having been a feint to draw Dao Yin's attention and prevent Han Li from bearing the brunt of the Five Elements Void Array's attack alone.
Moreover, those five-colored light balls, although fewer in number than before, were still not something they could withstand.

When Dao Yin saw the Tongtian Sword Diagram, his expression changed instantly, and he quickly made a series of hand seals.

The five-colored light screen flashed again, and the light balls flying towards Han Li immediately flew to the side, trying to avoid the Tongtian Sword Diagram.

Han Li felt a slight sense of relief in his heart, and as he had guessed, the Tongtian Sword Diagram was extremely important to the Tongtian Sword Sect. They were hesitant to destroy it.

As he thought about it, the golden light on his body flashed again, and his speed suddenly increased by several times, allowing him to instantly pass through the five-colored light balls and reach the five-colored light screen.

Han Li flipped his hand and put away the Tongtian Sword Diagram, then raised his hands and made a fierce gesture.

The over 200 Time Law crystals in his body flew out and gathered in front of him, and the golden light in the surrounding Time Domain also surged in wildly.

"Clang!"

A clear sound like the clash of gold and iron echoed through the air, and between Han Li's hands appeared a massive golden sword, 10 zhang long and half a zhang wide.

The sword's surface flashed with fiery golden light, and its golden hue flowed like a river, shining like a golden sun.

Then Han Li moved his arm, and the golden sword descended from above, its unstoppable momentum causing the air to distort and the surrounding space to seem to collapse.

Dao Yin saw the golden sword's power and his eyes narrowed, but then he sneered and made another hand seal.

The old man with the yellow face on the jade pillar quickly made a hand seal, and the Heavenly Earth Seal on his head flashed brightly, shooting out a thick yellow light that entered the five-colored light screen.

The light screen flashed again, and its thickness increased significantly.

At the same time, Jiao San, who had been flying backward, suddenly stopped and made a series of hand seals, and a dazzling dark red light appeared in his hands, flashing three times in quick succession.

The Heavenly Earth Seal on the yellow jade pillar's surface suddenly appeared a layer of dark red light, and the yellow light it emitted faded rapidly.

The old man with the yellow face was shocked, and then he quickly made hand seals, trying to activate the Heavenly Earth Seal, but it had no effect.

At this moment, the light on the five-colored light screen also dimmed, and the light screen near the yellow jade pillar became extremely thin, almost disappearing.

The five-colored light balls flying out suddenly shattered and dispersed, turning into points of spiritual light that vanished into thin air.

Before the old man with the yellow face and Dao Yin could react, Han Li's golden sword had already struck the thinnest part of the light screen.

"Rip!"

The light screen made a sound like tearing fabric, and Han Li's sword created a gap several zhang long.

Jiao San saw this and her face lit up with joy.

She quickly recited an incantation, and the dark red light on her body flashed wildly, and she also opened her spiritual domain, covering the entire great hall.

Then she twisted her body and turned into a dark red light, charging towards the gap in the light screen.

Almost at the same time, Huo San swung his hand and sent out the Heavenly Fox Blood Knife, and his body transformed into a gray-white light, attaching itself to the knife.

The Heavenly Fox Blood Knife let out a "whooshing" sound, transforming into a blood-red rainbow that shot towards the gap, faster than Jiao San.

Far away, Qi Mozi, Xiong Shan, and the Eagle-Nosed Demon King were watching Han Li's actions, and they all looked surprised.

"Big brother, those three have already broken through the great array's light screen. Now is the best time to break the Wuxing Yu Kong Great Array. Should we go forward and assist them?" The turtle-backed demon asked the Eagle-Nosed Demon King through a voice transmission.

"No need, let them fight each other to mutual defeat. Here, all the humans are untrustworthy. Now that they're holding back the great array, we can take advantage of the opportunity to find a way to leave this place." The Eagle-Nosed Demon King coldly gazed at Han Li and the others, then transmitted a response.

"But..." The turtle-backed demon's face showed hesitation.

"Big brother is right, this place is full of danger, and we should leave quickly. We shouldn't have listened to Qi Mozi's words and come here, which led to the death of Old Three and Old Four!" The white-boned demon said sorrowfully.

"Okay, let's quickly investigate the restrictions on the light screen and see if we can find a weakness." The turtle-backed demon said.

"You want to leave? You're not going anywhere, the three of you just stay here!" Just as the three demons were about to fly away, a cold voice sounded in their ears.

Before they could react, a solid golden spiritual domain descended, covering the three demons, and Qi Mozi's figure stood in the virtual space, a sneer on his face.

"Qi Mozi, what do you want to do?" The Eagle-Nosed Demon King shouted, his body surrounded by black energy, struggling fiercely.

Unfortunately, the three demons were covered by the golden spiritual domain, and their speed slowed down by more than ten times, and the surrounding golden spiritual domain was extremely solid, making their efforts ineffective.
