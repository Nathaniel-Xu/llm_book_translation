The Spatial Immortal Artifact? That's great, Brother Sun, please deploy it quickly, this noise is really unbearable," said the red-clad woman.

"Brother Sun, if you have any divine abilities, please assist us," said the black-robed youth, his face also filled with pain.

"Brother Sun's words seem to have left something unsaid, this immortal artifact is quite troublesome to activate," said the triangular-eyed man, his brow furrowing.

"Brother Lian's words are not wrong, this immortal artifact is a broken five-grade artifact, its restrictions are damaged, and it's difficult to activate, requiring the five of us to work together to deploy it, and it will consume a lot of our spiritual energy, I don't know if the four of you are willing to lend me a hand?" said the gray-robed elder.

"Consuming some spiritual energy is better than enduring this suffering," said the triangular-eyed man, a hint of greed flashing in his eyes before disappearing.

The red-clad woman and the black-robed youth also nodded in agreement, only the white-robed nun remained silent.

"Yu Xianzi, what's your intention?" asked the gray-robed elder, looking at the white-robed nun.

The white-robed nun's eyebrows furrowed, seemingly hesitant.

But the golden wind blades outside the flying boat grew denser, and the sounds transmitted inside grew louder, shaking her heart and making her almost breathless.

"Since Brother Sun's immortal artifact can let us avoid this noise, I'll naturally lend my strength," said the white-robed nun, her voice like a gentle stream, exceptionally melodious.

Han Li heard the white-robed nun's voice for the first time and his eyes lit up.

This voice was almost identical to Yu Menghan's.

With a similar face, name, and voice, it was unlikely to be a coincidence, and he was now 90% sure that this woman was Yu Menghan.

"Good, let's start quickly," said the gray-robed elder, delighted, and spat out a small, dark red three-legged cauldron.

The cauldron's design was ancient and simple, with half of its surface carved with simple patterns of flowers, birds, insects, and fish, and the other half inscribed with dense, glowing ancient characters.

Unfortunately, one of the cauldron's legs was broken, slightly ruining its overall aesthetic.

Han Li examined the cauldron and nodded slightly, it seemed to be an extraordinary treasure.

But just as he was about to speak, his body suddenly shook, and his eyes locked onto the ancient characters on the cauldron, his face revealing a strange expression, with a mix of surprise and excitement.

"Master, what's wrong?" asked Ti Hu, noticing Han Li's unusual behavior.

But Han Li didn't respond to Ti Hu's question, as if he hadn't heard it.

The gray-robed elder spat out a stream of golden light, which entered the cauldron, and simultaneously, his hands flew quickly, shooting out a barrage of magical seals that entered the cauldron.

The cauldron's mouth suddenly emitted a dark red glow, like a liquid spreading outward, but at a slow pace.

"Everyone, quickly lend me a hand, and use your spiritual energy to activate the cauldron!" shouted the gray-robed elder.

The red-clad woman and the others heard his words and raised their hands, each shooting out a stream of spiritual energy that entered the three-legged cauldron.

The cauldron violently shook, emitting a powerful suction force.

The five people's spiritual energy immediately surged out, and within a few breaths, 30% of it was absorbed.

Fortunately, the cauldron's suction force soon slowed down, and with a loud rumble, the dark red glow burst out, instantly filling the entire room and enveloping the five people.

Enveloped by the dark red glow, the outside noise disappeared, and the white-robed nun and the others' faces relaxed.

"Thank you, everyone..." said the gray-robed elder, turning to the other four with a smile.

But just as he spoke, a green shadow flashed before him, and a soft sound was heard, as a dark green snake-shaped sword pierced the gray-robed elder's abdomen.

A series of green glows erupted from the sword, wrapping around the elder's body.

The gray-robed elder's skin instantly turned green, and with a thud, he fell to the ground, his breath gone.

Then, a figure appeared, and the triangular-eyed man's shadowy form materialized beside the three-legged cauldron, his hand bursting out with a yellow glow that transformed into a large yellow hand, grasping the cauldron.

A series of rapid changes occurred, and the other three people only reacted after a moment.

"Li, what are you doing?" shouted the black-robed youth, his face filled with anger.

The white-robed nun and the red-clad woman were also shocked and angry, but didn't speak.

The triangular-eyed man coldly smiled, not responding to the three people, and with a wave of his hand, the yellow hand holding the cauldron began to retract.

But just as he did, the dark red glow that had filled the room suddenly collapsed, enveloping the five people's bodies, and then rapidly shot back into the cauldron.

Neither the white-robed nun and the others, nor the triangular-eyed man, had time to react, as they were all sucked into the cauldron, disappearing from sight.

The room was left with only the dark red cauldron floating in the air.
At this moment, the room's void fluctuated, and Han Li and Qi Hun's figures appeared.

Han Li's expression had returned to calmness, but he still stared at the ancient text on the small, dark red cauldron.

"This cauldron actually has the ability to capture and store, it seems it's not an ordinary spatial artifact. However, those people have all been captured inside the cauldron, what should we do now? Wait for them to come out?" Qi Hun also examined the small cauldron, then asked.

Han Li didn't speak, remaining silent for a moment before opening his mouth to spew out a cluster of cyan flames, enveloping the three-legged small cauldron and intensely burning it.

...

White-clothed nun and the others' vision blurred, and the next moment they appeared in a dark red space.

This space was quite large, approximately 20-30 li in size, with the ground and sky both presenting a dark red color, giving off an intense pressure. The air was filled with a chilling aura, making them feel uncomfortable.

The group appeared on a broad square in the center of the space, surrounded by nine dark red stone pillars, each several dozen zhang high. The pillars were engraved with complex array patterns, seemingly forming a large array.

Unfortunately, three of the stone pillars were broken, and the array patterns had also collapsed.

Nearby, a series of majestic buildings stood, almost filling the dark red space. However, most of the buildings had collapsed, with many large craters and massive fissures on the ground, indicating that a brutal battle had taken place here.

The four individuals were shocked by the sudden change, and momentarily forgot about their animosity, instead looking around cautiously.

At this moment, the gray-robed old man's corpse suddenly inflated, transforming into a blood-red, flesh-like tumor, roughly a zhang in size, with fresh blood and green spots scattered about, looking extremely terrifying.

The triangular-eyed man and the others saw this scene, their faces changing, and hastily retreated.

However, the blood-red tumor suddenly came to life, rolling and chasing after the triangular-eyed man, its speed surpassing his. In an instant, it closed the distance to within a dozen zhang.

The triangular-eyed man was shocked, and a green glow flashed on his body. He turned around and shot towards the left rear, his finger pointing.

A green light shot out from his sleeve, and the green snake sword flew out, transforming into a hundred-zhang-long green sword light, slashing towards the blood-red tumor.

Unexpectedly, the sword light hadn't reached the tumor when it suddenly exploded, releasing a massive blood-red energy wave mixed with fragments of flesh, sweeping across an area of several hundred zhang.

The triangular-eyed man's heart was filled with shock, and he spat out a cluster of black light, transforming into a flower-patterned, ancient black shield, blocking the front of his body.

The next moment, a loud explosion sounded, and the energy wave swept towards him, sending him flying several thousand zhang away, shield and all.

Although the black shield had blocked the energy wave, the contained power still sent the triangular-eyed man's blood surging.

As he was about to suppress his energy, a cold aura attacked him from behind, and the nine golden knives suddenly shot out, already mere inches from his back.

The golden knives were thin as a cicada's wing, with a strange, double-headed beast carving on the handle, emitting a piercingly cold aura.

The triangular-eyed man was shocked, and his shoulders shook. A green light screen shot out from his body, welcoming the nine golden knives, while he dodged to the side.

However, at this moment, the double-headed beast carving on the knife handle suddenly opened its mouth, releasing nine golden sound waves that enveloped the triangular-eyed man.

The triangular-eyed man's face contorted in pain, his body momentarily frozen.

At this moment, the nine golden knives' light suddenly expanded, intersecting with each other, forming a golden knife array that enveloped the green light screen. With a swift motion, it tore the screen apart, turning it into fragments.

The golden knife array then enveloped the triangular-eyed man, and with another swift motion, it sliced his body into seven or eight pieces, fresh blood splattering everywhere.

A green light shot out from the triangular-eyed man's remains, fleeing towards the distance, which was actually his nascent soul.

However, at this moment, a figure appeared out of thin air, extending a golden hand, and grasping the green nascent soul. It was the black-robed youth.

"Hah! Lian Yun, you dared to be arrogant towards me earlier, but now you've finally fallen into my hands! You'll be begging for mercy, but I'll make you suffer for a hundred years, trapped in the yin fire, unable to live or die!" The black-robed youth sneered, his face twisted in cruelty.

From afar, the white-clothed nun saw the black-robed youth's cruel expression, her brow furrowed, and a hint of disgust flashed in her eyes. However, she suppressed it, and together with the red-dressed young woman, flew towards him.

"Brother Tie, Lian Yun was greedy and despicable, stealing and killing Sun Brother. He deserved to die. However, this place is filled with strange energies, so let's first join forces to investigate." The white-clothed nun said.

"Agreed." The black-robed youth hastily composed himself, and stored away the green nascent soul and the nine golden knives.

He waved his hand, sending a golden light towards the triangular-eyed man's remains, aiming to retrieve his storage pouch and the green snake sword.

However, at this moment, the ground on the square suddenly emitted a dark red glow, and then vanished, taking the triangular-eyed man's remains and the green snake sword with it.

The black-robed youth's golden light grasped at nothing, and he was left stunned.

The white-clothed nun's face also changed, her eyes rapidly scanning the surroundings.

"Lian Yun indeed deserved to die, but there's no need to investigate this place. You two should just surrender." A voice suddenly echoed, and the void in front of them fluctuated, revealing a figure - the gray-robed old man, who smiled and said.
