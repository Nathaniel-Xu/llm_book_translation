Han Li took the jade bottle and opened it to find a ball of white light slowly rotating inside. With each rotation, the white light would flash and expand, as if it possessed life.

At the center of the light was a white pill. Countless specks of light flickered on its surface, looking extremely profound and emitting an overwhelming aura of life.

"What is this?" Han Li's eyes flashed.

The aura emitted by this pill was somewhat similar to the Crab Daoist's heart.

"This pill is called the Mysterious Truth Pill. I used the elemental essence energy and combined it with many other precious materials to refine it. Although this pill is not used to refine the True Soul, it contains a lot of 'Mysterious Truth Essence', which is enough for you to advance to the Great Luo stage in the future." The Crab Daoist said slowly.

Han Li was both surprised and delighted. He had seen the name "Mysterious Truth Essence" in ancient books many times. It was the key to advancing to the Great Luo realm.

To advance to the Great Luo realm, in addition to having sufficient cultivation and unblocking the 360 immortal cavities, the most important thing was to complete the transformation of the soul, turning it from an ordinary soul into a Great Luo True Soul.

To complete this transformation, the Mysterious Truth Essence was required.

The Mysterious Truth Essence was extremely precious. It was said that only by passing through the Nine Heavens' Wind and entering the extremely dangerous outer void could one find a trace of it in the purest place between heaven and earth. It was truly a divine object of the Mysterious Heaven.

Now, Han Li finally understood the reason why Shi Zhanfeng entered the Accumulated Scale Void. He guessed that it was also to obtain enough Mysterious Truth Essence for his future advancement to the Great Luo realm.

"Thank you, fellow Daoist Crab. This is indeed what I need." Han Li did not decline and accepted the jade bottle.

Seeing Han Li accept the bottle, a smile appeared on the Crab Daoist's face.

"Fellow Daoist Crab has given me such a treasure. I, Han, am not an ungrateful person. When my cultivation is sufficient in the future, I will definitely come back to help you." Han Li said solemnly.

"Then I will thank you in advance. This small Mysterious Truth Pill is far from enough to repay fellow Daoist Han's kindness. If there is anything I can do for you, please feel free to ask." The Crab Daoist said with a smile.

"Since fellow Daoist Crab said so, there is indeed one thing I would like to trouble you with." Han Li's heart stirred and he said.

"Oh, what is it? Please tell me." The Crab Daoist was slightly stunned, then immediately said.

"It's still about Ti Hui's matter. Fellow Daoist Crab, your divine power has greatly increased. I hope you can diagnose her." Han Li said.

More than a thousand years ago, the Crab Daoist had only taught him a sealing technique and could not let him examine Ti Hui carefully at that time.

"No problem." The Crab Daoist immediately nodded and then pointed his finger.

A golden light entered Han Li's body and turned into a golden ball of light in his dantian, constantly spinning.

As before, the pressure of the surrounding space immediately disappeared, and the spiritual energy in his body resumed circulation. He immediately opened the branch space.

The two of them entered the pavilion inside.

Ti Hui was lying on the bed, her body covered in black lines, forming a sealing formation that emitted waves of sealing aura.

This was the sealing technique that the Crab Daoist had taught him.

The Crab Daoist walked to Ti Hui's side and carefully examined her for a moment, his brows suddenly furrowing.

Seeing the Crab Daoist's expression, Han Li's heart couldn't help but tighten, and his face turned slightly gloomy.

The Crab Daoist raised his hand and pointed at the center of Ti Hui's eyebrows. The tip of his finger revealed a black crystal light that rippled outwards in circles.

Ti Hui's body trembled slightly, and her cultivation seemed to recover a bit, as if she was about to wake up.

Seeing this, Han Li was immediately overjoyed.

But in the next moment, Ti Hui's body resumed its silence and stopped moving.

The Crab Daoist's expression changed slightly. He flipped his hand and a beam of black light shot out from his palm, entering Ti Hui's forehead.

Ti Hui's body trembled again slightly, then immediately resumed its silence.

The Crab Daoist's face turned solemn. He slowly withdrew his hand and his brows were tightly locked.

"Fellow Daoist Crab, how is Ti Hui's condition?" Han Li asked uneasily.

"Ti Hui's condition is very peculiar. It seems that she has been injured by some kind of extremely powerful law force, causing her soul and vitality to continuously dissipate. I can only stabilize her condition, but to cure her, I am powerless." The Crab Daoist shook his head and said.

"With your cultivation as a Dao Ancestor, you can't cure Ti Hui. Who else can cure her?" Hearing this, Han Li's heart turned cold and he said slowly.

Although the Grand Priest of the Demon Race had not yet diagnosed Ti Hui, with the Crab Daoist's strength, he was still unable to do anything. It was feared that the Grand Priest's intervention would also be useless.

"You don't have to be so discouraged, Dao Ancestor. I am not omnipotent. The puppet laws I cultivate specialize in control and are not good at saving people. The mysteries of the countless laws in the world are far beyond your imagination. Although I can't save Ti Hui, someone else can." The Crab Daoist said with a light smile.

"Is that so? Who is this person?" Han Li was stunned for a moment, then immediately asked anxiously.

"It's the Grand Priest of the Sacrificial Temple that Shi Chuankong told you about before. This person cultivates laws that target the soul and has reached an extremely high level. He should be able to cure Ti Hui." The Crab Daoist said.

"I see. Thank you for your guidance, fellow Daoist Crab." Hearing this, Han Li's eyes lit up and he cupped his fists in gratitude.

Now that the Great Prince was dead, it would probably be much more troublesome to ask the Grand Priest to act. It might even develop into a direct conflict with the Night Sun Dynasty. But for Ti Hui's sake, he couldn't care about so much anymore.
"Senior Xie, when will you open the spatial passage?" Han Li's thoughts raced, and he quickly made up his mind to ask.

"Although I have now advanced to the Dao Ancestor realm, opening a spatial passage connecting to the outside still requires some preparation. Moreover, opening the spatial passage this time is not just for you alone. I have other arrangements, so let's wait until Sha Xin and the others arrive. It will be in about half a year." Xie Dao Ren pondered briefly before replying.

Han Li nodded slowly, naturally having no objections.

The two then left the flower branch space and returned outside.

Xie Dao Ren went to handle matters related to opening the spatial passage and soon took his leave. Han Li returned to his previous closed-door cultivation location.

After Xie Dao Ren left the main hall, he quickly arrived at a hidden secret room.

In the secret room, only a single oil lamp was lit, its dim light illuminating a small area while the rest remained pitch black.

At this moment, a hazy black figure stood beside the oil lamp with his hands behind his back.

Xie Dao Ren saw the black figure but showed no surprise on his face, as if he had expected this.

"Dao friend Shi, after many years of hard work, you have finally succeeded in one go. Congratulations." The black figure turned around, his face blurred and his body indistinct, as if not a physical entity but a projection.

"All thanks to your guidance back then. In my youth, after slaying two corpses, I rashly attempted to kill the third. But due to flaws in my state of mind, even if that villain E Wu hadn't lured the Shi Kong fish, that attempt to kill the corpse would have surely failed. Fortunately, at the critical moment, I received your guidance to seal my soul's memories into a puppet, transforming into a puppet to experience the puppet path in the lower realm. Now I have gone from puppet to human, finally comprehending the true meaning of the puppet laws and succeeding in one fell swoop." Xie Dao Ren bowed deeply to the hazy figure, expressing his gratitude.

"It was just a bit of cultivation experience. Dao friend Shi's ability to comprehend it is also due to your own extraordinary perception." The hazy figure said calmly.

"No matter what, I will never forget Senior Shi's great kindness." Xie Dao Ren said solemnly.

"I don't want to hear such empty words of thanks. I came this time to ask you if the agreement from back then still stands." The hazy figure said.

"Of course. Shi Kong Yu caused me such misery. If I don't properly repay him, it would be too easy on him." Xie Dao Ren sneered.

"Shi Kong Yu has controlled the demon domain for a long time and is very powerful, far beyond what you, a minor Ji Lin Kong realm cultivator, can handle. Moreover, although you have now attained the Dao Ancestor position, fighting alone is still far inferior to Shi Kong Yu. Don't be impatient. We will slowly plan for the long term." The hazy figure's eyes flashed with a hint of joy before advising.

"I understand. I won't make the same mistake twice. Senior, rest assured." Xie Dao Ren nodded and said.

"That's good. By the way, I came this time because there is something I need your help with." Hearing this, the hazy figure nodded slightly before speaking.

"Senior, please tell me." Xie Dao Ren was stunned for a moment before quickly responding.

The hazy figure walked over to Xie Dao Ren's side and moved his lips slightly.

Hearing this, Xie Dao Ren instinctively glanced in one direction, his expression changing slightly.

...

Han Li's closed-door cultivation location.

The golden sphere of energy in his dantian was much fuller than before, still spinning rapidly without dissipating.

Han Li sat cross-legged and circulated his immortal spiritual power, causing a burst of golden light to emanate from his body.

Since entering the Ji Lin Kong realm, he had not operated his immortal spiritual power so smoothly for over a thousand years. At this moment, he felt extremely comfortable.

The power of the time laws that had been dormant in Han Li's body for many years was finally no longer restrained and surged wildly inside him like a tidal wave.

A buzzing sound rang out as a golden wheel appeared behind him, spinning rapidly. It was the Zhen Yan treasure wheel.

Then, a flash of light appeared on the other side of his body, revealing the Guang Yin bottle. With successive flashes of light, the Fantasy Chen hourglass, the Broken Time fire, and the East Yi divine wood all emerged, revolving around his body on their own.

Han Li frowned. The Zhen Yan treasure wheel and other items had now appeared automatically, not triggered by him.

"Could it be happening again..." he thought, startled, muttering to himself.

At this moment, threads of time law crystals flew out from these objects, converging into a golden ring that spun rapidly.

All the time law power in Han Li's body swarmed out and merged into the golden ring.

The golden ring quickly expanded, doubling in size in the blink of an eye. It emitted dazzling golden light and trembled violently, producing a sharp buzzing sound.

With a whoosh, a green light flew out from his chest. The green light then shrank and transformed into a dark green small bottle, which was the Palm Heaven bottle.

The bottle's body burst with light, like a green sun, while simultaneously emitting a powerful attractive force.

Another whoosh rang out.

The golden ring shot towards the bottle, rapidly shrinking until it was the same size as the bottle's mouth before directly fusing with it.

Upon contact, a vast amount of time law power rippled out from the Palm Heaven bottle.

The bottle then quickly expanded as countless green symbols appeared within it, transforming into a mass of green clouds that churned endlessly.

Immediately after, green light flashed from the bottle's mouth as a thick green beam shot out and disappeared into the void in front of it.
