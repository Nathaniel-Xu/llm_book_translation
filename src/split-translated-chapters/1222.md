Chu Zhong's heart skipped a beat as he saw Han Li's body enveloped in a white glow, which seemed to be burning with an intense energy that made him feel like he couldn't muster the courage to fight back.

In a daze, he felt as though the person charging towards him wasn't a human cultivator, but a powerful ancient beast.

Chu Zhong took a deep breath, steadied himself, and formed a hand seal with his fingers. He then made a pulling motion with his hands, and the air around him seemed to ripple and distort.

The "丑" character platform shook with a series of sharp, piercing sounds, and the air on either side of him seemed to condense into a dark, swirling vortex that caused the space around him to collapse inwards.

Under the influence of the gravity law, the space on the platform had become severely distorted, and Han Li felt as though he was being pressed down by an invisible force. He also felt a powerful, unseen barrier in front of him, and a crushing pressure on his body.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he began to circulate his "天煞镇狱功" technique. His body's acupoints glowed brightly, and the starlight surrounding him seemed to shrink and condense into a sharp, sword-like shape that pierced downwards.

There was a loud, cracking sound as the dark energy vortex split open, and Han Li's figure disappeared into the void.

The sound of thunder echoed through the air, and the space around Chu Zhong returned to normal.

The crowd looked on, and saw Chu Zhong standing still, his hands still in the shape of a pulling motion, while Han Li hung suspended in mid-air above him, his fingers pointing at Chu Zhong's forehead.

"I...I lost," Chu Zhong said, defeated.

"Chu Daoist, I apologize," Han Li said, as he flipped himself over and landed on his feet, bowing to Chu Zhong.

The crowd cheered, and their attention turned to the other platforms.

"Ha! Zhao Shanzhu, my junior brother is really full of surprises!" Zhou Xianyang said, looking at Zhao Yuanlai with a smile.

"If he wins one more round, your sect will receive a Bodhi token, a rare honor indeed. Let's see if he can pull it off," Zhao Yuanlai said with a hint of jealousy.

As they spoke, the elder in charge announced the winner of the match, and Han Li and Chu Zhong exchanged bows before leaving the platform.

This time, Han Li didn't return to the Xianyang pavilion immediately, but instead went to the circular stone platform to watch the other matches.

His battle with Chu Zhong had taught him that in a fight where he could only use his Xianyang identity, he needed to be more aware of his opponent's laws and techniques in order to gain the upper hand.

Now that the next round had begun, Han Li saw that the "亥" character platform was empty, with only a mess of debris remaining. It seemed that the fight had ended earlier than expected, and the winner was none other than the peak master of the solitary Yang peak, Si Kongjian.

The other platforms were also nearing the end of their matches, with rainbow-colored lights flashing and thunderous sounds echoing through the air.

Among the participants, Han Li was particularly impressed by Luo Yuanshan of the Qinghui forest, Wen Changtian of the Gertian gate, and Zi Luoxianzi of the Tianyou lake. Wen Changtian had the highest cultivation level, and was clearly at the mid-stage of the Daluo period. If he could overcome the bottleneck, he would become a mid-stage Daluo cultivator. Zi Luoxianzi's laws were the most unusual, and were based on the purple crystal law, which had a mesmerizing effect. Luo Yuanshan, on the other hand, was a human cultivator with a blue birthmark on his face, and what caught Han Li's attention was his ruthlessness in battle.

As the last match came to an end, Han Li left the area and returned to the Xianyang pavilion.

The next day, Han Li followed the Xianyang sect members to the arena.

Today was the final day of the competition, and the crowd was even larger than before. On the high platform, besides the five people, there was an additional person - Chi Meng.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat when he saw her. He had just fought a fierce battle with her not long ago, and she was incredibly strong and cunning. Today, he had to be on his guard and not let her see any weaknesses.

Han Li closed his eyes and slowly regulated his breathing.

Before long, the elder in charge announced the start of the third round, and the participants were invited to come forward and draw lots.

Han Li opened his eyes and stood up.

"Junior brother, this final round is all up to you," Zhou Xianyang said, looking at Han Li seriously.

If he won this round, he would receive a Bodhi token.

"Don't worry, senior brother," Han Li said with a slight smile, seeming to have complete confidence in himself.
Zhou Xianyang's expression calmed down upon seeing Han Li's demeanor.

Han Li stood up, subtly glancing around the surroundings.

The competition had already gone through two rounds, and it was almost time to reveal the results. Han Li wondered what Wu Yang, Jiao San, and the others were doing, and what the Wheel of Rebirth would do next.

Han Li transmitted a message to Ti Hu, warning him to be cautious and not to underestimate the situation. Then, Han Li and the other twenty-three people stepped onto the stage again.

"Alright, please begin selecting your numbers," the host elder said, nodding slightly at Han Li and the others before tossing the objects into the air.

Twenty-four orbs emitting brilliant light flew into the air and landed on the heads of Han Li and the others.

Everyone raised their hands to catch the orbs, each grabbing one.

Han Li also caught an orb, which had the number eight written on it.

A soft laugh came from the side, and it was Si Kong Jian, who had an orb with the number seventeen written on it. He smiled as he looked over at Han Li.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed slightly, but he quickly relaxed.

"This is terrible, it's actually Si Kong Jian!" Zhou Xianyang thought to himself, his heart sinking.

Although he knew Han Li's true cultivation level had reached the Great Luo Realm, Han Li had to mimic the fighting style of Chang Qi, hiding his true identity and unable to fully utilize his strength.

Si Kong Jian, on the other hand, was a highly experienced Great Luo cultivator, renowned for his achievements. He had easily won the previous two rounds, and his strength seemed to have improved even further.

Han Li, with so many concerns, was now facing Si Kong Jian. Could he win?

The other people from Xian Shan Zong didn't know Han Li's true strength, and their faces turned even more unsightly upon seeing the situation.

"Ha ha, it seems that Brother Chang's luck has run out, and he's actually facing Si Kong Jian in this final round. However, with Brother Chang's incredible strength, Si Kong Jian shouldn't be a problem, right?" Zhao Yuanlai said with a mocking smile.

Zhou Xianyang coldly snorted, not saying a word.

At this moment, only twenty-four people remained, and the stage was divided into twelve arenas for simultaneous matches.

Han Li and Si Kong Jian's match would take place on the "Un" arena.

"Hehe, this Si Kong Jian, as the peak master of Gu Yang Peak, is actually participating in the competition himself. His face is quite thick, isn't it?" Tian Xing Zun said with a chuckle from the high platform.

"This competition doesn't have any rules against sect leaders participating, so we cultivators should be practical and focus on gaining benefits. Only those with short-sighted vision would give up on the current benefits for the sake of appearances." Huo Yuan coldly said.

Xian Shan Zong, Gu Yang Peak, and other sects maintained their independence on the surface, but in reality, they had already established connections with the Tian Yue Alliance and the Bai Zao Mountain.

In the current chaotic state of the Da Jin Yuan Xian Domain, it was difficult to survive without a strong backing.

Xian Shan Zong had a good relationship with the Tian Yue Alliance, which was planning to annex Xian Shan Zong. Gu Yang Peak, on the other hand, was close to the Bai Zao Mountain, and Tian Xing Zun and Huo Yuan naturally didn't get along.

"Please, both of you, calm down. According to the rules, there is no restriction on sect leaders participating in the competition. However, I think Xian Shan Zong's Chang Qi has extraordinary strength, and it's not certain that he will lose to Si Kong Jian." Chun Jun said, trying to mediate.

"Ah, according to Chun Jun's opinion, who do you think will win between Chang Qi and Si Kong Jian?" Lü Chuanfeng, the palace master of the Jin Yuan Xian Palace, asked with a smile.

Chun Jun looked at Lü Chuanfeng and silently cursed him for his cunning smile. This competition seemed to be a battle between Chang Qi and Si Kong Jian, but in reality, it involved the struggle for power among the major factions of the Tian Yue Alliance. If handled poorly, it would offend one or both of the factions.

"These two individuals have incredible strength, making it difficult to predict the outcome. Moreover, Palace Master Lü's 'Yu Xū Shén Mù' is a divine ability that can see through the smallest details. If we're discussing insight, only Feng Tian Xian Shi and Chi Meng can compare to you, Palace Master Lü. This question should be asked to you instead." Chun Jun said with a laugh.

Feng Tian Xian Shi's face lit up with a hint of pride upon hearing the praise.

"Ha ha, the 'Yu Xū Shén Mù' is nothing to brag about. Chun Jun's 'San Cai Wang Qi Technique' is far more exquisite and not inferior to my 'Yu Xū Shén Mù' in any way. We all want to hear your wise words, Chun Jun. Why are you being modest?" Lü Chuanfeng smiled.

Chun Jun shook his head, laughing, and turned to ask Feng Tian Xian Shi, "What do you think, Feng Tian Xian Shi?"

"These two individuals have remarkable strength, and the others are not weak either. Compared to the cultivators trained by the Tian Court, they are not much inferior." Feng Tian Xian Shi said, scanning the twenty-four people on the stage and avoiding the main topic.

Feng Tian Xian Shi's praise was excessive, and Chun Jun chuckled, saying, "The Tian Court is the ruler of the myriad realms, and we, the cultivators of the Jin Yuan Xian Domain, cannot compare to the Tian Court's elite warriors."

"Although the Tian Court's warriors are exceptional, the Jin Yuan Xian Domain has abundant resources and is not inferior to the Tian Court in many ways. It's only natural that we can cultivate such talented individuals. However, it would be better if they were willing to serve the Tian Court sincerely." Chi Meng said calmly.

The atmosphere on the stage changed, and the others looked at each other with a hint of unease.

Feng Tian Xian Shi's eyebrows furrowed, and he glanced at Chun Jun with a hint of suspicion.

"Chi Meng, what are you saying? We have always followed the Tian Court's lead, and if there are any orders, we will obey without hesitation." Chun Jun hastily said, trying to correct the situation.

The others also expressed their loyalty, saying they would follow the Tian Court's commands.

"Hehe, I was just joking, everyone. Please, don't take it seriously." Chi Meng covered her mouth, laughing.

The others laughed as well, and the atmosphere on the stage returned to normal.
