It should be said that these Dao soldiers can borrow the power from the Five Elements Altar to strengthen themselves. Han Li said so.

Just as he was speaking, the dazzling golden light had retreated, and the five-colored Dao soldiers surrounding them had also begun to charge towards Han Li and the others, wielding their weapons.

Among them, the two Dao soldiers with water and wood attributes charged towards the group of demons led by Qi Mozi.

Han Li's pupils constricted slightly as he saw this.

These Dao soldiers seemed to be in disarray as they charged, but in reality, they were still based on the previous formation, making some adjustments, and their mutual attack and defense were perfectly coordinated, with no flaws to be found.

Lei Yu and the others also noticed this, and their expressions turned serious as they activated their magical techniques and formed a defensive stance to prepare for battle.

"The rest is up to you guys."

Qi Mozi spoke as he suddenly leapt forward, crossing over the demons, and with a wave of his sleeves, a golden light rolled out, and he actively charged towards the fire-attribute Dao soldiers.

As soon as he made his move, he summoned a golden flame torch to hover in front of him, seemingly wanting to use the power of time to immobilize the Dao soldiers.

However, he soon discovered that his time-based magical technique had no effect on these Dao soldiers.

On the other hand, Xiong Shan, who was following closely behind him, was affected by the flame torch's radiance and was frozen in place, unable to move.

"Hmph, so that's how it is." Qi Mozi's eyes scanned the golden lanterns on the altar, and he suddenly understood.

These Dao soldiers could borrow the power of the altar, and naturally, they could also borrow the power of the divine lanterns to resist the effects of time-based magical techniques.

Qi Mozi immediately retracted the golden flame torch and took out the black stone axe, swinging it horizontally towards the incoming fire-attribute Dao soldiers.

A loud "whooshing" sound erupted as the axe blade extended, sweeping across the fire-attribute Dao soldiers in a half-moon shape.

The fire-attribute Dao soldiers seemed to know the consequences and immediately halted their charge, quickly changing their formation. The flames on their armor's surface connected, forming a single entity, and the frontmost Dao soldiers simultaneously swung their knives.

A loud "boom" echoed as the air in front of the fire-attribute Dao soldiers trembled, and a massive wall of flames erupted, advancing towards Qi Mozi like a raging tide.

The flames burned through the air, creating a series of space whirlpools.

Almost immediately, a second wave of flames formed, followed by a third, and so on.

As the black axe shadow fell on the first wave of flames, over a dozen space whirlpools had already appeared.

The two forces collided, producing a deafening roar, and the first wave of flames shattered, while the axe shadow exploded, but still maintained its momentum, striking the second and third waves of flames.

The remaining flames and the exploded axe shadow were all consumed by the space whirlpools, leaving no trace.

However, before the sounds of the collision had completely dissipated, Qi Mozi's black stone axe had already become a black whirlwind, enveloping him, and he had broken through the multiple waves of flames, directly charging into the midst of the fire-attribute Dao soldiers.

On the other side, Bai Gu and Tong Shi, along with the other four demons, looked at the incoming wood-attribute Dao soldiers and involuntarily focused their attention on the Eagle Nose Demon.

"How to form the array, Second Brother, you arrange it," the Eagle Nose Demon said slowly, his arms crossed. "Just remember not to break the formation too early, let them scout ahead first."

He seemed to have no intention of taking action himself, instead letting the other four demons work together to defend against the enemy.

"Don't worry, Big Brother, I'll take care of it," Bai Gu said.

The other demons seemed to have already grown accustomed to this and didn't think it was a problem.

"Brothers, it's been a long time since we've exercised our muscles. Today, let's use the Four Symbols Affinity Array to counter them," Bai Gu said, his eyes flashing with a fierce smile.

"Good!"

"Time to warm up!"

Tong Shi and the others responded in unison.

As soon as they finished speaking, the four demons charged forward, their bodies enveloped in rolling black smoke, and their auras of ferocity surged, increasing by a hundredfold in an instant.
In the black smoke, four ferocious beasts could be vaguely seen, with electricity flashing and thunder rumbling within, and flames flickering faintly.

Among them, the copper lion was in the lead, with the White Bone Pavilion behind, and the other two demons standing on either side. It was clear that they had formed a certain unspoken understanding, and although their attacks seemed independent, they were actually like one body.

The wood-attribute cultivators, who had rushed forward, were not afraid, with a burst of green light on their bodies, and their weapons suddenly falling to the ground, causing the earth to tremble violently.

The eagle-nosed demon's eyebrows furrowed, looking down, and saw a layer of green light spreading across the ground, and a layer of slippery green moss had grown, with roots and vines sprouting vigorously beneath it, suddenly breaking through the earth.

With a loud "boom", the ground beneath the demons' feet suddenly cracked open, and countless green vines burst out from the ground, piercing the Four Symbols Attached Array, causing the black smoke to surge and rumble.

"This is interesting, let's play together."

The eagle-nosed demon muttered to himself, stretching out his arms to both sides, and a layer of black flames suddenly appeared on his body. He then leapt up like a proud eagle, and plunged into the array.

At the same time, the battle between the other cultivators and the demons erupted.

The Blue Yuan siblings and the cultivators with flowing golden liquid on their bodies clashed, with the two of them flashing blue light, and their spiritual energy seemingly combined through some secret technique.

As they swung their four arms, a continuous flow of water burst forth from their bodies, constantly resisting the flowing golden liquid, and a white mist rose from the midst, releasing a bewildering fragrance that shook the soul.

At the same time, Lei Yu and Wen Zhong and Su Shengzi joined forces to deal with the stone giants, and the two sides were evenly matched.

The stone cultivators did not have any strange divine abilities, but their bodies were extremely sturdy and powerful, and under the support of their formation, they were even more formidable. Every time they were defeated, they could recover in a short time, like having a life of their own, making them very difficult to deal with.

Han Li, on the other hand, was currently working together with Jiao San and Huo San to deal with the cultivators holding golden spears.

These cultivators' armor was just as sturdy as the stone cultivators, and their spears were even more strange. Every time they stabbed out, the spiral golden light at the tip would shoot out like arrows, and the golden light was extremely sharp, able to tear through the void. Han Li, even though he kept a distance of tens of meters from the cultivators, the golden light they shot out could still pierce through to his vital points in an instant, making it difficult for him to defend against.

Moreover, these cultivators seemed to have little spiritual intelligence, but they were actually well-coordinated, like a well-disciplined army. Every time they attacked, they would have a follow-up move, forcing Han Li and the others to be on guard.

Just as Han Li suddenly shouted "Be careful!", Huo San was shocked, and his body suddenly twisted, barely avoiding the two golden spears that had transformed into a large sheet of golden light. However, he did not expect that above his head, another cultivator had jumped up, and stabbed downwards with his spear.

The spearhead's golden light flashed, and a large sheet of golden light rolled down, Huo San's body twisted to avoid it, but his shoulder was still pierced, and blood flowed out.

He glanced at the wound, and saw that it was not serious, so he continued to fight with the cultivators.

However, after a while, he discovered that his shoulder wound had not healed, and his entire arm had become heavy, as if filled with lead.

He was shocked, and quickly called out to Han Li and Jiao San, and took out a few medicinal pills, closed his eyes to meditate, but after a moment, he was shocked to discover that even after taking the medicinal pills, his wound was still bleeding non-stop.

Han Li saw this, and his heart moved slightly, his palm flipped, and he took out a yellow gourd, pouring out a yellow cloud that swirled and released a few yellow beans that rolled out, falling to the ground, and transforming into a few lightning cultivators, charging forward to fight with the golden-armored cultivators.

Han Li's cultivators were far inferior to the golden-armored cultivators in terms of level, but they had the advantage of numbers, and with Jiao San's cooperation, they could temporarily hold off the golden-armored cultivators' attacks.

"Fox Three, do not worry," Han Li said, as he flashed to Huo San's side.

"These cultivators' golden light is strange, a small wound is bleeding non-stop, and my arm is heavy, almost unable to lift it. Even the Clear Spirit Dan and other medicinal pills are ineffective." Huo San's brow was furrowed, and he said.

Han Li heard this, and his brow furrowed, his palm lifted, and a golden light appeared on his palm, gently touching Huo San's wound.

As the golden light flashed, the wound began to glow, and a small tree shadow appeared, with a dense time law fluctuation, and it was Han Li's Dong Yi Divine Tree.

The tree's shadow roots delved into Huo San's wound, and its branches swayed, stirring up layers of golden ripples, and a scorching sensation spread from the wound.

Huo San saw this, and exclaimed, "Ah!", and was shocked to discover that his arm was no longer as heavy as before, and the blood flow from the wound had stopped.

"Time is pressing, I have temporarily sealed the wound with time force, but later you will need to find another way to dispel this power." Han Li said quickly.

"This is enough, thank you." Huo San nodded, and thanked him.
