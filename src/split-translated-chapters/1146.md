Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he took a deep breath before slapping the bottom of the gourd. The gourd responded with a loud rumble, and a green light swirled around the opening, forming a vortex that shot out a dark green beam of light.

The beam struck the Nine Dragon Divine Fire Shield, causing a massive explosion that released a cloud of dark green mist. The shield trembled violently, its surface inscriptions glowing bright red, but it remained unscathed.

To Han Li's dismay, the five red crystal dragons on top of the shield suddenly came to life, their eyes flashing with golden light as they opened their mouths and spewed forth a stream of sticky, oily flames that engulfed the entire shield.

Han Li was immediately engulfed in the flames, and a wave of intense pain washed over him, forcing him to cry out in agony. His body, strong as it was, couldn't withstand the heat.

The Flame Bird, sensing Han Li's distress, flew out on its own and transformed into a layer of flames that surrounded Han Li's body, protecting him from the intense heat.

Despite this, Han Li still felt like he was being roasted alive. The Flame Bird, while protecting Han Li, also condensed its energy into a massive bird's head that shot out silver flames to counter the falling flames.

The two flames clashed, creating a fiery vortex above Han Li's head. Han Li's anxiety grew as he realized that the Flame Bird was not absorbing the flames as it usually did, but instead was using its own flames to resist the attack.

He quickly connected with the Flame Bird's mind, learning that the flames possessed a unique fire attribute law that made it impossible for the Flame Bird to absorb. Instead, the Flame Bird was being suppressed by the flames.

As Han Li's concern grew, the Nine Dragon Divine Fire Shield's inscriptions flared up once more, and the remaining four crystal dragons descended, surrounding Han Li from all sides and unleashing a torrent of flames that engulfed him.

The Flame Bird let out a fierce cry, its silver light flashing as it abandoned its resistance to the flames above and focused all its energy on protecting Han Li.

However, the combined might of the nine dragons was too great, and the Flame Bird's powers were slowly being drained away. Han Li's heart sank as he realized that the shield was also absorbing the Flame Bird's energy.

The Flame Bird and the nine dragons clashed, with Han Li using his Thirty-six Bamboo Bees Cloud Swords to attack the shield. The swords flashed with lightning, striking the shield with incredible force, but it remained unbroken.

As time passed, the Flame Bird's silver flames began to dwindle, while the Nine Dragon Divine Fire Shield's power grew stronger. Han Li felt his body being slowly incinerated, his soul on the verge of being consumed by the flames.

Just as all hope seemed lost, the Flame Bird suddenly spat out a white fire bead that hovered above Han Li's head, releasing a brilliant white light that infused the Flame Bird's silver flames with newfound strength.

The silver flames surged upward, repelling the red flames and creating a temporary reprieve for Han Li. He recognized the white fire bead as the fire attribute treasure he had obtained in the Tower of Time, which he had thought was already absorbed by the Flame Bird.

However, his relief was short-lived, as the red flames began to press in once more, and the nine crystal dragons closed in on the white fire bead, their jaws open wide as if to devour it.

The white fire bead's light began to falter, and the flames within the shield contracted, forming a red fire cocoon that engulfed Han Li. The temperature inside the cocoon was so intense that Han Li's skin began to crack and dry out, as if it was about to shatter at any moment.

The Flame Bird, seeing its master's distress, released a burst of colorful flames, with the red and orange flames separating and merging with the white fire bead. The bead's light surged, and it transformed into a white fire cocoon that shielded Han Li from the nine dragons' flames.
Han Li slightly caught his breath, seeing the refined flame bird sacrifice two clusters of seven-colored dan sand fire, its aura greatly diminished, and feeling guilty and regretful in his heart. His mind was in turmoil, but he didn't know how to break through the current predicament.

Just then, a voice filled with anger suddenly came from his chest:

"Are you stupid, can't you even run away when you can't win? You're wasting the ultimate divine art of traversing time and space, it's infuriating me..."

"Who's talking?" Han Li's heart skipped a beat.

The voice just now seemed both far and near, somewhat unclear, but he vaguely felt a sense of familiarity.

After a moment of thought, Han Li's face revealed a look of sudden realization, and he hastily reached into his chest and pulled out the Palm Heaven Bottle.

He looked at it, and the small bottle seemed unchanged, with no abnormalities.

However, at this moment, the bottle's surface suddenly flashed a dark green light, and two black eye beads the size of beans appeared, looking at him with a very human-like expression.

Han Li subconsciously pulled the bottle away, but when he saw the two black eye beads staring at him with anger, he quickly brought it back to his chest.

"Bottle Spirit, was it you who just spoke?" Han Li hastily asked.

"Who else could it be? A great Luo cultivator and a mere fourth-grade immortal artifact, and you're being forced to this extent, it's truly shameful." The bottle spirit's two eye beads moved, and a somewhat unclear voice came out.

"Just now, you said I could use the divine art to escape, this junior isn't unaware of it, but if I were to use my physical body to escape, wouldn't the Palm Heaven Bottle be left behind, falling into someone else's hands?" Han Li opened his mouth, but didn't know how to refute, and could only say.

"Is your life more important, or is the Palm Heaven Bottle more important?" the bottle spirit asked.

"My life is important, but the Palm Heaven Bottle has been with me for many years, it's equally important, and I absolutely cannot abandon it. Moreover, even if I were to temporarily escape with my physical body, I would still have to return here, and I wouldn't be able to escape in the end." Han Li didn't hesitate, and immediately replied.

The bottle spirit heard these words, and after a moment of silence, seemed to be very pleased with Han Li's words, and said:

"Very well, with your words, I won't regret appearing to save you this time. In the past, when you used your physical body to traverse time and space, the Palm Heaven Bottle would be in a state of no master, and would stay in the original location, as a coordinate for your return. But I can make the Palm Heaven Bottle traverse time and space with you, and the time experienced during the traversal will synchronize with the outside world. However, without a coordinate, you won't be able to return to the original location afterwards."

"Is it possible, please hurry and cast the spell." Han Li heard these words and was overjoyed, and immediately said.

"Don't be in a hurry to rejoice, this method can be used, but the cost is not small. Just to bring the small bottle into the River of Time, it requires the consumption of thirty time law crystals. Remember... it's consumption, and once used, it will be gone." the bottle spirit said.

The acquisition of time crystals was extremely difficult, and this time, thirty crystals would be consumed at once, and unlike the time dao patterns that could be restored, anyone who had to make this decision would find it hard to bear.

However, Han Li looked at the refined flame bird, which was still struggling to resist the nine dragon's attacks, and didn't hesitate, and immediately said:

"Please teach me, senior."

"There's nothing to teach, you just need to summon the crystal wall, and the rest will be taken care of by me." the bottle spirit said.

Han Li nodded, and immediately used his hands to seal the incantation, activating the Great Five Elements Fantasy World Technique. A layer of time law power fluctuations suddenly appeared around him, and five time law objects materialized, floating in mid-air.

As the surfaces of these objects flashed with dao pattern lights, the time crystals wrapped around them absorbed the time law power from the surroundings, condensing into a massive golden ring, which was the Time Ring.

As soon as the Time Ring appeared, a group of time dao patterns flew out from the True Speech Treasure Wheel and other objects, landing on the golden ring.

A series of extremely powerful time law fluctuations suddenly emanated from it.

The Myriad Law Immortal and the Red Dream, who were engaged in a fierce battle in the sky, sensed the fluctuations coming from below, and immediately realized that something was amiss. They stopped their fight and flew down towards the ground.

From a distance, they saw a cluster of dark green light suddenly appear within the nine dragon's divine fire, shining like a green sun, and radiating a dazzling green light.

The surrounding void began to violently shake, and a series of strange, visible ripples appeared, as a massive light vortex emerged from the void.

A giant crystal wall then materialized in front of Han Li, who stood in front of it, recalling the refined flame bird into his body, and enduring the intense heat of the divine fire. He turned around and saw the Myriad Law Immortal and the Red Dream rapidly approaching, and with a flash of his body, he directly plunged into the vortex on the crystal wall.

The Myriad Law Immortal and the Red Dream watched as the vortex swirled, and Han Li was swallowed up by it.
