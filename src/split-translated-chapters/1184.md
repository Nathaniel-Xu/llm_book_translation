Han Li felt a sudden sense of unease and his heart skipped a beat.

He immediately activated his Cultivation Technique, and a sharp pain shot through his mind as he suddenly came to. His body trembled slightly, and he quickly regained his composure.

He wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and glanced around, noticing that no one seemed to have noticed his unusual behavior. He also realized that he was the only one who had fallen into this state.

The surrounding barbarian tribespeople's gazes swept past the second gate, but they didn't linger for long.

Han Li collected his thoughts and was about to take another look at the third gate when his movements suddenly froze.

"How can this be? A sudden breakthrough...!" His eyes lit up, and his heart was filled with wonder.

In that instant, a faint, popping sound echoed within his body, and a hidden acupoint suddenly opened without warning.

"It's incredible! This person is indeed different from the others... Just by looking at it for a moment, they can break through to a new level!" Bai Ze's gaze wasn't on Han Li, but he sensed the changes within him and murmured to himself.

"Could it be...?"

Han Li's mind was filled with speculation, and he unconsciously looked at the second gate again.

However, when he gazed at the second gate this time, he didn't enter that mysterious state again. Instead, his true spirit blood vessels seemed to be stirred up, filled with a strong desire for the gate.

Han Li felt a pang of disappointment, but he didn't dwell on it. He looked at the gate for a moment before shifting his gaze to the last gate, the copper gate.

This gate was even more rugged than the first two, with no signs of artificial craftsmanship. Instead, it was covered in dense, crater-like depressions, like the surface of a meteorite-battered terrain.

Han Li looked at it for a moment, but didn't see anything special, so he slowly withdrew his gaze.

"The three gates you see before you lead to the actual, true Barbarian Sacred Temple. The stone temple on the Eight Wastes Mountain is just a place we built to store the Barbarian Sacred Flame." Bai Ze's voice suddenly echoed through the space.

"Are there three Barbarian Sacred Temples?" Liu Qing asked in surprise.

Although he was the leader of the Tian Huo tribe, he didn't know much about the Barbarian Sacred Temple.

"There is only one Barbarian Sacred Temple. The three gates lead to different levels of the temple's void space. The first gate is the foundation of the Barbarian Eight Kings' bloodline inheritance. You five can enter through this gate to inherit the bloodlines of the five True Spirit Kings." Bai Ze's gaze fell on the first gate as he spoke.

"Yes." Liu Yue and the others replied in unison.

As soon as they finished speaking, Qing Tian couldn't wait any longer and rushed forward, charging into the golden flames.

"Ah...!" His figure had just disappeared into the flames when a blood-curdling scream echoed through the air.

The crowd gasped in shock, and they saw Qing Tian's body being engulfed by the flames, his skin cracking open with fiery red fissures, looking like a porcelain vase on the verge of shattering.

"The Barbarian Sacred Flame can help you burn away the impurities in your body. You must endure it to inherit the bloodline power." Bai Ze said calmly.

As soon as he finished speaking, a deafening roar echoed through the air.

"Roar...!"

Qing Tian's body suddenly expanded, transforming into a giant, white-faced, red-handed ape with sharp horns and fangs. He charged towards the copper gate, and with a flash of golden light, he disappeared into the gate.

The young master of the Zhu Wu tribe saw this and smiled, his eyes gleaming with excitement. He leapt forward, entering the flames as well.

Liu Yue and Yuan Shanbai followed suit, jumping into the flames.

Xiao Bai was the last one, stepping into the flames with a calm expression.

As the flames roared to life, the group's true forms emerged, and they charged into the copper gate, disappearing from sight.

The square fell silent once again.

"You can all cultivate here in the square. Although the blood and flesh aura here is not as strong as the Barbarian Sacred Temple, it's still a great benefit for you. Take advantage of this opportunity and cherish it." Bai Ze said.

The crowd nodded and sat down, beginning their cultivation.

"Your Majesty, since the first gate is the foundation of the bloodline inheritance, can we enter the other two gates to cultivate? It's likely to be more effective than cultivating here." The leader of the Bai Bei tribe suddenly asked.

As soon as he spoke, the others turned to look at him, and even those who didn't dare to hope before now felt a spark of desire.

"They are the chosen ones of the bloodline, with the True Spirit Kings' bloodline protecting them. That's why they can enter the gates. What makes you think you can? If you're not afraid of death, you can try to open the gates and see if you can succeed." Bai Ze replied indifferently.

"I...I was too bold, I don't dare to be presumptuous..." The leader of the Bai Bei tribe trembled, shrinking back as he spoke.
Here is the translated text:

"Alright, you all stay here and cultivate, when the five of them inherit the bloodline and return, I will reopen the Shura Blood Gate and take you out." Bai Ze said without looking at him.

"Yes, sir!" everyone replied in unison.

Just then, a discordant voice rang out: "Your Majesty, I want to try..."

As soon as the words were spoken, everyone was shocked, and they all turned to look at the speaker, who was none other than the most detested person, Han Li.

"You're a fool, getting too big for your britches..." Qing Yuan tribe's leader was furious, scolding loudly.

The rest of the tribespeople also began to curse and scold, even Huo San and Li Qi Ma shook their heads, thinking that Han Li was being too reckless.

"I don't know my own limits, I want to try entering the second gate, I don't know if Your Majesty will allow it?" Han Li ignored the others and bowed his fist again.

"You have done us a great favor in the Savage Wilderness, wanting to try is not a problem. But I must warn you, this gate is not ordinary, the Savage Wilderness has countless true spirit types, and the eight of us becoming true spirit kings is not unrelated to the space behind this gate." Bai Ze's eyebrows furrowed as he spoke.

The second gate was actually the training grounds of the eight true spirit kings from back then?

"It's not easy to enter this gate, with just the mountain giant ape's bloodline in your body, and your human physique, you may not be able to withstand the Savage Wilderness flames, do you really want to try?" Bai Ze asked again.

This time, not only did the others become thoroughly shocked, but even Han Li himself began to doubt, could he really enter the place where the eight true spirit kings had achieved their greatness?

"I want to try, please grant me permission, Your Majesty." Han Li quickly made up his mind and said.

He dared to take this risk because of his own bloodline, which gave him some confidence, and also because he wanted to quickly increase his strength, which was crucial for rescuing Jintong later.

"Since you've made up your mind, then go ahead." Bai Ze hesitated for a moment before saying.

"Thank you." Han Li bowed his fist.

"If any of you feel that you can also pass through the Savage Wilderness flames and enter this gate, you can try, but you must take responsibility for the consequences. Alright, you all focus on your cultivation." Bai Ze said, and then his figure flew past, directly passing through the Shura Blood Gate and leaving.

The crowd saw this and looked at each other in dismay, before focusing their attention on Han Li.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he lightly spat out a mouthful of turbid air, his toes tapping the ground as he suddenly darted into the Savage Wilderness flames.

"Whoosh!"

A large wave of golden flames erupted, engulfing Han Li entirely.

He had originally wanted to rush straight to the second gate, but as soon as he entered the flames, his body was surrounded by a fierce burning pain, and he was wrapped in flames, being pulled downwards.

He struggled to move forward, but felt like he was being pressed down by a mountain, and his body was unable to move.

At the same time, his blood was boiling under the flames, and his meridians were wildly surging, every time they reached his heart, they pounded like a drum, making a loud " boom boom" sound.

This sound was not only heard by Han Li himself, but also by the others outside.

He was constantly calling out in his heart, trying to summon the Essence Flame Bird to protect himself, but the bird seemed to be restricted, unable to come out.

"This kid is really asking for death, the king has already said that without a strong true spirit king's bloodline to protect him, it's hard to withstand the Savage Wilderness flames, and he still wants to try..." Qing Yuan tribe's leader said with a smile.

"Heh heh, I've always disliked him, it's best if he dies here..." Tong Bi tribe's leader chimed in.

Anyone not of their tribe must have a different heart, since he was looking for death, then it's best if he dies.

Most of the Savage Wilderness tribespeople had similar thoughts.

Li Qi Ma didn't speak, he just glanced at Han Li and closed his eyes, beginning to absorb the powerful blood and flesh energy from the surrounding void.

"Brother Han, you're really too reckless... the Savage Wilderness' ancient blood is not something that a human physique can withstand." Huo San sighed.

Han Li was unaware of the others' reactions, at this moment his ears were ringing nonstop, his body was charred and blackened, and his skin was sizzling, looking like it was about to be cooked.

Just then, his body made a "boom boom" sound, like beans popping.

A colorful glow erupted from his body, and a giant ape's virtual image appeared, followed by the silver-winged Lei Peng, the True Dragon, the Heavenly Phoenix, the Dark Turtle, and the Soaring Snake, ten true spirit virtual images emerged one after another, surrounding him.

A wave of ancient and powerful energy spread out from the flames.

"Look quickly!"

"This... what's going on..." someone exclaimed.
