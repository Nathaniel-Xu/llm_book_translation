Time flew by, and it had been over a decade since then.

In the vast expanse of the Da Jin Yuan Immortal Realm, the city of Jin Ge stood tall.

Jin Ge City was located in the northwest of the Da Jin Yuan Immortal Realm, and was one of the few major cities in the realm, alongside the Nine Yuan Sect's Nine Yuan City, the Bao Zao Mountain's Bao Zao City, and the Jin Yuan Immortal Palace's Jin Yuan City.

Unlike the other three major cities, which were clearly under the control of powerful forces, Jin Ge City was a relatively free place, with no single force dominating it.

The city was home to numerous small and medium-sized forces that refused to be oppressed by the Nine Yuan Sect, the Bao Zao Mountain, and the Jin Yuan Immortal Palace. These forces had formed an alliance, known as the Ri Yue Alliance.

Although the Ri Yue Alliance's top-tier fighting force was not on par with the Nine Yuan Sect and the Jin Yuan Immortal Palace, it had immense potential. The alliance was particularly kind to small and medium-sized forces, as well as lone cultivators, attracting more and more of them to join its ranks.

Inside the city, in a luxurious wine loft with nine floors, three people sat quietly drinking wine in a private room. One of them was Han Li.

The other two were a black-clad young woman and a white-robed young man, who were actually Ti Hou and Xiao Bai in disguise.

Han Li had emerged from his secluded cultivation earlier than expected, and had come to the Da Jin Yuan Immortal Realm to attend to some matters. He had made significant progress in his cultivation, and his confidence had grown.

Just as Han Li was about to make his move, Ti Hou finally awoke from her slumber, and had successfully advanced to the Da Luo realm. This news filled Han Li with joy.

"I didn't expect to find a place like this in the Da Jin Yuan Immortal Realm, where we can temporarily relax without being bothered by the Nine Yuan Sect or the Jin Yuan Immortal Palace," Xiao Bai said, holding up a cup of green wine and taking a large gulp.

"Don't be too careless, though," Han Li cautioned. "Although Jin Ge City is under the control of the Ri Yue Alliance, we don't know if the Nine Yuan Sect or the Jin Yuan Immortal Palace have any hidden agents here. We should still be cautious."

"With Ti Hou here, we don't have to worry about anything," Xiao Bai said with a smile. "She can sense the malicious intentions of our enemies, and no one can hide their true intentions from her."

Han Li glanced at Ti Hou, and a hint of a smile appeared on his face.

Ti Hou's advancement to the Da Luo realm had not only increased her strength, but also her ability to sense the emotions of others. She could now detect the malicious intentions of her enemies, making her an invaluable asset to the group.

Han Li had personally tested her abilities, and even with his own strong spiritual sense, he couldn't hide his intentions from Ti Hou.

However, if he were to use his Time Law to protect himself, he could potentially conceal his true intentions from Ti Hou. But anyone who used such a method to approach Han Li would be immediately suspicious, and wouldn't need to be sensed by Ti Hou.

"I cultivate the Laws of the Soul, so my senses are naturally more acute in this regard," Ti Hou said. "But don't rely too heavily on my abilities. Other cultivators who have mastered the Laws of the Soul have methods to conceal their soul fluctuations, and may be able to evade my detection."

"Really?" Xiao Bai asked, surprised.

"Cultivators who have mastered the Laws of the Soul are extremely rare, and we're unlikely to encounter them," Han Li said with a smile. "But if we do, Ti Hou should be able to sense them. At that time, we'll need to be even more cautious. With Ti Hou by our side, our safety is guaranteed."

Ti Hou shot Han Li and Xiao Bai a glance, but a hint of a smile played on her lips.

"I'll be more careful and investigate our surroundings," she said.

Han Li smiled, and his gaze drifted out the window.

He had been in Jin Ge City for some time, and had been trying to gather information about the Nine Yuan Sect and Jin Tong through various channels. However, the Da Jin Yuan Immortal Realm was currently in a state of turmoil, and the Nine Yuan Sect had withdrawn its forces, making it difficult for Han Li to gather any information.

"Don't worry, Master," Xiao Bai said. "There's still a long time before the Bodhi Feast, and our Young Master should be safe for now."

Han Li nodded, and his gaze returned to the window.

Just then, a loud bell tolled in the distance, and the sound echoed throughout the city.

Han Li's eyes lit up, and he looked in the direction of the sound. His gaze fell upon a large commercial building in the distance, which occupied several miles of street space.

The building was made of a sky-blue material, and was adorned with countless star-like lights. It was extremely grand and majestic.

On either side of the building's entrance stood a pair of jade-carved qilin, accompanied by a row of guards wearing sky-blue vests. The guards were all Body Refiners, and their strength was impressive, with over a hundred opened meridians.

The guards' vests were adorned with hidden treasures, and the building's entrance was flanked by a large sign that read "Ri Yue Pavilion" in bold, dragon-like script. The sign exuded an aura of power and authority, and it was clear that the person who had written it was extremely powerful.

As Han Li watched, a series of lights flew towards the building from the sky, and a group of cultivators appeared at the entrance. They walked into the building, and Han Li's eyes followed them.

The Ri Yue Pavilion was a place of great interest, and Han Li's curiosity was piqued. He decided to investigate further, and perhaps find some clues about the Nine Yuan Sect and Jin Tong.
These cultivators were all extraordinary, with many existing in the Taiyi realm, and their faces all showed excitement as they discussed the matter.

"This is the once-in-a-thousand-years Grand Treasure Festival, and I heard that the auction at the Day Moon Pavilion will feature many rare and precious items that are hard to come by."

"The Day Moon Pavilion has been getting more and more prosperous, and I heard that they plan to compete with the Hundred Forge Mountain during this Grand Treasure Festival, so they must have prepared many treasures. Our family's resources are limited, so we can't participate, but it's still good to take a look."

"I brought all of my family's assets with me this time, hoping to buy 1-2 Advancement Pills to break through my current realm."

"I plan to buy a suitable magical artifact, so I can go to the Wilderness Domain and hunt down fierce beasts!"

From afar, on the top floor of the wine shop, Han Li also stood up.

"The auction is about to begin, let's go."

Xiao Bai heard this and immediately jumped up, his face showing some excitement.

"Xiao Bai, although you're using the Wheel of Reincarnation mask to conceal your aura, you still possess the true spirit bloodline of the Mo Eye Pixiu, and the Wheel of Reincarnation mask may not be able to conceal it completely. The auction is crowded, so it's best if you don't reveal your face." Han Li suddenly said to Xiao Bai, and then didn't wait for a response, waving his hand to release a stream of golden light that enveloped Xiao Bai, and then put him into the Flower Petal Space.

"Let's go." After doing this, Han Li said to Qiuhun, and then walked towards the stairs.

"Yes." Qiuhun smiled and followed him.

Han Li came to the Golden City this time not only to investigate the news of the Jiu Yuan Guan, but also for this auction.

The Hundred Forge Mountain, as the top-tier artifact refinement sect of the True Immortal realm, would hold a grand celebration every thousand years, which would be a joint event with all the branches of the Great Golden Source Immortal Domain. It was usually done through an auction, and the people of the Great Golden Source Immortal Domain called it the Grand Treasure Festival.

The other merchant guilds of the Great Golden Source Immortal Domain would also take advantage of this opportunity to hold their own auctions, competing for attention and profits.

The Day Moon Alliance, as a powerful alliance that was not inferior to the Hundred Forge Mountain, also operated a large merchant guild, and naturally would not remain idle.

In recent years, as the Day Moon Alliance's power grew, the competition with the Hundred Forge Mountain during the Grand Treasure Festival became more intense.

The Great Golden Source Immortal Domain, as one of the three immortal domains of the True Immortal realm, had top-tier sects like the Jiu Yuan Guan and the Hundred Forge Mountain, and was especially known for the Hundred Forge Mountain's artifact refinement. Therefore, countless precious materials flowed into the Great Golden Source Immortal Domain from all the large and small immortal domains.

So, every time the Grand Treasure Festival was held, the goods that appeared were the rarest of the rare.

Han Li had just left the Eight Wastes Mountain, worrying about how he could find the last Time Law artifact to balance the "Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique", and it was only when he learned about the Grand Treasure Festival from the Wheel of Reincarnation that he felt relieved.

He had originally planned to spare no expense to buy the last Time Law artifact at the Grand Treasure Festival, but unexpectedly obtained the treasure from Jiao San.

However, Han Li still had high expectations for the Grand Treasure Festival.

After all, he would soon be going to the Jiu Yuan Guan, and before that, he needed to increase his strength as much as possible.

Moreover, it wasn't just him, Qiuhun had also advanced to the Mahayana realm, and didn't have a suitable magical artifact, so it would be best to take advantage of this opportunity to acquire one or two.

However, the Hundred Forge Mountain and the Jiu Yuan Guan had a close relationship with the Heavenly Court, so Han Li definitely wouldn't dare to go to the Hundred Forge Mountain's headquarters, which was why he came to the Golden City, where the auction was being held.

Han Li and Qiuhun entered the Day Moon Pavilion, and to avoid drawing attention, they both suppressed their cultivation to the late stage of the Taiyi realm.

"Welcome, two seniors, to our Day Moon Pavilion's auction. I am Lan Mei, a disciple of the Day Moon Pavilion's executive, and I will guide you." A beautiful girl with blue hair and a blue dress immediately came to greet them, her cultivation reaching the late stage of the Golden Immortal realm.

"Lead the way." Han Li said calmly.

"Two seniors are both peak existences of the Taiyi realm, and have the qualifications to enter the VIP area. Please follow me." Lan Mei said, leading the way.

"This time, what kind of treasures will appear at the Day Moon Pavilion's auction? Is there a list? I'd like to plan ahead and allocate my immortal stones accordingly." Han Li asked as they walked.

"Please take a look, two seniors." Lan Mei took out two blue jade slips and handed them to Han Li and Qiuhun.

"Auction houses usually keep the list of auctioned items secret to pique the customers' curiosity and use the mystery to make a profit. The Day Moon Pavilion's auction is different, and they're willing to inform the customers in advance." Han Li's face showed a hint of surprise as he took the jade slip, and he lightly smiled.

His previous question was just a casual remark, but he didn't expect to actually receive the list.

"These are the rules set by our Day Moon Alliance's leader, who said that doing business values honesty and doesn't require pretending to be mysterious. Our Day Moon Alliance has developed to this point thanks to our honesty. This list is a gift to every guest who comes to the Day Moon Pavilion." Lan Mei spoke of the Day Moon Alliance's leader with a hint of admiration, and lightly smiled.
