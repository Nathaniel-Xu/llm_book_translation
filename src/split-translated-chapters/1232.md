Han Li didn't know much about the situation at the Nine Yuan Observatory, and couldn't think of a suitable reason, so he asked, "Lan, do you have any good excuses?"

Lan smiled slightly and said, "If the guards at the Golden Jade Gate were anyone else, I wouldn't have a way to get in. But since it's the Golden Thread Guards, I have a plan that might work."

Han Li's eyes lit up as he heard this, and he began to discuss the plan with Lan through voice transmission.

"Although it's still a bit risky, it's worth a try," Han Li said after a moment.

Just then, Ti Hu suddenly spoke up, "Master, even if you can deceive the guards and get into the inner observatory, the enemy's attack hasn't reached here yet. If you go in alone and get discovered, it'll be a desperate situation. Isn't that too reckless?"

Han Li's expression turned thoughtful as he replied, "Given the current situation, I think there won't be many powerful cultivators inside the observatory. It's a rare opportunity. However, your concerns are valid, so I'll contact the Cycle Hall to..."

But before he could finish, his movements suddenly stopped, and a faint smile appeared on his lips before quickly disappearing.

"Master?" Ti Hu sensed that Han Li had stopped moving and asked in confusion.

"It's nothing, there's no need to contact the Cycle Hall," Han Li said.

Ti Hu found Han Li's decision strange, but didn't say anything.

"Lan, come out," Han Li said, waving his hand. Lan's figure appeared beside him, but she was wearing a blue cloak that covered her body and face.

"Let's go," Han Li said, and the two of them flew towards the Golden Jade Gate.

As they approached the gate, a large, golden-armored man emerged from the light screen, his face stern as he shouted, "Who dares to intrude on the Golden Jade Gate?"

This man was over a zhang tall, with muscles that seemed to be knotted like steel wires, and a thick, black beard that bristled like steel needles. He looked extremely powerful, and his cultivation had reached the early stage of the Great Luo Realm.

"Qi Elder, it's me," Lan said, lowering her cloak to reveal her face.

"Ah, Lan, what brings you here?" the golden-armored man asked, his expression changing from stern to surprised.

"Qi Elder, please open the Golden Jade Gate. I have important news to report to the sect," Lan said, her expression serious.

"Now that the enemy has invaded the Nine Yuan Observatory, the three gates are closed, and no one is allowed to enter or exit without a special permit. Do you have a permit, Lan?" Qi Elder asked.

"I was sent by the Miao Fa Saint to investigate the enemy's situation, and due to the urgency of the matter, the Saint did not give me a permit. However, the information I've gathered is extremely important, so I hope Qi Elder can help me," Lan said, producing a pale green token from her hand.

"Ah, the Miao Fa Saint's token!" Qi Elder's expression changed as he saw the token, and he revealed a respectful expression.

The four Great Saints in the Nine Yuan Observatory held extremely high positions, second only to the Observatory Master and Deputy Master. They were far above ordinary elders like Qi Elder.

As for Lan's words, Qi Elder didn't doubt them. He and Lan had known each other since before they joined the Nine Yuan Observatory, and they had maintained a relationship over the years. Qi Elder knew that Lan had been transferred out of the Dark Guard and was now directly under the Miao Fa Saint's command, so it was reasonable that she would be investigating the enemy's situation.

"However, I am responsible for guarding the Golden Jade Gate, and the rules are clear. I'm afraid I must refuse your request, Lan," Qi Elder said, hesitating for a moment before shaking his head.

"Qi Elder, the information I've gathered is extremely important, and it concerns the enemy's goals. If I can report it to the sect, there will definitely be a great reward. However, my position is lowly, and this information needs to be reported to the Miao Fa Saint, who will then report it to the sect. Qi Elder, you've always wanted to enter the Council of Elders, and if you help me today, I can ask the Miao Fa Saint to put in a good word for you with the Observatory Master. Entering the Council of Elders will be easy," Lan said, taking two steps forward and transmitting her voice to Qi Elder.

The Golden Jade Gate's restrictions were extremely powerful, but they didn't block sound.

"Is this true?" Qi Elder asked, his heart racing with excitement.

"Qi Elder, we've known each other for a long time, and you should know that I'm not a person who breaks promises. If you help me today, I'll definitely remember your kindness," Lan replied through voice transmission.

Qi Elder nodded slightly, but his expression still showed some hesitation. After a moment, he said, "Very well, please ask the Miao Fa Saint to explain the situation and give a direct order to open the gate."

"I've been trying to contact her since we started, but she hasn't responded yet. Maybe she's busy with something," Lan said, producing a blue transmission array disk from her hand. The disk's blue light flashed in circles, but there was no response.

Qi Elder's expression turned serious as he saw this, and he fell silent.

"Qi Elder, the two Deputy Masters and the other Saints are also sending people to investigate the enemy's situation. Maybe they'll discover this information soon, and the opportunity for merit will be lost. Don't let it slip away," Lan said, her expression urgent.

Qi Elder's body shook slightly as he heard this, and his lips moved twice before he fell silent.

Just then, the blue light on Lan's transmission array disk suddenly jumped, and a green-robed girl's figure appeared. It was the Miao Fa Saint.

"Connected!" Lan exclaimed, her face filled with joy.
The earlier Qi Changlao also revealed a joyful expression.

"Lan Yan, what matter do you have to report to me? I'm busy with something here, so be brief," said Miao Fa Xian Zun in a cold voice.

"Yes, Holy Envoy, I've been investigating those thieves according to your instructions. I've luckily discovered an important piece of information that requires a face-to-face report. However, the Jinyu Pass is currently closed. Please, Holy Envoy, issue a decree to allow Qi Changlao to let me in," Lan Yan quickly said.

"Ah, since it's an important matter that requires a personal report, Qi Changlao, you can open the Jinyu Pass. I'll explain the situation to the Guanzhu," Miao Fa Xian Zun said, looking at Qi Changlao behind the restriction.

"Yes, understood," Qi Changlao hastily replied.

Miao Fa Xian Zun's figure flashed, and she disappeared from the formation.

Han Li's eyes flickered with a hint of a smile, and he immediately hid himself.

At this moment, inside the Huazhi space, Ti Huan Jue closed the transmission formation in front of her.

She was currently disguised as a beautiful, slightly pale green-clad girl, which was Miao Fa Xian Zun's appearance.

"I hope our master is having a smooth time outside," Ti Huan Jue said, nodding to herself.

"The master's preparations are thorough, and the timing is just right. Qi Changlao is also blinded by his desires, and he won't suspect that Miao Fa Xian Zun is an imposter. You can rest assured," said a small white figure beside her.

"I hope so," Ti Huan Jue slowly nodded.

In front of the Jinyu Pass.

"Alright, now that the Holy Envoy has given the order, Qi Changlao, please lift the restriction," Lan Yan said, putting away the transmission array disk and loudly announcing it, seemingly intentionally letting others hear.

Qi Changlao secretly felt grateful to Lan Yan for giving him a legitimate excuse to step down, avoiding criticism from his subordinates.

"Since the Holy Envoy has given the order, I will follow it. Wait, who is this person?" Qi Changlao asked, looking at Han Li beside him.

Han Li was currently emitting a weak aura, and he hadn't noticed him earlier.

"He's called Zhou Yu, a disciple of our sect. I was just discussing the information I discovered with him, and it's related to him. He's a witness, so I need to bring him before the Holy Envoy," Lan Yan explained.

"Disciple Zhou Yu, greetings, Qi Changlao," Han Li said, looking slightly fearful as he bowed to Qi Changlao and took out his identity token.

The token had the image and name of his master, and he had already transformed into Zhou Yu's appearance. He wasn't afraid of being exposed.

However, he hadn't seen Zhou Yu in person, so he couldn't absorb his aura to create a better disguise.

Qi Changlao examined Han Li for a moment, then took out a golden jade gui and pointed it at Han Li's token.

A golden light shot out, piercing the restriction and entering Han Li's token.

Han Li's token suddenly radiated a golden glow, and a figure appeared inside, identical to Han Li's current appearance.

Qi Changlao carefully compared the two, then used his divine sense to investigate Han Li's body. Finding nothing unusual, he nodded and put away the jade gui and his divine sense.

Han Li secretly let out a sigh of relief and put away his token.

"Open the restriction," Qi Changlao ordered.

Eight cultivators in golden robes flew out from the back of the crowd, each taking out a golden flag that was several feet tall. They activated their magic, and the flags unfolded, making a rustling sound as they released a dazzling golden glow.

The glow formed a series of golden waves, each composed of countless tiny golden symbols. As the cultivators continued to cast their magic, the waves converged, forming a golden sphere the size of a human head.

Qi Changlao waved his hand, and a golden light shot out from his body, taking the form of a golden token.

He activated the token, and its surface glowed with a brilliant golden light. A crystal-like light then shot out, entering the golden sphere.

The sphere immediately split into eight pieces, each transforming into a golden symbol that was several feet in size. The symbols merged with the golden glow of the Jinyu Pass.

The thick golden glow surrounding the pass began to fluctuate wildly, then slowly opened a gap just large enough for one person to pass through.

Lan Yan's eyes flashed with joy, and he quickly flew forward, passing through the gap and entering the other side.

Han Li watched, then followed, flying through the gap as well.

As soon as they passed through the restriction, Qi Changlao was about to activate the token to close the exit.

But just as he was about to do so, a sudden change occurred.
