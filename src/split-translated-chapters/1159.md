The golden dragon danced in the air above the flower branch space, emitting a long, dragon-like roar.

The golden dragon's body shone with an intense light, making it impossible to look directly at it, and the law of the universe it emitted was like a mighty mountain, causing the surrounding void to tremble violently.

Han Li's face changed color as he saw this.

This was the flower branch space, and if the space were to shatter, he didn't know what kind of impact it would have.

As he thought, he quickly controlled the golden dragon, retracting its power and flying back.

The golden dragon quickly returned to the lamp flame, disappearing without a trace.

Han Li repeatedly cast spells to stabilize the time law fluctuations within the Years God Lamp.

He looked at the Years God Lamp, recalling the powerful golden dragon he had just seen, and wondered why the power was so great when he activated the Years God Lamp.

In fact, Han Li didn't know that the golden dragon's power was due to the "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique" he had cultivated.

The "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique" was a time-based cultivation technique that seized the essence of the five elements from the flow of time, and Han Li's current cultivation level was not enough, but his time law power was of extremely high quality, far surpassing that of Qi Mozi.

Han Li thought for a moment, but didn't get any leads, so he didn't think about it anymore and continued to cast spells to refine the Years God Lamp.

Although he could control the lamp, he wasn't proficient in it, and needed to continue refining it to control it freely.

Refining the Years God Lamp didn't require his full attention, so he took out the Tian Tian Sword Array diagram and the "Five Thunder True Method Scripture" while casting spells.

He first took out the jade slip containing the "Five Thunder True Method Scripture", and his spiritual sense entered it, carefully flipping through it, revealing a look of surprise.

This "Five Thunder True Method Scripture" was indeed a cultivation technique praised by the Black Heaven Demon Ancestor, and the thunder and lightning cultivation technique it described was not to be underestimated.

According to the scripture, the world's thunder laws were divided into 36 heavenly thunders, 72 earthly thunders, and 108 cloudy thunders.

Han Li had previously seen many thunder and lightning techniques, most of which were cloudy thunders and earthly thunders, while the 36 heavenly thunders were extremely rare and powerful.

Han Li had previously mastered the "Thunder Exorcism Technique", which was one of the 72 earthly thunders, and the "Bone Washing Golden Thunder" in the Gray Boundary Washing Slaughter Pool also belonged to the 72 earthly thunders.

However, the "Five Thunder True Method Scripture" contained many secret techniques for summoning thunder, condensing thunder, and nurturing thunder, which made him feel like his eyes had been opened.

But Han Li didn't delve deeper into the scripture, as the contents were too intricate, and he wasn't cultivating a thunder-based technique.

To be honest, obtaining this jade slip was like finding a treasure.

Han Li didn't have the time to lament about the jade slip, and instead put it away, taking out the Tian Tian Sword Array diagram.

His eyebrows twitched as he probed the diagram with his spiritual sense, and to his surprise, his spiritual sense easily entered the diagram.

Suddenly, a massive amount of information flooded his mind.

This information was too vast, and even with his spiritual sense, it took him a while to fully digest it, revealing a look of surprise on his face.

This was the Tian Tian Sword Array's deployment method and the technique to activate it.

Han Li was familiar with sword arrays, as he had cultivated the Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword, and had seen many sword arrays before.

However, the Tian Tian Sword Array was on a completely different level, and in a certain sense, it was no longer a pure sword array, but a way to communicate with the heavens and the earth through the sword array.

According to the information, the Tian Tian Sword Array was based on the sword diagram, which had no attributes, and therefore didn't require any attributes from the flying swords.

Any flying sword, as long as it reached 36 swords, could be used to deploy the array.

Of course, the quality of the flying swords had to be high, or they wouldn't be able to withstand the array's massive power.

Han Li's mouth curved upwards as he thought that his Qing Zhu Bee Cloud Sword was sufficient in quantity and quality, and would definitely meet the array's requirements.

He closed his eyes for a moment, and then re-examined the sword array information in his mind.
Tian Tian Sword Array's mysteries were unparalleled, and with Han Li's understanding abilities, he couldn't grasp it in a short time, needing time to slowly research it. Wanting to set up the array was not something that could be achieved in a single day.

Just then, his eyebrows suddenly twitched, and a bright red glow flashed on his body.

Han Li put down the Tian Tian Sword diagram, flipped his hand, and took out the Wheel of Reincarnation mask, putting it on his face.

He opened the trading interface, and it turned out that someone had responded to the time law item he had previously posted for sale.

Han Li's heart was filled with joy, and he quickly made a gesture to initiate the transaction.

The trading interface flashed with a dark red glow, and a person's shadow appeared, seemingly a young man, wearing a dark red long robe, with slightly curled black hair. Although his face was covered with a mask, he gave off a feeling of elegance and refinement.

On the mask, the words "Yuan San" were engraved.

"Ah, you're Dragon Five, a renowned figure, I've long heard of your name," Yuan San said with a smile, his voice bright and cheerful.

"Not bad, I am indeed Dragon Five. Do you have the time law materials?" Han Li asked, slightly surprised, as the other party seemed to have heard of him.

"Why else would I contact you, fellow Daoist?" Yuan San chuckled and took out an item, which was a blue crystal the size of a fist, shaped like a water droplet.

Although it was just a virtual image, it was clear that the crystal contained a multitude of golden lights, like the sunset shining on rolling waves, forming a patchwork of golden shadows.

"Water Evolution Time Crystal!" Han Li's eyes lit up, immediately recognizing the blue crystal.

"This is not an ordinary Water Evolution Time Crystal, but the highest-grade Water Evolution Time King Crystal. Although it's only the size of a fist, it contains a rich amount of time law energy, enough to refine a five-grade immortal artifact," Yuan San said with a slight smile.

Han Li nodded, although he could only see a virtual image, he could roughly judge that the time law energy contained within the crystal was not much less than the Fire Age Hive he had previously obtained.

"I don't know what price you're asking for this item, fellow Daoist," Han Li asked, his mind racing.

"I spent all my savings to obtain this Water Evolution Time King Crystal, and I'm not willing to trade it for immortal stones," Yuan San shook his head.

"Then, Yuan San, are you looking to exchange it for something else?" Han Li asked, without showing any surprise.

"You could say that, but it's more accurate to say that I want to make a trade with Dragon Five," Yuan San smiled.

"Please speak your mind, Yuan San," Han Li said.

"Dragon Five, you seem to be a straightforward person, so I'll get straight to the point. I currently need a batch of time law pellets, and I heard that you, Dragon Five, have successfully refined time law pellets. I have ten sets of time law pellet materials, and I'd like to ask you to refine five time law pellets using these materials. If you can do it, I'll give you this Water Evolution Time King Crystal as a gift," Yuan San said, his voice serious.

"If I fail to refine the five time law pellets?" Han Li asked, his eyes flashing.

"If you fail to refine the time law pellets, or if the number is insufficient, sorry, but you won't get anything," Yuan San said calmly.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed upon hearing this.

Although he had the ability to refine pellets, using ten sets of materials to refine five time law pellets was extremely difficult, and he didn't have complete confidence.

"Dragon Five, this trade is extremely beneficial to you, and all the materials are provided by me. You only need to lend a hand, and if you succeed, you'll get the Water Evolution Time King Crystal. Even if you fail, you won't lose anything, so why hesitate?" Yuan San asked, slightly displeased, seeing Han Li's silence.

"Yuan San, don't misunderstand, I'm not hesitating. I've agreed to this trade, but I have two questions I'd like to ask first," Han Li said.

"Please ask, Dragon Five," Yuan San's face relaxed, and he asked.

"Do you have any requirements for the grade of the time law pellets you want me to refine?" Han Li asked.

"Of course, they must be at least second-grade pellets, but don't worry, Dragon Five, the pellet materials I provide contain a rich amount of time law energy. If your refining skills are sufficient, you should be able to refine third-grade pellets," Yuan San said with a smile.

Han Li nodded, his face relaxing.

"If you have any other doubts, please speak up, Dragon Five. This is a trade, after all, and it's best to clarify things now, so we can ensure a smooth transaction," Yuan San added.

"I have one more question, Yuan San. As a fellow Daoist who understands pellet refinement, you should know that refining pellets not only requires skill but also luck. Using ten sets of materials to refine five pellets, even a skilled pellet refiner might not be able to do it. I'll definitely do my best to refine the pellets, but if I'm unlucky and fail to refine five pellets, I'll have wasted my time. Could you, Yuan San, consider selling me the Water Evolution Time King Crystal at a price 30% higher than the market price?" Han Li asked, looking at Yuan San with a sincere expression.

"That's not possible, I'm a man who doesn't go back on his word. If you want the Water Evolution Time King Crystal, you must refine the five time law pellets. If you fail, even if you offer ten times the price, I won't sell it to you," Yuan San shook his head firmly.
