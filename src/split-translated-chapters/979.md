Han Li's expression changed as he witnessed the scene, his thoughts racing with urgency.

Could it be that Shi Zhanfeng hadn't died, but had instead used a secret art to feign death, waiting for an opportunity to steal the heart?

As soon as this thought occurred to him, Han Li's anxiety grew, and he accelerated his speed by nearly half, instantly pouncing towards Shi Zhanfeng's corpse.

A fierce, overwhelming power swooped towards Shi Zhanfeng's head, about to shatter it.

However, just at this moment, a deafening "boom" resounded!

A dazzling, blood-red light erupted from Shi Zhanfeng's body, as a formless, boundless energy burst forth from the light, instantly sweeping across a radius of several dozen feet, not only dispersing Han Li's claw strike but also sending both Han Li and Shi Chongkong flying.

Han Li stumbled, landing more than a dozen feet away, his face slightly discolored.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The blood-red light pulsed like a heartbeat, yet Shi Zhanfeng didn't revive as Han Li had speculated. Instead, his corpse rapidly withered, transforming into a desiccated corpse before Han Li's eyes.

Witnessing this scene, Han Li's eyes widened.

The heart slowly floated out of Shi Zhanfeng's corpse, suspended calmly in mid-air several feet above it, radiating vibrant, blood-red light.

However, the boundless energy had vanished without a trace.

Han Li's eyes sparkled, and he immediately flew forward once more.

Shi Chongkong also charged forward, reaching towards the heart.

Meanwhile, the tiny, purple-robed girl remained stationary, still not making a move.

Xiaozi, what are you doing? Why aren't you acting?" Sha Xin yelled angrily from a distance, her eyes fixed on the scene.

The tiny girl's body trembled, and she came to, looking at the heart as her hands lifted, ready to control the puppets.

Just then, a pained expression flashed across her face, and she clutched her head, collapsing to the ground.

Han Li beat Shi Chongkong to the heart, grabbing it in one swift motion, and then soared towards the tiny girl.

Sha Xin's eyes widened in alarm at this scene, and she hastily formed a hand seal, her fingertips gleaming with golden characters.

A golden light burst forth from the tiny girl's brow, and her expression turned cold once more. She grasped the golden halberd beside her and swung it, her other hand gesturing rapidly.

Layer upon layer of golden, glowing shadows emerged, carrying a golden aura, and swept towards Han Li.

At the same time, the two stationary puppets behind her suddenly sprang to life, charging forward.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and he dodged the puppet's attack, ready to face the two puppets.

"It's enough, stop fighting each other." A voice abruptly resonated within Han Li's mind, and it belonged to Xie Dao.

Han Li reacted to Xie Dao's voice, his heart skipping a beat as he halted, withdrawing several dozen feet.

However, the two puppets also ceased their pursuit.

Han Li pondered Xie Dao's words, his gaze shifting towards Xiaozi and Sha Xin.

Xiaozi's expression remained cold and unchanging, but Sha Xin's face wore a surprised expression, her eyes locking onto Han Li's.

The two exchanged a glance, both detecting something unusual in each other's eyes.

Xie Dao, you've finally appeared. Where are you?" Han Li flew back several dozen feet and asked, his mind connected to Xie Dao.

I'm within the crystal coffin. Just now, my Wooden Heart absorbed a strand of blood lineage power, which allowed me to momentarily awaken. However, I don't have much time, so listen carefully to my next words. Xie Dao hastily replied, his voice urgent.

Han Li heard his words, and countless doubts emerged, but he didn't interrupt.

What I asked of you earlier, to complete a crucial task for my master... actually, my master is myself. My true identity is that of the former master of the Jilian Xian Realm. Many years ago, I was betrayed, gravely injured, and on the brink of death, so I crafted a Xian傀儡 and sealed a portion of my memories within it. I then experienced some events that led me to the lower realms, where I encountered you. Xie Dao continued rapidly.

Han Li heard his words, and his thoughts turned to his encounters with Huang Jinxi. A look of realization dawned on him.

Thanks to your protection, my divided soul safely arrived here, and my revival is at hand. Quickly fuse the Wooden Heart, the Primordial Crystal Core, and my corpse, and with the accumulated power of the immense, dense spiritual energy here, I can recondense a new physical body. After a while, I will be able to revive completely... The task I had you promise to assist me with is to guard this place and prevent anyone from disturbing me during this time... Xie Dao spoke, his voice gradually fading, until it disappeared.

Han Li heard Xie Dao's words, momentarily stunned, but he quickly recovered, his eyes regaining their clarity. He flew towards the crystal coffin at the lake's center.

Shi Chongkong gazed at the heart in Han Li's hand, hesitating to speak, and let out a soft sigh.

From a distance, He Qiong had long noticed the exchange between Han Li and Sha Xin, and upon witnessing the scene, he grew uneasy. "Liuhua, quickly stop that Leng Feiyu!" he shouted.

Liuhua glanced at He Qiong but didn't move.

He Qiong saw this and his anger flared. A faint, bloody glow emerged in his eyes, and a bloody aura erupted from his body, causing his presence to surge. He brandished the Wudong Sword, its black glow surging several times larger, letting out a deafening dragon roar.

As He Qiong readied to swing his sword, a sudden, shrill cry pierced the air, and two golden silhouettes charged forward, toward He Qiong.
E Zhan's eyebrows furrowed, and he immediately dodged to the side while swinging his hand backwards. The Mánlóng sword transformed into a black sword shadow, slashing horizontally at the two wooden puppets.

The two human-shaped puppets reacted extremely quickly, their footsteps immediately adjusting as they continued to stab at E Zhan with the large swords in their hands. At the same time, they held up their shields to resist the Mánlóng sword.

Two loud cracking sounds echoed through the air.

The Mánlóng sword directly shattered the shields of the two human-shaped puppets and then slashed into their bodies, deeply embedding itself within them. However, the strength of this sword strike was completely exhausted.

These two human-shaped puppets had not lost their abilities, and they simultaneously threw away the large swords and shields in their hands. With a loud grunt, they clasped their hands together, tightly embracing the Mánlóng sword. At the same time, a golden light suddenly burst forth from their bodies, releasing a series of explosive fluctuations.

E Zhan's expression changed, and he shook twice, unable to shake off the two puppets. He hastily released the sword hilt and retreated backwards, his body shooting back like an arrow.

Two deafening roars shook the air, and two wheels of golden light appeared, followed by the emergence of a series of cracks in the nearby space.

The entire underground space began to shake violently, with countless rocks falling down, and the blood lake's surface erupted into massive waves.

A figure appeared several hundred meters away, and E Zhan's body shot out of the rubble, his face twisted in a grimace.

However, he gazed emotionlessly at the crystal coffin in the center of the lake, as well as Han Li, who was standing beside it. His eyes flickered with unknown thoughts.

At this moment, the four Xiang Zhàn warrior puppets flew towards him, surrounding him, with "Xiao Zi" sitting on top of the black turtle warrior puppet.

"E Zhan, the saying goes that one's path is broadened by many helpers, but narrowed by few helpers. You've committed heinous crimes, and today is the day you die," Sha Xin laughed coldly, raising her hand.

The four warrior puppets immediately pounced, unleashing a flurry of attacks that rained down on E Zhan.

Han Li quickly walked to the crystal coffin and carefully placed the heart into the skeleton's chest cavity.

The heart's blood light immediately brightened, and the holy skeleton also emitted a dazzling light, as if responding to each other.

Han Li then took out the golden orb and revealed a hint of hesitation on his face.

The heart was naturally placed in the skeleton's chest cavity, but where should the orb be placed? Should it be placed in the skeleton's dantian or head?

"Brother Li, the orb is the holy skeleton's original crystal nucleus. It needs to be merged with the heart to become one," a voice echoed in Han Li's mind, belonging to Liù Huā Furen.

Han Li looked up at Liù Huā Furen and nodded slightly, placing the orb on top of the heart.

The golden orb emitted a brilliant light and merged into the heart.

The originally crimson-colored heart was suddenly enveloped by a dazzling golden light, and its color changed rapidly, transforming into a pure golden color within several breaths. At the same time, it grew several dozen times larger, perfectly matching the massive skeleton.

The golden heart began to beat powerfully, overflowing with new life.

A massive golden light column erupted from the skeleton's body, shooting upwards with a deafening roar, as if it were a long-repressed scream of joy.

A vast and boundless aura exploded from the light column, causing the surrounding space to violently tremble.

Han Li's body was also repelled by this immense aura, and he stumbled backwards several steps before stabilizing himself. A hint of shock flashed in his eyes.

The blood lake immediately began to churn, with waves overflowing towards the crystal coffin, pouring into the skeleton's body, and flowing into the golden heart.

Blood lights began to burst forth from the heart, spreading throughout the skeleton's body.

The skeleton's skin rapidly produced numerous flesh buds, which merged together to form a layer of flesh and blood.

As the surrounding blood converged, the holy skeleton's flesh and blood rapidly increased...

At this time, the blood lake's edge was already in chaos, with half of the dome having collapsed. The sky above was visible, but it had already turned dark, with only starlight illuminating the area, devoid of any moonlight.

"You're seeking death, Lǐ Fēi Yǔ!" a loud shout tore through the night air.

The next moment, the entire blood lake violently shook, and Han Li's eyebrows furrowed as he turned to see E Zhan, whose eyes were wide with anger, staring in his direction. A mixture of shock and fury still lingered on his face.

Sha Xin's emotions were the exact opposite, and she was overjoyed in her heart. She shouted loudly, "Don't let him escape! He absolutely cannot be allowed to obstruct our master's plans!"

"Yes!" Kūn Yù and "Xiao Zi" responded in unison.

The two of them began to frantically chant incantations, their faces pale and bloodless.

The dragon-shaped warrior puppet, which was one of the four Heavenly Trigrams warrior puppets, sat in the east, its mouth spewing forth a deafening roar. The air was filled with swirling clouds and a scorching heat, which contained a powerful corroding aura.

The tiger-shaped warrior puppet crouched in the west, its mouth wide open, as a fierce gale howled out, carrying sharp, blade-like winds that swept across the area.

The black turtle warrior puppet guarded the north, spewing forth a green light that generated an immense water pressure, making it seem as if one was carrying a massive mountain on their back, or sinking into a swamp.

The Vermilion Bird warrior puppet hovered in the south, its body ablaze with fierce flames. As it opened its mouth to let out a long cry, a line of scorching flames shot out, incinerating everything in their path.

E Zhan had not expected that, after Sha Xin had given the Heavenly Trigrams warrior puppets' absolute killing array to her two subordinates, they would be able to unleash such powerful strength, completely suppressing him and making it impossible for him to escape for the time being.
