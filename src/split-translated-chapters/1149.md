Han Li saw this situation, first stunned, then no longer thinking about it, and concentrated on listening.

He initially had a somewhat casual expression, but after listening for a moment, his face gradually became focused, and finally revealed a look of being intoxicated.

Milo Laizu was not talking about the secrets of the "Great Five Elements Fantasy World Secret" at this moment, but Han Li could hear that every word was closely related to the "Great Five Elements Fantasy World Secret".

The oral formula of the "Great Five Elements Fantasy World Secret" flowed through Han Li's mind, and with Milo Laizu's lecture, it mutually confirmed and deepened his understanding of the technique. The originally unclear places gradually had a feeling of sudden enlightenment.

Time passed bit by bit, and in the blink of an eye, more than half a day had passed.

Milo Laizu's lecture suddenly stopped, and Han Li was suddenly startled, looking up at the peak, but it was Mu Yan who opened his mouth to ask a question.

Seeing this scene, Han Li secretly admired Mu Yan, who had someone to ask for guidance.

He had listened to Milo Laizu's lecture and had a deeper understanding of the "Great Five Elements Fantasy World Secret", but at the same time, he had many doubts about the technique, unfortunately, he had no one to ask.

Milo Laizu casually answered Mu Yan's questions and continued to lecture.

Han Li quickly continued to listen, comprehending the technique.

Milo Laizu lectured for a while, then suddenly stopped again, looking at a place in the void with a look of surprise.

Mu Yan and the others also woke up from their trance-like state, looking in that direction with anger on their faces.

"Who dares to sneak a peek?" Mu Yan suddenly stood up, shouting.

Milo Laizu's lips moved slightly, and a formless force surged out, hitting the void.

The void "boomed" and shattered, and the formless force immediately penetrated into the depths of the void, forming a faintly visible path, extending to unknown places.

A faint, brittle sound came from the depths of the space channel, as if something had shattered.

Han Li saw this scene, and his eyebrows twitched.

Wasn't this the same scene as when he had sneaked a listen to the lecture, and was discovered by Milo Laizu? No wonder he had found the lecture familiar.

Milo Laizu raised his hand again, and a golden light shot out, sweeping past the shattered void.

The shattered void instantly recovered, returning to its original state.

"Sit down, don't be alarmed," he said calmly.

Mu Yan and the others heard his words, and their expressions returned to calm, sitting down.

"Master, who was sneaking a peek? Could it be someone from the Heavenly Court?" Qimozi frowned and asked.

Milo Laizu's face was calm, and he shook his head, not speaking, but his gaze turned, looking at the middle of the mountain.

In the middle of the mountain, Han Li's heart skipped a beat.

Although Milo Laizu had only glanced at him casually, and he was still in a hidden state, using the "Wan Kong Xuan Ji" technique, he knew that Milo Laizu was looking at him.

His hiding and secrets were all useless in front of Milo Laizu.

"Milo Laizu has discovered me, should I escape?" Han Li's heart was shocked, and he instinctively wanted to flee.

But on the mountain peak, Milo Laizu retracted his gaze, no longer paying attention to Han Li, and began to lecture again.

Han Li's eyes flashed, and he was about to flee, but his body stopped.

He didn't understand Milo Laizu's true strength, but judging from the feeling of that one glance, Milo Laizu was far more powerful than Hei Tian Mo Zu. If he wanted to catch him, he wouldn't be able to escape.

Since that was the case, he might as well be more relaxed, and besides, he was cultivating the "Great Five Elements Fantasy World Secret", and was half a true disciple of the Zhenyan Sect. Even if he was caught by Milo Laizu, he shouldn't be harmed.

Thinking this, Han Li's heart calmed down, and he sat down, continuing to listen.

Milo Laizu lectured for another half day, and then announced the end of the lecture.

The Zhenyan Sect disciples below bowed respectfully to the mountain peak, and then left, Mu Yan and the others also did the same, and soon the mountain peak was left with only Milo Laizu.

"Come out," Milo Laizu said calmly after a moment of silence.

Behind Milo Laizu, the void flashed, and Han Li's figure appeared out of thin air.

"I pay my respects to Elder Milo!" he bowed.

Milo Laizu slowly turned around, looking Han Li up and down, a smile on his face, and said, "Not bad, not bad."

"I, a junior, happened to be here, and heard Elder speaking, feeling the profundity, so I hid my tracks and listened, I hope Elder won't blame me," Han Li said, being looked at by Milo Laizu in a way that made him feel inexplicable.

"This is nothing, you have cultivated the 'Great Five Elements Fantasy World Secret', so you are naturally a disciple of the Zhenyan Sect, listening to me lecture, what's wrong with that?" Milo Laizu asked with a smile.

Han Li wasn't surprised that Milo Laizu had discovered his technique, and Milo Laizu's smile was kind and without hostility, making him feel a sense of relief.

"Was the person who sneaked a peek at my lecture also you? And you, although you are in the present, are not a person of the present, this world actually has a treasure that can traverse time and space, it's simply unbelievable," Milo Laizu said with a sigh.
Han Li's heart was shocked, and he couldn't believe that Mi Luo Lao Zu had seen through everything with just one glance.

His mouth twitched slightly, but he didn't say a word.

The Palm of Heaven was his greatest secret, and he naturally wouldn't tell Mi Luo Lao Zu.

"You can rest assured, I won't take your treasure. This treasure is extraordinary, and you should be careful to keep it safe," Mi Luo Lao Zu said with a smile, as if he had seen through Han Li's concerns.

"I dare not," Han Li replied in a low voice.

"What's your name?" Mi Luo Lao Zu asked, his eyes shining with a hint of kindness.

"I'm Han Li," Han Li replied after a moment of hesitation.

"Ah, Han Li... your name is not bad. Are you willing to become my disciple?" Mi Luo Lao Zu asked with a smile.

His words were like a sudden storm, leaving Han Li stunned.

"I've been very strict in accepting disciples, and so far, I've only taken six. However, a wise person once told me that I would have seven disciples in my lifetime, and the last one would inherit my legacy. You are the only one in the world, besides me, who has mastered the 'Great Five Elements Illusion Technique'. It seems that you are the seventh disciple destined to inherit my legacy," Mi Luo Lao Zu said with a nostalgic expression.

Han Li listened, his eyes wide with shock, but he quickly regained his composure, his eyes flashing with a hint of uncertainty.

Mi Luo Lao Zu's words were tempting, but Han Li wasn't willing to bow down immediately.

"Han Li, you don't have to make a decision now. Come with me to the True Word Sect and take a look," Mi Luo Lao Zu said with a gentle smile.

"I will follow your instructions," Han Li replied, nodding his head.

Mi Luo Lao Zu nodded, seemingly satisfied with Han Li's respect, and then waved his hand.

A golden light shot out from his hand, unfolding into a golden pathway that stretched out before them, leading into the depths of the void.

"Come," Mi Luo Lao Zu said to Han Li.

Han Li looked at the golden pathway, his eyes flashing with excitement, and then stepped onto it.

As soon as his feet touched the pathway, a strange temporal law force erupted from beneath his feet, enveloping his body.

The scenery around him began to change rapidly, and he felt himself being pulled into a temporal tunnel.

Han Li's heart was shocked, but the next moment, the changing scenery around him suddenly disappeared.

He found himself standing in a golden space, and his eyes widened in shock.

He looked up at the sky, and his eyes flashed with a hint of surprise.

Since he had cultivated the "Heavenly Executioner's Prison Technique" and merged the true spirit bloodline's power within him, he had gained a deeper understanding of the true spirit bloodline.

The Tian Feng bloodline was the first true spirit bloodline he had merged, and he had a deep understanding of its power. He was also more sensitive to spatial forces.

He could feel that the golden space he was in was far away from the previous location, far exceeding the limits of his Thunderbolt Array's transmission. Mi Luo Lao Zu's golden pathway had brought them here in an instant.

What shocked Han Li even more was that he hadn't felt any spatial force fluctuations.

"This is the True Word Sect's 'Ten Directions Great Path' technique, which can also achieve spatial displacement. However, it doesn't use spatial forces, but rather temporal forces," Mi Luo Lao Zu explained.

Han Li's heart was shocked once again.

In the True Immortal Realm, the major cities and sects had all set up spatial restrictions to prevent people from using spatial displacement techniques to sneak in. But if one could master this "Ten Directions Great Path" technique, wouldn't they be able to easily bypass those restrictions?

"Who would have thought that there was such a technique in the temporal laws?" Han Li exclaimed.

"The True Word Sect has been researching temporal laws for countless years, and we have numerous techniques. The 'Ten Directions Great Path' is just one of them. Since you're interested in temporal law techniques, come with me," Mi Luo Lao Zu said with a smile, waving his hand to release a golden light that enveloped Han Li.

Han Li's eyes flashed, and he allowed himself to be carried away by Mi Luo Lao Zu, gazing at the surrounding golden space.

This place seemed to be a secret realm similar to the Tai Sui Immortal Palace, with majestic buildings that towered above, more magnificent than the ones he had seen in the True Word Sect.

Many True Word Sect disciples were cultivating here, as if this was another True Word Sect.

"This is the True Word Mystic Realm, a realm created by the True Word Sect's ancestors. This is the true foundation of the True Word Sect," Mi Luo Lao Zu explained, his voice filled with pride.

"Indeed, it's magnificent," Han Li replied, nodding his head.

As he looked around, his eyes suddenly widened in shock.

He had been so caught up in his conversation with Mi Luo Lao Zu that he hadn't noticed the temporal law fluctuations in the space around him, similar to the ones in the Tai Sui Immortal Palace's Sui Yue Tower.

However, the temporal forces in the Sui Yue Tower were intended to weaken the prisoners, whereas the ones here were different, without any malicious intent. They were accelerating the flow of time in this realm.

The time flow rate around him was about 50% faster than outside, and as Mi Luo Lao Zu moved forward, the time flow rate increased.

Two times, three times, five times, ten times...

As they moved forward, Han Li's expression became increasingly shocked.
