A burst of sword light and rod shadows tore through the void, colliding with each other in a deafening explosion.

A massive wave of chaotic energy swept out in all directions, and amidst the turbulent air, a golden dragon and a giant Peng bird could be seen rushing past, tearing through the illusory mountain peaks conjured by the rod shadows. A giant ape followed closely behind, its arms swinging wildly as it charged towards She Chen, slamming down towards her.

The massive rod shadow shattered first, and the lightning-filled sword blade descended in a swift cut.

"Impossible..."

She Chen's voice trembled as she uttered a cry of shock, and her Wolf Tooth Rod cracked open with a loud "crack" sound.

A gaping wound appeared on her shoulder and chest, and she felt the golden lightning coursing through her body, seeping into her internal organs.

She Chen's outer skin was tough, and her physical strength was among the top among the early-stage Da Luo cultivators, but her internal organs were somewhat special, and her ability to withstand damage was much weaker.

If she allowed the lightning to wreak havoc unimpeded, it could potentially affect her future cultivation foundation.

After a moment of deliberation, She Chen steeled herself and suddenly plummeted downwards, falling into the muddy ground below.

Jing Liu saw this and knew something was amiss. He flashed a hint of light and prepared to flee.

However, before he could react, a red light flashed, and Jiao San appeared before him.

"Where do you think you're going?" Jiao San cried out in a sharp voice.

On the other side, Huo San had already blocked his escape route.

Han Li, on the other hand, didn't immediately give chase. Instead, he maintained his giant demon form, suspended in mid-air, scanning the ground below with his angry gaze, searching for She Chen's trail.

Just then, a mournful cry echoed from beneath the ground, and a figure surrounded by silver flames burst forth from the earth, flying into the high sky.

Her clothes were tattered, her hair disheveled, and her body covered in wounds, looking utterly wretched. It was She Chen.

A giant firebird with silver flames surrounding its body followed closely behind, chasing after her.

Han Li saw this and, with a wicked grin, charged towards She Chen, who was desperately trying to flee. He swung his sword once more, unleashing a fierce slash.

A brilliant sword light illuminated the sky, and a massive sword shadow tore through the air, descending towards She Chen with incredible force.

The Lanyuan siblings watched this scene unfold, their expressions turning complex. They had a special relationship with She Chen, and seeing her in such a perilous state, they couldn't just stand by and do nothing.

Just as they were about to intervene, She Chen's face twisted in a snarl, and she let out a crazed roar: "Today's debt will be repaid tomorrow!"

As soon as she spoke, her brow split open, revealing a bloodied mouth, and a small, snow-white orb the size of a dragon's eye shot out from within, flying towards Han Li's sword shadow.

"This is terrible, she's going to self-destruct her demonic core!" Lei Yu Ce exclaimed, instinctively shielding Su Ci beside him.

"No, that's her Toad Moon Pearl!" the Lanyuan siblings cried out in unison, halting their footsteps in surprise.

Jiao San's heart skipped a beat upon hearing this. According to legend, among the toad-like demonic creatures, there existed a special Moon Palace breed, which possessed, aside from their primary demonic core, a Toad Moon Pearl that could absorb moonlight, allowing them to boost their cultivation speed.

The importance of this pearl was second only to the demonic core and the yuan ying.

She Chen's true body was clearly of this breed, and her cultivation had reached the Da Luo realm. The Toad Moon Pearl within her had accumulated moonlight for countless years, containing unfathomable power. If it were to explode, the consequences would be catastrophic.

The crowd realized the gravity of the situation and hastily retreated, fleeing in all directions.

Xiong Shan, knowing his own strength was the weakest, was the first to escape, fleeing to a distant location.

Han Li, too, sensed something was amiss, but it was too late to recall his sword.

The Toad Moon Pearl flew into the range of the lightning-filled sword shadow, causing it to tremble violently before exploding with a deafening "boom".

The sky above was initially bright, then suddenly darkened, as if night had fallen. A cold, silvery moonlight descended, casting a layer of frost over the surrounding area.

The space around them seemed to solidify, only to shatter with a loud "crack" sound.

It was as if a silver mirror had shattered, revealing a network of dark, gleaming spatial rifts. The air was filled with the sound of space winds, and the power of the spatial laws emanating from within was awe-inspiring.

Jiao San and the others watched in shock as the rifts spread, their faces pale.

They hastily employed their techniques to avoid the rifts, but there were too many, and everyone was left stumbling about, looking disheveled.

Su Ci, caught off guard, almost got swallowed by a rift that appeared behind her. Fortunately, Lei Yu Ce, despite his injuries, managed to react in time, saving her from the brink of disaster.

After being saved by him twice, Su Ci, even with her icy demeanor, couldn't help but feel a spark of warmth towards Lei Yu Ce.
On the other side, Jing Liu was not as fortunate. Earlier, he was surrounded by the crowd in the center, so he was the last to leave. As soon as he flew out over a thousand feet, he was met with a massive rift that tore through the air.

Although he forcibly twisted his body to avoid the rift, he was still unable to escape. The powerful force emanating from the rift pulled him in, inch by inch, and even his nascent soul was unable to escape.

In the center of the void where the Crab Moon Pearl had shattered, there were dense rifts everywhere. Si Yuan's figure had already disappeared, leaving only Han Li behind. He was suspended in mid-air, with a golden treasure wheel glowing brightly behind him, emitting a warm light that was slowing down the expansion of the rifts.

As everyone looked on, they saw Han Li holding a green gourd in his hand, pointing its mouth at the void in front of him.

A green whirlpool swirled out of the gourd's mouth, gathering up the silver-white crystals scattered throughout the void. The crystals slowly coalesced into a small, snow-white pellet, which was the Crab Moon Pearl.

This object had accumulated the essence of countless years of moonlight, and Han Li felt that it would be of great use to him. He carefully collected it.

After that, he summoned the Fire Bird back to his side, and his figure flashed through the dense rifts, flying back down to the ground.

Regarding the previous battle, everyone remained silent, no one mentioning it. They all just took medicine and meditated for a while.

"Thank you all," Han Li said, standing up and bowing slightly to the crowd.

Earlier, these people had not attacked him, despite Si Yuan's provocation. Although it was partly due to their own self-preservation and desire to conserve their strength, in the end, they had helped him.

"Brother Han relied on his own strength to deal with it, it has nothing to do with us," Lei Yu Ce said, recovering somewhat.

"Brother Han single-handedly resisted a Da Luo cultivator, I'm truly impressed," Xiong Shan said, his eyes fixed on Han Li with a complex expression.

Jiao San, on the other hand, was deep in thought, weighing his options.

"We shouldn't delay, let's continue on our way," Han Li said, his brow furrowed.

Everyone nodded in agreement, and they set off once again, entering the light screen within the stone gate.

Han Li's vision blurred, and when he came to, he found himself in a large, gray cave.

The cave was enormous, stretching out into the distance, and it was dark and cold. The air was filled with the howling of wind, and the stone walls were covered in a layer of black frost.

Lei Yu Ce and the others also appeared, looking around cautiously.

Han Li looked around for a while, his brow furrowed in concern.

The first to enter, Qu Lin, was nowhere to be seen. Had he already left, heading deeper into the cave?

The others soon discovered Qu Lin's absence, and their expressions turned solemn. Lei Yu Ce, Huo San, and Jiao San, in particular, looked anxious.

"Let's go, let's take a look," Han Li said, leading the way. "This place seems strange, it's not a good place. Everyone be careful."

He had just displayed his power, and the others did not think it was a problem. They followed him, walking cautiously.

The seventh layer of the cave was even more restrictive on one's spiritual sense, and everyone's spiritual sense could only extend 20-30 li before being suppressed. Therefore, they chose to walk instead of flying.

However, the cave was unexpectedly long, and they walked for over half an hour without seeing any signs of the end. The wind grew stronger, and the air grew colder.

"Be careful!" Han Li warned, his footsteps slowing.

As soon as he spoke, a black light flashed in the distance, and seven or eight black shadows shot out, revealing several humanoid wolves with black and red fur.

These creatures were over a dozen feet long, with long, black-red fur covering their bodies. They charged towards the group, their speed and attack power extremely high.

A black wind burst forth from their claws, leaving deep gashes on the ground and walls. The wounds were black and charred, as if corroded.

"What are these things?" Lei Yu Ce and the others exclaimed, but they did not panic. They raised their hands, and a wave of sword energy and water arrows shot out, striking the wolf-like creatures.

The creatures let out a mournful howl, and a black-red flame erupted from their mouths, forming a sea of flames that tried to block the group's attacks.

However, the group's attacks were too powerful, and the flames were easily pierced. The creatures were quickly torn apart, their bodies disintegrating into black smoke.

But they left behind a number of black-red pearls, each the size of a fist, emitting a soft, gentle glow.

"What are these pearls?" Wen Zhong exclaimed, raising his hand to grab them.

"Wait, don't touch those magic pearls!" Han Li warned, but it was too late. Wen Zhong's golden light had already touched the pearls.

The pearls exploded, releasing a blast of black-red light that filled the air.
