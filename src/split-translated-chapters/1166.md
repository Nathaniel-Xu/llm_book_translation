The old man finished speaking, then withdrew his gaze, losing interest, and turned to leave the city head.

As he took a step away, he suddenly remembered something, and his lips moved as he transmitted his voice to Qingdian: "The human's life and death are at his own discretion, but the Tian Huo tribe's people cannot be harmed."

After receiving Qingdian's affirmative response, the old man finally left.

Qingdian, who had obtained the old man's tacit approval, had a sly smile on his face, and his two protruding fangs glinted with a cold light.

"Rooooo!"

He suddenly opened his mouth and let out a loud roar.

A red glow spread out from his mouth, forming a huge blood-red vortex that emitted a powerful attractive force, enveloping Han Li.

Han Li had already sensed the anomaly and had reversed the rotation of the true speech treasure wheel in his body. Before being bound by the force, he had already blurred and flashed out of his original position.

However, as soon as he moved, he felt a numbness in his entire shoulder, and the place where he had been injured by the magma suddenly felt an inexplicable, strange power surging out, as if it was resonating with the attractive force emitted by Qingdian's mouth.

No matter where he moved, the force would follow him, and the blood-red vortex would sweep in.

As time passed, the attractive force grew stronger, and the blood-red vortex's speed increased.

Finally, the force surged to the point where Han Li's time law power could not withstand it, and his body was torn apart, moving horizontally, and he fell into the blood-red vortex, being enveloped and disappearing.

"Brother!" Liu Le'er cried out, but it was too late.

She glared at Qingdian, who responded with a smug smile, looking completely unconcerned.

The surrounding crowd erupted in a cacophony of voices, with many people sighing in dismay, but no one dared to say anything.

Sang Tu and Yun Bao's faces had turned pale, and they stared blankly at the direction Han Li had disappeared in, exchanging worried glances.

Under the crowd's astonished gaze, Liu Le'er seemed to calm down, and she walked towards Qingdian, step by step.

...

At this moment, Han Li entered a strange, empty space, suspended in mid-air, surrounded by a foul, pungent smell.

In front of him, a magma waterfall cascaded down, and beneath him, a lake of magma churned, with bubbles constantly rising and bursting.

Han Li wrinkled his nose, composed himself, and looked around, but the surrounding space was not too large, with dark red walls on all sides, flowing with crimson magma, like a living creature.

As he pondered, his eyes turned a deep purple, and he scanned the surroundings.

In his gaze, he discovered that beneath the irregular walls, there were veins of channels distributing, with threads of immortal energy flowing through them.

"Strange... Could this be the inside of that guy's belly? I couldn't have been swallowed by him, could I?" Han Li thought, his mind filled with doubts, and he couldn't help but touch his nose, muttering to himself.

Just as he was wondering, the dark red walls around him began to convulse violently, squeezing towards the center, continuously shrinking the surrounding space.

The magma waterfall above him also became turbulent, and a wave of intense heat surged towards Han Li.

Han Li's heart tightened, and he swung his hands to the left and right, releasing a burst of green light, and thirty-six green bamboo swords shot out, their blades flashing with light, splitting into numerous green sword lights that shot out in all directions.

The small space was filled with the sound of swords clashing, and the sword lights were dazzling.

However, despite the swords' ferocity, the walls around him remained unmoved, and he could not break through.

As the walls continued to shrink, Han Li's range of movement decreased, and the dense sword lights disappeared.

The magma waterfall above him finally fell onto his body.

Han Li felt an immense weight crushing him, and his body plummeted, falling into the lake of magma below, being engulfed by the scorching hot magma, his entire body burning with pain.

He knew that if the surrounding space was completely closed, he would be sealed within the magma lake, and although he might not be in danger of losing his life in the short term, he could not guarantee that something unexpected would not happen over time.

As he thought, he saw his hand shoot up towards the sky, and the thirty-six green bamboo swords merged into one, shooting out like a dragon, and suddenly broke through the lake, creating a path through the squeezing walls.

Han Li's body was like lightning, closely following the sword, and he flew out, his other hand holding the Xuan Tian gourd, which emitted a green light, spinning and absorbing the magma waterfall that was falling from above.

Without the obstruction of the waterfall, the air in front of him was still scorching hot, but it could no longer block Han Li's advance.

After rushing out about a hundred meters, Han Li finally escaped the squeezing walls, and his body rose and fell several times before landing on a domed, empty space.
In front of the empty land, a lava waterfall cascaded down from the middle, flowing smoothly downwards.

Han Li's figure flickered, using the momentum of the Xuantian Gourd to pass through the lava waterfall, and discovered that the area behind was even more desolate, with only two white stone pillars standing in front, emitting a faint aura of sealing power.

"Ah, I've finally found the way..." Han Li's heart was filled with joy, and he put away the Qingtian Bee Cloud Sword and the Xuantian Gourd.

He gazed at the two white stone pillars, stroking his chin, and carefully examined them.

...

Meanwhile, outside the city gate, Liu Le'er was pointing at Qingdian, questioning him:

"Where did you take my brother? Why can't I sense his aura?"

"That little brat has already entered my inner space, and it won't take long for him to be melted by the yuan fire lava. You naturally won't be able to sense his aura. Little sister, why don't you acknowledge me as your big brother? Ha ha!" Qingdian looked at Liu Le'er, who was less than half his height, and laughed loudly.

"Pitiful, truly pitiful..."

Liu Le'er heard these words, but instead of being shocked, she seemed to relax a bit, and said:

Qingdian thought Liu Le'er was talking about Han Li, but seeing her expression change, he felt a bit puzzled.

"You dare to swallow Stone Brother into your belly, you'll regret it... no, I should say, you're already too late to regret it... pitiful..." Liu Le'er suddenly revealed a sympathetic expression, and said.

Qingdian heard this, and his heart skipped a beat, feeling a sense of unease.

The next instant, a loud rumbling sound came from his mouth, followed by a burst of dark light.

Immediately, his figure lunged forward, stumbled, and almost fell, his mouth bleeding profusely, a protruding fang broke off from its root, flying out like a curved knife, and nailed itself into the city wall.

"Whoa!" the dark light disappeared, revealing a three-headed, six-armed demon god's figure.

Its true spirit bloodline was stimulated to the extreme, causing the surrounding onlookers to feel an overwhelming urge to worship.

"I knew you'd be fine." Liu Le'er saw Han Li's appearance, and although she flashed a hint of surprise, she still smiled and said.

Han Li nodded slightly at Liu Le'er, and looked at Qingdian.

"No..."

Qingdian's mouth was bleeding, and he stared at the broken fang on the wall, his anger reaching a boiling point.

These two fangs, which he had used countless treasures to refine for years, were equivalent to a six-grade immortal artifact, and were crucial to sealing his inner space. Now that Han Li had broken one of them, it was as if he had opened the floodgates, and the cost of repairing it would be enormous. How could he not be furious?

"You little brat, I'll kill you..." Qingdian's voice exploded, his body enveloped in a red glow, and his figure began to rapidly expand, soon surpassing the city wall.

The dark red markings on his body began to spread, his pupils turned completely red, and a pink mist began to emanate from his body, as if he was about to reveal his true form.

Han Li saw this, and no longer suppressed his aura, his true spirit bloodline and the Tianxia Town Prison technique operating at full strength, his body began to rapidly expand, not inferior to Qingdian.

The onlookers saw this, and knowing that the two were about to engage in a life-or-death battle, they retreated to a safer distance.

At this moment, a figure appeared from the sky, descending onto Qingdian's shoulder.

Qingdian was stepped on, and his figure suddenly shrunk, his hand pausing in mid-air, ready to strike.

But when he saw the person's face, he immediately regained his composure, stopped his hand, and his body began to rapidly shrink, returning to its original size.

Han Li's gaze swept over, and he saw that the person standing on Qingdian's shoulder was a tall, handsome young man, dressed in a white robe, with snow-white long hair tied up in a high bun, looking elegant and extraordinary.

"Brother Han, long time no see..." the young man greeted Han Li.

Han Li didn't recognize this person, but after sensing his aura, his face revealed a hint of realization.

This person was none other than Li Qi, who had been imprisoned in the Years Tower.

The surrounding crowd saw him, and their faces changed, rushing to pay their respects, even Qingdian and Liu Le'er didn't dare to be slow.

Han Li thought back to the Huayu scale, and immediately guessed Li Qi's identity, his eyes flashing with realization, and his body rapidly shrinking back to its original size.

Qingdian had calmed down, and seeing that Li Qi seemed to know Han Li, he didn't dare to act rashly, standing quietly to the side, his face filled with doubt.
