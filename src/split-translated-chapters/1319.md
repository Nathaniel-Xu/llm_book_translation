Inside the secret room.

Han Li's face was solemn, as he was currently engraving the array pattern on the ground, setting up the same spell formation he had used to behead the evil corpse last time.

After completing the array pattern, he took out a stack of array flags, array disks, and other items, and began to set up the formation.

This spell formation was extremely complex, and even with his previous experience, it took him a whole day to set everything up. A yin-yang dual-fish shaped formation appeared in the room.

Innumerable thumb-sized talismans danced within the formation, emitting a radiant glow that enveloped the entire secret room in a sea of light.

Han Li scanned the room with his eyes, nodded in satisfaction, and waved his hand to summon a Earth Immortal puppet. He placed it at the yin fish position of the yin-yang formation, while he himself sat at the yang fish position.

He calmed his mind and immediately began to activate the formation.

A half-spherical solid light screen emerged, enveloping him and the Earth Immortal puppet. A series of flame, cold air, and lightning formed into chains that shot out from the light screen, piercing the puppet's body.

After completing these preparations, Han Li closed his eyes and entered his spiritual sea.

Unlike the previous time when he had beheaded the evil corpse, his spiritual sea was now tranquil. A figure clad in white robes, Han Li, sat cross-legged, eyes closed, and meditating.

"Have you arrived?" The white-robed Han Li opened his eyes, looked over, and smiled peacefully, without any hint of conflict.

"You're waiting for me?" Han Li's heart was surprised, and he secretly accumulated his strength, his face expressionless.

"You don't need to be so cautious, I'm not an evil corpse, and I don't intend to fight you. Please sit." The white-robed Han Li smiled faintly and pointed.

A cushion and a tea table appeared in front of him, with a teapot and two tea cups on the table.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, these objects were all condensed from spiritual energy, and they looked identical to real objects.

This level of spiritual energy manipulation was beyond his own capabilities, and the good corpse in front of him had accomplished it with ease.

"What do you mean?" Han Li sat down cross-legged, asking.

"You and I are born from the same root, and the three corpses and the main body competing for the physical body is only natural. However, to decide who occupies the physical body, it's not necessarily a fight." The white-robed Han Li poured two cups of tea, one of which he pushed towards Han Li, and the other he himself lifted to take a sip.

"We cultivators don't decide the outcome through fighting, so how can we decide?" Han Li didn't touch the tea.

"It's simple, let's discuss the Dao." The white-robed Han Li smiled lightly.

"Discuss the Dao?" Han Li's eyebrows furrowed slightly.

"Not wrong, I want to discuss the Dao of good and evil with you, friend. If your answers can satisfy me, I'll be willing to give up competing for this physical body." The white-robed Han Li said.

"Ah..." Han Li's eyebrows twitched.

"Of course, if your answers can't satisfy me, then don't blame me for taking action." The white-robed Han Li added.

"Then you can try." Han Li's eyes gleamed with sharpness, and he laughed loudly.

A powerful spiritual energy burst forth from his body, causing the surrounding spiritual energy space to tremble violently, as if the heavens were shaking with anger.

The white-robed Han Li's teacup shattered with a loud crash, turning into nothingness.

"Not bad, you have some ability." The white-robed Han Li's eyebrows furrowed slightly, before relaxing into a smile.

As he spoke, his hand flashed with a soft glow, and another brand-new teacup condensed into existence.

"You want to discuss the Dao, so I'll naturally accompany you. What do you want to ask?" Han Li's aura also retreated, and he spoke calmly.

"Good, then I'll ask you, friend, why do people have good and evil?" The white-robed Han Li asked.

"People are inherently neither good nor evil, what is considered good or evil is determined by one's heart." Han Li replied calmly.

If he had been asked to discuss good and evil before, he might not have been able to articulate his thoughts, but after his experiences in the small town of Xiangyi, and reading many classics on the subject, he had gained a deeper understanding and insight into the nature of good and evil.

"There's a saying that good deeds will be rewarded, and evil deeds will be punished, but in reality, it's not that simple. Many people do good deeds, but their families are poor and struggling, while others do evil deeds, but they live a life of luxury and ease. Why is that?" The white-robed Han Li asked further.

"Your question is only a leaf that blocks the view, and you can't see the mountain. What is good, and what is evil, can't be judged solely by appearances. As long as it benefits others, and benefits the world, even if it's hurting or scolding others, it's still considered good. On the other hand, if it's only for one's own purposes, even if it's flattering or pleasing others, it becomes evil. If a person does good deeds and accumulates virtue, even if their life is poor, their descendants will often prosper, and if a person cheats and takes advantage of others, even if they gain temporary wealth and power, they will ultimately have no good outcome." Han Li replied calmly.

The white-robed Han Li listened to his words, nodded slightly, and then asked further:

"What is good, and what is evil?"

"Benefiting oneself and others is considered good, benefiting others but not oneself is considered great good. Not benefiting oneself or others is considered evil, benefiting oneself but not others is considered great evil." Han Li replied calmly.

"Does doing something that benefits others make it good?" The white-robed Han Li asked faintly.

"Not necessarily, if one's intention is to do good, even if it's not rewarded, it's still considered good. But if one's intention is to gain something, even if it's a good deed, it's only pseudo-good. If one does good deeds without seeking reward, that's true goodness." Han Li shook his head.
An old man fell into the water, and a young merchant who was passing by rescued him. The old man gave the merchant a silver ingot as a thank you gift, and the merchant happily accepted it. Was this act of kindness truly good?

Han Li's eyes gleamed with satisfaction as he asked again.

"It was good," Han Li said.

"But didn't you just say that true kindness is not seeking reward? The merchant accepted the silver ingot, isn't that a reward? How can you say it's good?" the white-robed Han Li asked.

"No matter whether the merchant thought about the reward before saving the old man, the fact that this act of kindness will encourage others to do good is what matters. As long as it's beneficial to all living beings, it can be considered good," Han Li said.

"There's a saying in the world: 'good people are often deceived.' What do you think about this?" the white-robed Han Li asked.

"This kind of thing does exist in the world, but it's only a minority. We must have a broad-minded and tolerant attitude towards these injustices, so that we can stand firm and not fall. If we harbor resentment, we will fall to a lower level," Han Li said.

"I didn't expect you to understand the true meaning of kindness so deeply. I'm impressed. I have one more question, please answer," the white-robed Han Li said, his eyes gleaming with curiosity.

"Please ask," Han Li said with a smile.

"People in the world often talk about the Dao, but when it comes to action, they often have high ambitions but low abilities. You have a deep understanding of the true meaning of kindness, but how should we specifically cultivate kindness?" the white-robed Han Li asked, his eyes fixed intently on Han Li.

"Towards all things, there is no attachment or rejection; towards all events, there is no contamination or grasping; towards all situations, there is no movement or disturbance; towards all times, always act with convenience and follow the crowd, making everyone happy. This is the method of cultivating kindness," Han Li said, his voice low and calm.

The white-robed Han Li murmured to himself, "Towards all things, there is no attachment or rejection; towards all events, there is no contamination or grasping; towards all situations, there is no movement or disturbance; towards all times, always act with convenience..."

"Haha, good, your four sentences are excellent! I'm impressed!" the white-robed Han Li exclaimed, clapping his hands in laughter.

As the white-robed Han Li laughed, his body transformed into a ball of white light and flew towards the outside, as if trying to escape the sea of consciousness. But the sea of consciousness exerted a pulling force, not letting the white light leave.

Han Li's eyes lit up with joy as he saw this scene. He condensed his energy, raised his hands, and slashed downwards, shouting "Cut!"

A sharp sword shadow appeared in the sea of consciousness, slicing through the air.

With a "ting" sound, the connection between the white light and the sea of consciousness was severed, and the white light flew out.

In the secret room, Han Li's eyes snapped open, and a ball of white light flew out of his body. His body shook violently, and nearly half of his immortal energy and time crystal threads were separated from him, following the white light.

The white light flew out and disappeared into the body of the Earth Immortal puppet inside the formation.

Han Li's face flashed with blood, and his seven apertures burst forth with fresh blood. He couldn't help but let out a stifled groan.

Although the white light had taken away nearly half of his immortal energy and time crystal threads, Han Li's body had suddenly opened up 1,320 immortal apertures, and his cultivation had reached the late stage of the Mahayana realm.

A sound of "hum" echoed through the air, and an invisible force suddenly descended, enveloping Han Li.

The space around him distorted, as if isolating him from the world. His body floated in mid-air, and his head burst forth with a golden light.

A boundless golden ocean appeared above him, and a massive force of time law emanated from it, enveloping his body.

Han Li's face changed color, and he felt a sense of awe as he sensed the will of the heavens within the golden ocean. The force was so powerful that he felt like an insignificant ant, unable to resist.

The aura of the Bone Emperor and the Wheel of Rebirth's master were also extremely powerful, but compared to this golden ocean, they were far inferior.

"Could this golden ocean be the time law of the heavens?" Han Li wondered, his voice trembling.

At this moment, the golden ocean suddenly churned violently, and a golden light shot out, pouring into his body.

The golden light contained an immense force of time law, directly merging with Han Li's body.

Han Li's body glowed with golden light, and his depleted time law force was rapidly restored, reaching its peak in a few breaths.

The time crystal threads also rapidly condensed, and in an instant, they had recovered to 1,800.

The surrounding space continued to distort, and a surge of heavenly energy poured in, merging with Han Li's body.

Han Li's depleted immortal energy was rapidly restored, and in an instant, it had fully recovered.

In the secret room, the purple spirit suddenly opened its eyes, its gaze filled with shock as it looked towards Han Li's closed-off room.
