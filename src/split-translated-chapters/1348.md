Han Li looked at the Black Wind City in front of him, feeling a sense of nostalgia. "Yes, it's been many years since I've returned, and it seems that not much has changed here."

After the Reincarnation Hall invaded the Northern Cold Immortal Domain, the daily life of the city seemed to have been unaffected.

In fact, looking back, the Reincarnation Hall had been secretly developing in the True Immortal Realm for many years, gradually becoming a powerful force that could rival the Heavenly Court. Its relationships with various factions were complex, but for ordinary low- to mid-level cultivators, as well as mortals, it didn't seem to have any significant impact.

If even these people could feel it, it would mean that this force was preparing to emerge from the shadows.

As he thought about it, he brought Nangong Wan into the city, strolling along the streets and gazing at the surroundings. His eyes sparkled with interest.

"Husband, what are you looking at?" Nangong Wan asked curiously.

"I'm currently facing the critical juncture of decapitating the corpse, and I need to focus on my cultivation. I plan to revisit the places I walked through after ascending to the True Immortal Realm, recalling my past experiences and using them to temper my mind," Han Li explained.

Nangong Wan's current cultivation level was insufficient, and she didn't fully understand Han Li's words. However, she trusted him and nodded without saying anything.

Han Li spent two days in Black Wind City with Nangong Wan, recounting his past experiences and associating them with the scenery. Nangong Wan listened with great interest.

After leaving Black Wind City, they crossed the Desolate Wind and arrived at the outskirts of the vast wilderness, continuing to follow Han Li's past trail.

Half a year later, they passed through the ancient land of the Candlesnake Dao.

This place was also where Han Li had formally entered the True Immortal Realm, and he had spent a long time cultivating here. It could be considered his second hometown in the immortal realm.

What surprised him was that the Candlesnake Dao, which had once been renowned in the Northern Cold Immortal Domain, was now deserted, with few people inside, and the disciples were dwindling. There were also signs of battles in various places, and it was no longer as prosperous as it once was.

Han Li used his divine sense to investigate and soon discovered the reason.

The Northern Cold Immortal Domain was a small domain, but the Candlesnake Dao had originally been one of the three major cultivation forces within it, with a relatively deep foundation. However, due to the incident with Baili Yan, the Heavenly Court had attacked, and later, the Ming Han Immortal Palace had suffered heavy losses. The Candlesnake Dao's power had been severely damaged, and it had begun to decline.

Of course, the Cang Liu Palace and the Fu Ling Sect had also been affected in this battle.

Later, when the Gray Boundary invaded the Northern Cold Immortal Domain, the three sects had responded poorly and suffered another heavy blow, resulting in their current downfall.

Han Li sighed inwardly, using his stealth technique to bring Nangong Wan into the Candlesnake Dao. They arrived at the Red Cloud Peak, where he had once resided.

The place had not changed much since his departure, and it seemed to have been abandoned, with no one else living there.

Han Li sat down at the peak, recalling his past experiences in the Candlesnake Dao. He remembered his determination to comprehend the Time Laws, his eagerness to find the Crab Daoist, and his anxiety and fear of the pursuing soldiers.

He stored these emotions in his heart, repeatedly recalling them. The memories from back then became increasingly clear.

His past self was like a mirror, reflecting his true self.

Han Li continued to recall his past experiences, gradually gaining a deeper understanding of his own heart and slowly comprehending what it meant to be himself.

Nangong Wan did not disturb Han Li, silently sitting beside him.

They sat there for half a month, and on the day the sun set, Han Li finally stood up, a faint smile on his lips.

Nangong Wan looked at Han Li, a hint of surprise in her eyes.

Han Li's expression and demeanor seemed to have changed, but she couldn't quite put her finger on what it was.

"It seems that husband's words about cultivating the heart are true, and the cultivation of the Mahayana Realm is indeed profound," Nangong Wan thought to herself.

"Let's go," Han Li said calmly, waving his sleeve and releasing a burst of golden light that enveloped the two of them, breaking through the air and flying away.

...

The Yuanhuang City, located on the outskirts of the Northern Cold Immortal Domain, was like a giant beast lying in wait, blocking everything outside.

Outside the city was a vast desert, with sand dunes stretching as far as the eye could see, a boundless expanse of yellow sand that seemed to stretch on forever.

Han Li and Nangong Wan sat in the void, gazing at the city below and the distant desert.

...

In the wilderness between the Northern Cold Immortal Domain and the Black Mountain Immortal Domain, two figures flew by, their speed varying between slow and fast. They seemed to be appreciating the scenery below.

...

The Floating Cloud Mountain Range in the Black Mountain Immortal Domain, the Wild Crane Valley.

The Black Mountain Immortal Domain was adjacent to the Northern Cold Immortal Domain and had been heavily affected by the Gray Boundary's invasion.

The Wild Crane Valley was now desolate, with no one living there. Mo Wu Xue and Yu Zi Qi, who had chosen to stay behind, were also nowhere to be found.

Han Li and Nangong Wan sat on the stone platform where they had often gathered in the past, sipping fine wine.

...

The Black Earth Immortal Domain, the Illusory Smoke Marsh.

Han Li and Nangong Wan walked through the marsh, surrounded by swirling white mist. However, the mist seemed to be ordinary water vapor, and as soon as it touched them, it automatically parted to either side.

Han Li's eyes sparkled with interest as he gazed at the scenery.
Here is the translated text:

"This is the entrance to the True Speech Sect's ruins, but where's the hallucinatory smoke?" Nangong Wan said.

"That kind of fog only appears at specific times." Han Li said.

His appearance was unchanged from the past, but the aura he emitted had undergone a great transformation, and his expression revealed a sharp, cutting sensation, as if he could sever everything.

A pressure that couldn't be described or explained emanated from Han Li, and all living creatures within a hundred miles around him hid in the swamp, trembling with fear.

"Husband, do you think we can still enter the True Speech Sect's ruins? I'm still very curious about it." Nangong Wan said.

"The True Speech Sect's ruins have been devoured by a spatial rift, and it's probably been completely destroyed. It's unlikely we'll be able to see it again." Han Li shook his head.

"Then where are we going next? Are we going to continue to the Gray Realm? But now that the True Speech Sect's ruins have disappeared, how can we get to the Gray Realm?" Nangong Wan said.

"We're not going to the Gray Realm." Han Li shook his head.

In the past, they had been able to go to the Gray Realm because the Gray Realm had opened a spatial passage connecting it to their location. Now, the passage had been destroyed, and the Gray Realm was in a very distant realm, different from the Demon Realm. Even with Han Li's current cultivation, it wouldn't be easy to get there.

Not only the Gray Realm, but the Demon Realm was also off-limits.

After the defeat of the Crab Daoist, the Demon Realm had fallen into the hands of the Demon Lord. If Han Li were to go there now, he would likely get into big trouble if the Demon Lord were to discover him.

Han Li's expression turned contemplative, and he thought about whether he should try to cut off his own corpse. After these days of reflection and refinement, he had gained a deeper understanding of himself, and he was confident that he could cut off his own corpse.

Just then, a flash of light appeared on the horizon, flying towards them.

Han Li glanced at it, but didn't find it strange.

The Illusory Smoke Swamp was rich in spiritual energy and produced many rare treasures. When the hallucinatory smoke wasn't present, many cultivators would enter the swamp to search for treasures. Han Li had already encountered many people on the road.

Han Li didn't want to meet outsiders, lest it disrupt his contemplative state, and he was about to leave with Nangong Wan.

But then his eyes flashed, and he revealed a surprised expression. He waved his hand, and a beam of golden light shot out, carrying Nangong Wan towards the flash of light.

The cultivator inside the flash of light saw Han Li's majestic aura approaching and was startled, stopping in mid-air. He revealed himself to be an old man in white robes.

The golden light flashed, and Han Li and Nangong Wan appeared.

"Li, is that you!" the old man exclaimed, his face filled with surprise.

"Hello, Hu Yan Daoist, it's been a long time! I didn't expect to meet you again here." Han Li smiled.

This old man was none other than Hu Yan Daoist.

"I also didn't expect to meet you here. Your cultivation has made great progress, I can barely sense it. What realm have you reached?" Hu Yan Daoist asked, sizing Han Li up.

"Over the years, I've experienced many things, and my cultivation has improved somewhat. But Hu Yan Daoist, your cultivation seems to have declined. Have you encountered any problems in your cultivation?" Han Li asked.

Hu Yan Daoist's current cultivation had fallen to the True Immortal Realm, and only mid-stage at that.

"Ha ha, power and wealth are just fleeting clouds, and cultivation is just dust. It's all just trivial matters." Hu Yan Daoist laughed, seemingly unconcerned about his declined cultivation.

"Ah, Hu Yan Daoist, you're still as carefree as ever. I'm inferior to you, and I admire you." Han Li's heart stirred, and he smiled.

Hu Yan Daoist's words were similar to the insights Han Li had gained from his contemplation, and they seemed to be on an even higher level.

"What carefree? I'm just drunk all the time, and my brain is rotten. I don't care about anything." Hu Yan Daoist laughed and scolded himself.

Nangong Wan saw the two of them laughing and chatting, and although she smiled, she was inwardly shocked.

The Han Li she remembered was always very formal and rarely joked with people.

And it was clear that the two of them had a very good relationship.

"Ah, look at me, I'm so caught up in talking to you that I forgot to ask, who is this immortal maiden?" Hu Yan Daoist asked, looking at Nangong Wan and then at Han Li with a meaningful gaze.

"This is Wan'er, my Dao companion. Wan'er, this is Hu Yan Daoist, who helped me a lot in the past." Han Li introduced them.

"Ah, so you're Hu Yan Daoist. I've heard a lot about you. I'm Nangong Wan, and my husband has told me about your kindness to him." Nangong Wan bowed slightly.

"Immortal Maiden Nangong, it's a pleasure to meet you." Hu Yan Daoist winked at Han Li and bowed to Nangong Wan.

"Ah, Hu Yan Daoist, it's been a long time. Shall we find a place to drink some wine together?" Han Li asked with a smile.

"Why find a place? If you two don't mind, why don't you come to my humble abode and stay for a while?" Hu Yan Daoist smiled.

"Sounds good! Let's go to your place and have a cup of wine. I hope your winemaking skills haven't declined over the years." Han Li agreed readily, and Hu Yan Daoist was overjoyed.

"Ha ha, my winemaking skills are still improving every day! Let's go!"

Hu Yan Daoist led them out of the Illusory Smoke Swamp, and they flew towards a mountain range in the distance.
