The black-robed man and woman, although also affected by the evil aura of the evil god, only lagged behind Han Li by a moment before immediately recovering.

However, as soon as they recovered, they exchanged a glance, and a blood-red glow flashed in their eyes as they pretended to still be under control.

Han Li observed their subtle movements, and after a moment of thought, he didn't do anything.

The seven people controlling the formation were controlled by the evil aura, and their hands immediately stopped, the blood-red formation's light dimmed, and the blood-red circles that bound the seven evil gods weakened by nearly half.

The seven great evil gods let out a long, mournful cry, and the blood-red glow on their bodies intensified as they struggled fiercely.

In a series of cracking sounds, the seven blood-red circles suddenly appeared with cracks, and were on the verge of shattering.

At this moment, blue light and golden light flashed on Lan Yu's and Lei Yu's bodies, and their eyes regained their clarity. Seeing this scene, their faces changed.

"Trouble!"

Lan Yu cried out in surprise, but at this moment, the others were still under the control of the evil aura, and the formation beneath them was not something she and Lei Yu could control. They couldn't do anything in time.

Suddenly, a dazzling golden light descended from the sky, and in a flash, it transformed into a circular golden circle that enveloped the seven great evil gods. The golden circle contained countless golden ripples, and the evil gods' struggling bodies immediately froze.

A figure appeared within the golden circle, and it was Han Li.

At the same time, he spread his hands, and five golden lights shot out, each entering the bodies of Xiong Shan and the others.

The five people's bodies immediately radiated dazzling golden light, and a vast, time-based law erupted, instantly crushing and expelling the evil aura within their bodies.

"Quickly!" Han Li shouted.

Lan Yu and the others heard his words and didn't dare to hesitate, immediately using their techniques to activate the formation. The blood-red formation regained its brilliance, and the blood-red circles that bound the seven evil gods also returned to their original state.

Lan Yu opened her mouth and spat out a mouthful of essence blood, which merged with the blood-red token before her.

The token's law-enforcing crystal threads suddenly shone brightly, and more gigantic blood-red symbols appeared, shooting out like a meteor shower, striking the blood-red light screen.

With a loud "boom," the blood-red light screen shook violently, and was ripped apart, transforming into countless blood-red spirit lights that disappeared.

Han Li saw this scene, and his hands changed, the golden light circle around him flashing and disappearing.

The seven evil gods within the circle let out a cry of unwillingness, and their bodies exploded, transforming into a cluster of blood-red lights that dispersed.

"We finally broke through the seal, thanks to your help, Stone friend!" Lan Yu lightly exhaled, standing up and thanking Han Li.

Just as Han Li was about to speak, a shrill, whistling sound erupted.

It was Lei Yu, Wen Zhong, Jin Liu, and Su Qian, who simultaneously shot out like lightning, transforming into two blue and two golden lights, pouncing towards the stone table that had lost its seal and was now completely exposed.

Before they reached the stone table, the four people each waved their hands, releasing a burst of light that transformed into four large, glowing hands, grasping towards the treasures on the stone table.

With a loud "bang," the stone table was shattered, and the treasures on it were scattered, flying out in all directions, but were caught by the four people.

The stone table had nine treasures, and Wen Zhong, Jin Liu, and Su Qian each grabbed two, while Lei Yu, who was the strongest, grabbed three.

The four people's movements were as fast as lightning, and the others didn't react until this moment.

"What are you doing? Didn't we agree to divide these treasures equally before we broke the formation?" Xiong Shan's face darkened, and he asked.

The black-robed man and woman's faces were also unyielding, but they didn't say anything.

Han Li and Lan Yu, as well as Lan Yuanzi, remained silent.

"Divide equally? With your cultivation, you're not worthy of dividing the treasures with us." Jin Liu's hands held the two treasures, the You Shui Xian Lotus and the Tian Jin Drill, and his expression was ecstatic. Hearing Xiong Shan's words, he glanced at him and the black-robed man and woman, and sneered, using a mocking tone.

Xiong Shan's expression suddenly turned ugly, and his hands clenched into fists, but after a moment of silence, he lowered his head, saying nothing.

"Blue friend, Stone friend, you two are different from them. You were able to break through the Seven Kill Blood God Formation, all thanks to your help. Although you two said you didn't want these treasures, the principle of 'those who see it have a share' still applies. Please take these two treasures." Lei Yu and Su Qian exchanged a glance, and each released a burst of light, sending a treasure to Han Li and Lan Yu.

"No need, Stone has already obtained the insect nest, and is already satisfied." Han Li's eyes flashed with a purple light, and he waved his hand, sending the treasure back.

"I, Blue, have already rescued my senior, and am already content." Lan Yu also waved her hand, sending the treasure back.

"If that's the case, then we won't force it. This place seems to have many treasures, and there will certainly be more in the future. We'll compensate you two later." Lei Yu smiled, and was about to put away the treasures in his hands.

But at this moment, a soft "pu" sound came from the treasures in his hands, and the gray-white light on the three treasures flashed, suddenly becoming disordered and unclear, transforming into three gray-white crystal threads.

"This...!" Lei Yu's eyes widened in shock as he stared at the scene.
Three gray-white crystal threads suddenly shot out, pouncing towards Lei Yu Ce who was just a few feet away.

Lei Yu Ce reacted quickly, with a surge of golden light on his body, but it was already too late. The three gray-white crystal threads instantly broke through his protective golden light and entered his body.

Su Xi and the other two people's treasures also turned into a gray-white crystal thread, entering their bodies.

The four of them trembled uncontrollably, half-kneeling on the ground, their mouths emitting painful cries.

Han Li and the others were also shocked, their faces pale.

In the next moment, several people simultaneously flew out in all directions, falling hundreds of feet away, far from the four people, as if avoiding a snake or a scorpion.

Han Li looked more calm than the others, but his eyes flashed with a purple glow.

He hadn't really not cared earlier, but had just used his Nine Yin Magic Eyes to observe those strange treasures, although he hadn't seen that they were illusory objects, he had still sensed something abnormal, so he hadn't taken them.

Lei Yu Ce's cries grew louder, with an increasingly dense gray-white glow on his face, and his pupils rapidly changing to gray-white. His trembling body began to calm down.

"This is terrible, they've been controlled!" Lanyan's face changed, her hands waving towards the four people.

A blue light flew out from her hands, forming a blue silk screen.

The screen was a vibrant blue, seemingly made from a special silk, and it rapidly expanded to several dozen feet in size.

Each blue thread on the screen emitted a blue water ripple glow, and in an instant, tens of thousands of layers of blue water ripples appeared, layer upon layer, surging towards the four people.

But just as the screen was about to cover them, Lei Yu Ce and the others suddenly lifted their heads, their pupils completely changed to gray-white, staring at the falling blue screen.

Su Xi and Jing Liu shouted, their hands waving in unison.

Four blue lights shot out from their hands, forming two blue long lances and two blue large banners.

The four treasures intertwined and rotated, emitting a soaring blue light, forming a massive blue light sphere that held up the falling blue screen.

Meanwhile, Lei Yu Ce and Wen Zhong flew out, pouncing towards Han Li and the others.

Their bodies emitted countless golden sword auras, like blooming flowers, as golden lotus flowers burst forth, covering Han Li and the others.

The fierce sword auras hadn't arrived yet, but the walls and ground nearby, which had been reinforced with restrictions, were already cut with deep and shallow scars, and the air was trembling.

Xiong Shan, the black-clad man and woman, and Lan Yuanzi saw this and hastily used their divine powers to counterattack.

A loud explosion shook the air, as various lights intertwined and flashed.

The four people joined forces, barely withstanding Lei Yu Ce's attack.

But the palace, despite being reinforced with restrictions, couldn't withstand the massive force, and it collapsed, becoming a ruin.

Without the palace's restrictions, the people flew into the air, able to fight more freely, and they clashed again.

Lanyan fought alone against Su Xi and Jing Liu, while Xiong Shan and the others blocked Lei Yu Ce and Wen Zhong.

Lei Yu Ce and the others, controlled by someone, seemed unable to fully exert their strength, but Lanyan and the others, although slightly at a disadvantage, firmly blocked their attacks.

"Who is secretly manipulating others, why not show yourself?" Han Li floated in the air, his eyes flashing with purple light, and he shouted.

"Ah, Nine Yin Magic Eyes, I didn't expect to see the magic of the demon tribe here, it's truly rare. It seems I can add another powerful phantom slave to my collection." A lazy voice came from the nearby void, and the sound echoed, as if many people were speaking at the same time, making it impossible to determine the source.

Han Li couldn't locate the source of the voice, but he could sense that it wasn't Li Qi Ma, and his heart skipped a beat.

Could it be that he had guessed correctly, that there was more than one captive in this layer?

"You have such divine powers, yet you can't show yourself?" Han Li's thoughts turned, and he shouted again.

"Little guy, you think you can deceive me with a few provocative words? Do you think I'm a three-year-old child? If you want to find me, you'll have to use your true abilities, hahaha..." The voice laughed, echoing through the surroundings, striking fear into the hearts of those who heard it.

"Is that so? Then I won't be polite." Han Li listened carefully, a smile spreading across his face, and his hands suddenly reached out into the void.

Two thick, golden electric arcs shot out from his palms, striking a certain point in the void hundreds of feet away.

A deafening thunderclap shook the air, and the void violently fluctuated, as a middle-aged man's figure appeared, his face filled with surprise.

The man wore a cyan long robe, and his features were quite elegant, but his eyes were misty, and his pupils were invisible, emitting a gray-white glow.

At this moment, the golden electric arcs had not dissipated, and they surged towards the middle-aged man.

The man sneered, and with a gentle wave of his sleeve, the golden electric arcs were blocked by an invisible force, unable to advance even a step, before exploding and dispersing.

The man's eyes, however, were still filled with a hint of surprise, and his gaze was fixed on Han Li.
