Gu Qian Xun gazed at Han Li's gradually approaching figure, her complexion changing with a mix of emotions, lost in thought.

"Can you loosen your grip on that thing? Do you really need to be so stubborn and end up like the stone you're holding?" Han Li asked as he glanced at her.

Upon hearing his words, Gu Qian Xun relaxed her body, seemingly recovering some of her energy.

She retrieved a white jade object from her sleeve and inserted it into her clothing, then fell backward, landing seated on the ground. With her hands, she gently pulled her legs out of the ground.

"Why did you save me? We've already become enemies," Gu Qian Xun asked after consuming a beast pill.

"I met Six Flower Lady earlier, and she helped me get rid of the Black Calamity's evil influence. By saving you, I repaid the favor she owed me," Han Li replied slowly, observing that Gu Qian Xun's injuries were severe but not life-threatening.

"You met her? How is she?" Gu Qian Xun inquired hastily.

"She's fine. Earlier, she was taken away by E Mo, possibly to the place where the Sacred Corpse is located," Han Li said calmly.

Gu Qian Xun listened intently and felt somewhat reassured.

"What is your background?" Han Li asked abruptly.

"You should already know, right? Yes, I'm indeed the chess piece Three Prince left in Jilei Space. Back then, if not for his protection, I would have died at the hands of Du Qing Yang along with my mother. As for being able to grow up and eventually avenge my mother's death, it's all thanks to him. So this time, when he ordered me to kill the Eldest Prince and the Thirteenth Prince, I couldn't disobey," Gu Qian Xun replied after a brief hesitation.

Han Li heard this and thought about his past encounters with San Huang Zi Shi Bao Kong. He found that he couldn't pinpoint many flaws, and so he couldn't help but sigh.

Gu Qian Xun assumed Han Li was referring to her, so a bitter smile appeared on her face as she said, "If I had a choice, I really wouldn't want to be your enemy."

"You can go kill the Eldest Prince if you want; I won't stop you and might even lend you a hand when necessary. However, if you harm Shi Chuan Kong again, don't blame me for not showing you mercy and taking your life," Han Li warned, frowning.

Gu Qian Xun listened to his words, her gaze complex, and she remained silent for a long time.

"You should be ready by now, so I'll be taking my leave. Shi Zhan Feng shouldn't be returning anytime soon," Han Li said and jumped over her, disappearing into the distance.

Gu Qian Xun stood motionless, silent for a long time before slowly standing up. She took a few unsteady steps to the side, bent down, and picked up her white bone hook. With a deep breath, she began chasing after Han Li.

Meanwhile, Han Li's figure danced among the ancient structures as he moved swiftly.

Currently, his brow was furrowed, and his emotions were in disarray.

This trip to Jilei Space had taken much longer than he had anticipated. Initially, he thought he would find Zilian quickly and return, but instead, he became embroiled in the intricate conflicts between the two cities, Xuan Qie.

The tricks and schemes between the two cities were already enough to make one's head ache. Now, with the involvement of the Eldest Prince Shi Zhan Feng and San Huang Zi Shi Bao Kong, the situation was becoming increasingly complicated.

Compared to Shi Zhan Feng's personal adventures, Han Li was more concerned about Shi Bao Kong's hidden machinations, as evidenced by Gu Qian Xun's circumstances. It was clear that Shi Bao Kong had been secretly operating in Jilei Space for quite some time.

Why were both parties so interested in this desolate place, Jilei Space? Logically, the reason should be connected to the Sacred Corpse in the ancient city.

This line of thinking made Han Li's heart tighten slightly. Was it possible that Shi Chuan Kong was also searching for this?

"Rather than pondering this, I should think about the enigma of Xi Dao Ren," Han Li said to himself with a hint of self-deprecation.

Ever since he entered Jilei Space, he noticed that his connection with Xi Dao Ren seemed to be growing weaker, not in the sense that their divine soul bond was severed, but rather that he felt an increasing sense of separation from him.

As he pondered the contents recorded on the jade slate Xi Dao Ren gave him, Han Li grew more curious about Xi Dao Ren's true intentions.

He even wondered if Xi Dao Ren's 'Master' was the Sacred Corpse or the previous master of the ancient city, considering the jade slate contained information on the locations and acquisition methods of the hollowed spheres.

At the moment, he was tracing the path outlined in the jade slate. After traveling several hundred miles, vast areas of damaged and dilapidated ruins came into view. The traces were relatively new, covering an extensive range, likely left behind by the previous confrontation between E Mo and Sha Xin.

Han Li occasionally stopped to investigate and would then continue his pursuit.

Time flew, and over half a month passed.

Eventually, after relentless searching, Han Li arrived at a vast expanse of white stone square.

The square was surrounded by four nine-story sharp towers, each standing in the four corners.
In the center of the square stood a magnificent temple with a jade-glazed tile roof, its grandeur far surpassing that of any building Han Li had seen in the town before. Unlike the ruins and wreckage he had seen along the way, this temple, though ancient, was remarkably well preserved. The glazed tiles on the roof and the pillars surrounding the temple shone like new, without a single sign of wear.

Han Li gazed at the temple from afar, noticing the two massive doors at the entrance, adorned with intricate carvings and hanging open. Above the entrance, a golden signboard bore three ancient characters.

"The Thousand Mechanism Temple..." Han Li whispered to himself, suddenly recalling that Shi Zhanfeng had mentioned this name before.

As he thought about it, Han Li furrowed his brow, suppressed the fluctuations in his aura, and flew towards the temple.

Upon approaching the temple, Han Li noticed that the stone bricks on the ground were covered with starlight symbols, stretching for thousands of feet around the temple. This was clearly a complex array.

As he reached the corridor outside the temple, the symbol pattern changed again, revealing another array.

Near the entrance, Han Li saw scorch marks on the open doors, indicating that the original seals had been broken.

Instead of rushing in, Han Li carefully peered inside.

The interior of the temple was in disarray, with stone pedestals and furniture overturned and shattered. It was evident that a fierce battle had recently taken place within.

Han Li held his breath, listening for a moment, and discovered that the temple was deathly silent.

With a swift movement, he entered the temple.

Inside, the temple was empty, devoid of any human figures or signs of Sha Xin's group. Only scattered fragments of furniture and towering bone armored puppets lay about.

Han Li's brow furrowed as he cautiously explored the temple.

After a thorough examination, he found that the bone puppets seemed to be of the same origin as those he had seen in other ruins, rather than being controlled by the puppet city.

Just then, Han Li spotted a small, unassuming black stone chair amidst the wreckage. He approached it, circling around it once, a hint of a smile on his lips.

Seizing the chair's backrest with both hands, Han Li suddenly twisted it to one side.

A faint scraping sound was followed by the appearance of a small, dark passageway next to the chair.

After a brief hesitation, Han Li stepped into the passageway and descended the stone stairs within.

A hundred feet down, the stairs ended, and a doorway appeared. A faint breeze and muffled voices could be heard from within.

Han Li slowed his pace, trying not to make a sound, and then activated his Feathered Wings technique, swiftly entering the doorway.

Upon entering, Han Li relaxed, seeing no one lying in wait.

He hid behind a boulder and carefully observed his surroundings.

Before him lay a massive blood lake, its surface spanning thousands of feet. It was filled with crimson liquid, gently rippling like water.

A layer of bloody mist hung above the lake, radiating a faint, flickering glow.

As Han Li scanned the lake, his gaze suddenly locked onto something in the center—a crystal coffin floating on the surface.

The coffin was wide at the top and narrow at the bottom, about ten feet in size, with a flawless, crystal-clear body. A complex symbol pattern adorned its surface, including a five-pointed star diagram surrounded by at least five additional arrays. Han Li realized that the core symbol was a five-pointed star, though it was intricate and masterfully crafted.

Within the coffin lay a ten-foot-long, skeleton-like corpse with a jade-like luster. Its head had sharp bones, pointed teeth, and what appeared to be scaly patterns on its bones, marking it as a demon corpse.

Just then, Han Li felt a sudden, faint tremor in his mind, as if sensing a familiar aura—possibly that of the crab-like immortal, yet his location remained elusive.

With a thought, Han Li closed his eyes and focused on sensing the aura.

Opening his eyes shortly after, Han Li's face revealed a look of surprise.

He had discovered that his spiritual connection with the crab-like immortal was growing weaker by the second.

"You traitor, will you continue to be stubborn?" A furious shout echoed from across the blood lake.

Han Li refocused, gazing towards the voice and spotted a confrontation unfolding on the other side of the lake. The puppets and the other group, led by Sha Xin, were facing off against E Mei.

Six Flower Mistress stood behind E Mei, while Shi Chong Kong lay at her feet, either unconscious or bound by E Mei's restraints.
