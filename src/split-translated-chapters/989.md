In the underground palace, as Crab Daoist's figure disappeared, the dazzling golden light that filled the entire palace also disappeared without a trace.

Han Li felt the flow of the fairy spirit power in his elixir field become sluggish again, but it did not completely solidify, because the omnipresent sense of oppression from before was no longer present.

After he settled his mind, he used his divine sense to locate Crab Daoist's position, barely mobilized his fairy spirit power to perform the escape technique, and in the next moment appeared on the ground, continuing to bathe in the golden light, and the fairy spirit power restored its agility again.

At this moment, Crab Daoist was standing with his hands hanging at his sides, looking up at the sky, his eyes revealing some excitement and some expectation.

Han Li was puzzled in his heart and also looked up at the sky.

At this moment, the originally bright sky suddenly became gloomy, and the originally dense yellow clouds also turned into a gray-black color at a speed visible to the naked eye, revealing an extremely heavy pressure.

This pressure was as high as the heavens and as heavy as the earth, vast and mighty, and unstoppable.

Han Li's body, suspended in mid-air, suddenly became heavy, as if being pressed by a giant peak. With a "plop" sound, he fell from mid-air directly to the ground.

"This is the aura of a great calamity of heaven and earth!"

Han Li's heart suddenly moved, and his expression changed.

The upcoming great calamity aura was so strong that it was many times more powerful than any thunder calamity he had experienced before. Even the slight signs revealed just now were already impossible for him to resist.

Black One and Black Two were originally standing on the ground and received much less impact than Han Li, but at this time their legs were trembling uncontrollably and their faces were pale.

"You guys stay away, this is not something you can bear." Crab Daoist's powerful voice came down from mid-air.

Black One and Black Two heard the words and dared not slack off. They hurriedly flew towards the distance.

Han Li didn't wait for Crab Daoist to speak. With a flash of golden lightning on his body surface, he disappeared without a trace. In the next moment, he appeared in the air hundreds of miles away, looking back in the direction where Crab Daoist was.

The golden light on Crab Daoist's body could no longer shine here, but he only glanced back, and without saying a word, he turned around and continued to shoot towards the distance with all his strength. In the blink of an eye, he advanced hundreds of miles again.

But within a thousand miles, the sky was still dark, and in the rolling of wind and clouds, it quickly spread in all directions, obviously he was still within the range of the great calamity.

The sky above his head looked even more gloomy, almost turning pitch black, reflecting the ground below into a black mass, and the silence revealed a sense of murderousness.

Han Li was shocked in his heart and hurriedly sped up his escape from the center position again.

But at this moment, the sky suddenly rang out with a slight "hiss hiss" sound. The dark clouds in the sky suddenly rolled violently towards a certain direction, continuing to gather towards the center, forming an incomparably huge vortex, covering an unknown range.

Bolts of black lightning appeared in various places of the vortex, traveling like fireworks, illuminating the ground below.

And soon, a black hole appeared in the center of the vortex, emitting a deep light, as if connected to an unknown place.

Boom!

An aura of terror, many times more vast than before, emanated from the vortex, and the surrounding void shook violently, distorting completely.

Han Li had nowhere to avoid and was directly pressed down by this huge aura.

Buzz!

His mind spun, and even though he had opened nearly nine hundred profound orifices at this moment, he was still an ant in the face of this great force. His vision went black and he fainted.

However, before he fainted, Han Li saw with the corner of his eye a grey cloud fly out from the center of the huge vortex and cover Crab Daoist.

The grey cloud looked ordinary, but it emitted a terrible aura of destroying everything. He was hit by this aura of destruction, which caused him to fall into a coma.

...

In the Demon Domain, within a pitch-black palace in Night Sun City.

The Demon Lord's body was enveloped by a soft silver light, forming a huge silver ball of light, slowly rotating.

The surrounding void rippled with the rotation of the light ball, visible to the naked eye.

"Eh!"

He suddenly opened his eyes, the silver light on his body surface instantly disappeared, and he looked towards the void outside.

"This is coming from the Jilei Empty Realm, could it be..." The Demon Lord's face flashed with a coldness, and he slowly stood up.

...

In the Luoheng Mansion.

Third Prince Shi Pukong stood outside a large hall, looking towards the distant horizon, his face filled with an uncertain expression.

...

In a certain dark void, a slight 'eh' sound suddenly rang out. In the darkness, a black figure could vaguely be seen.

"Unexpectedly, it was accomplished so quickly? It's getting lively now." The black figure smiled, and with a flicker, he disappeared into thin air.
Han Li found himself trapped in a terrifying nightmare. His body felt as if it was submerged at the bottom of a ten thousand zhang deep icy cold lake, completely unable to move. Moreover, there were strands of cold power as fine as dust, like small fish invading every part of his body, causing immense pain.

After an unknown period of time, the cold power gradually disappeared, and then a vast warm current entered his body, extremely comfortable.

Han Li slowly woke up and found himself lying on the ground.

The sky above his head had turned purple, and there was a soft and warm aura in the air.

He suddenly remembered something and looked towards the direction of the Thousand Machines Hall.

He saw the Crab Daoist still standing in midair, his whole body charred black, with huge scars appearing on it. He looked like a piece of broken wood after being struck by lightning and scorched by fire.

But above him, in the center of the vortex, a mass of purple auspicious clouds gradually emerged and descended, enveloping the Crab Daoist's body and rapidly permeating into it.

The Crab Daoist's battered body absorbed the purple auspicious clouds and immediately recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye, healing completely in the blink of an eye.

All the purple light in midair rapidly condensed into a purple rainbow.

A thick crystal light also rose from the Crab Daoist's body and merged with the purple rainbow.

With a "boom", the purple rainbow suddenly expanded several times in size and turned into a purple dragon, circling and dancing around the Crab Daoist's body.

Within the purple auspicious light, countless crystal threads could be seen, densely packed and emitting vast law fluctuations as the light flashed.

Han Li was enveloped by this law fluctuation, and his body involuntarily moved, as if he were a puppet being pulled by strings.

The nearby void and ground were the same, automatically trembling non-stop.

Fortunately, after the purple dragon circled and danced for a while, it quickly disappeared into the Crab Daoist's mind, and the vast law fluctuation disappeared without a trace.

The Crab Daoist's body was enveloped in purple auspicious light, his eyes tightly closed, as if sensing the changes inside his body.

After a while, the light on his body flashed, and all the purple light disappeared, revealing his figure.

At this moment, the Crab Daoist was wearing a light purple robe and straw sandals, seemingly unchanged, but the power that could shake the world surrounded him with every move.

But in the next moment, with a slight movement of his eyebrows, the power on his body immediately disappeared.

In a flash, all the strange changes in the sky also disappeared, and the nearby sky returned to its previous appearance, and the terrifying pressure emanating from the sky also dissipated.

Han Li felt his body lighten, and he slowly stood up, though he still felt a bit heavy-headed and light-footed.

Hei Da and Hei Er were lying on the ground over a hundred miles away from him. The two seemed to have been injured much more severely than Han Li, and were still unconscious at the moment, but fortunately they had escaped in time and should not be in any life-threatening danger.

The Crab Daoist turned his head and looked in Han Li's direction, and with a movement of his feet, he disappeared into thin air and appeared beside Han Li.

"Crab Fellow Daoist, you..." Han Li looked at the Crab Daoist with a surprised expression.

"I didn't expect the Dao Heavenly Tribulation to be so vast and to come so quickly, so I didn't have time to let you leave earlier, causing you to be affected by the great tribulation." The Crab Daoist said.

As they spoke, he waved his hand.

Han Li felt a warm current enter his mind, and his spirit immediately shook, and the heavy-headed and light-footed feeling immediately disappeared.

In the distance, Hei Da and Hei Er's bodies also stirred, and although they were still unconscious, their injuries were gradually recovering.

"Dao Heavenly Tribulation... Don't tell me you have already reached the Dao Ancestor realm?" Han Li couldn't care less about his physical condition and stared at the Crab Daoist with wide eyes.

"After countless years of bitter cultivation, going through many ups and downs, and the separation and reunion of body and mind, today I have finally attained the Great Dao by luck." The Crab Daoist said with a smile.

"That's really congratulations to you." Although Han Li had guessed it earlier, he still let out a light breath when he heard this, and then congratulated him.

"The success I have today is also thanks to the help of Fellow Daoist Han, so I thank you here." The Crab Daoist bowed slightly.

"I dare not, since you have attained the position of Dao Ancestor, I am ashamed to accept the title of Fellow Daoist. Just call me Han Li." Han Li hastily said.

"Fellow Daoist Han, you and I have been friends for many years, and I also know that you are a free and easy person, so why bother with these worldly etiquettes? Just call me Crab Fellow Daoist, I still like this title." The Crab Daoist waved his hand.

"Since that's the case, then I will shamelessly call you Fellow Daoist. By the way, Crab Fellow Daoist, did you just say your surname is Shi?" Han Li also smiled, then asked.

"Yes. My original name is Shi Kongjie, I didn't mean to hide it from you, it's just that I hadn't remembered it before, and after entering the Jilei Void Boundary, many things happened, so I didn't have time to tell you." The Crab Daoist nodded and said.

"Shi Kongjie... Could it be that Fellow Daoist Shi has some relationship with the Night Sun Dynasty?" Han Li hesitated for a moment, but still asked.

The Crab Daoist looked up at the sky and did not answer Han Li's question for a moment.

"If Fellow Daoist Shi has any secrets that are difficult to tell, then just pretend I didn't ask." Han Li glanced at the Crab Daoist's expression and said.

Now that the Crab Daoist had reached the Dao Ancestor level, he couldn't help but feel awe in his heart and spoke very cautiously.

"Fellow Daoist Han is overthinking, there are no secrets that are difficult to tell, it's just that returning to the Sacred Domain this time, I feel a bit emotional. Fellow Daoist Han, you have protected me all the way here, so emotionally and logically, I should inform you of these matters. Moreover, I have something to ask of you, so you must know these things." The Crab Daoist smiled faintly and said meaningfully.

"You have something to ask of me? I wonder what it is, but please feel free to tell me." Han Li was shocked when he heard this, and said so.
