Outside the Heaven's Gate, Han Li let out a miserable cry, his entire body flying backward and heavily colliding with the Heaven's Gate before crashing down.

His hands, which were grasping the sword, had already lost all their flesh and blood, transforming into a pair of white, bony claws that looked extremely terrifying.

On the other side, Yue Qing's arms sank, and he withdrew the massive sword.

The seven mountain symbols on the sword's body had five of them become blurry and unclear, leaving only two intact.

"With the Heaven-Piercing Sword Array in your hands, you're able to unleash such power, I must say I'm impressed," Yue Qing's eyebrows furrowed, his gaze on Han Li no longer held the previous scorn, but instead, a hint of admiration.

"This sword array is the pinnacle of the world, and I've only unleashed a fraction of its power. If I had unleashed more, you wouldn't be standing there, speaking such words of praise," Han Li spat out a mouthful of blood, struggling to stand up.

White smoke emerged from his bony hands, and his flesh began to regenerate.

Yue Qing heard this and didn't immediately attack, instead, he looked at Han Li with a strange expression, seemingly surprised that Han Li would say such a thing.

"It's not that I'm boasting, but if you had been controlled for a bit longer, allowing me to gather more power, that previous strike would have been unstoppable," Han Li swung his hand, putting away the exhausted Qingtian Bee Cloud Sword, saying it in a seemingly casual tone.

The golden thunderclouds and the majestic golden Heaven's Gate in the sky dissipated along with it.

"Ha ha, I was just praising you, but you're boasting instead. That previous sword strike should have been your trump card, yet you still refuse to surrender. What are you waiting for?" Yue Qing sneered, saying.

Han Li looked at his restored hands, a smile appearing on his face, "That's not necessarily true, I still have one more sword. I wonder if you dare to receive it?"

Yue Qing heard this and furrowed his eyebrows, about to speak, but his expression suddenly changed, his gaze shifting to the surroundings.

Han Li's spiritual domain still hadn't dissipated, and the silver moon remained suspended above him, the time law fluctuations in the surrounding void still clear.

"I didn't expect your half-baked Heaven Person realm spiritual domain to have such troublesome power. However, this slight increase in power is nothing to me. Even if my cultivation were to regress by a hundred million years, you would still not be my match," Yue Qing's gaze condensed, his voice cold.

"Ultimately, you've discovered it, I had hoped to delay for a bit longer, but it seems that's not possible," Han Li sighed, saying.

"Enough, no more idle chatter. If you don't surrender, I'll no longer hold back, and your life will be forfeit," Yue Qing had indeed not intended to kill Han Li earlier, but rather, he wanted to capture him alive.

"I'd like to see you receive one more sword strike before I surrender," Han Li's mouth curled into a smile, saying.

As he spoke, the ruined Jade Vase Peak below suddenly lit up with a golden glow, thirty-six golden lightning columns shot up, and a new thundercloud formed, the majestic Heaven's Gate reappearing.

Yue Qing saw this and a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes.

Han Li had left behind thirty-six Qingtian Bee Cloud Swords in the ruins of Jade Vase Peak when he was first struck down by Yue Qing, and he had set up a second Heaven-Piercing Sword Array using another thirty-six flying swords.

He had originally planned to activate the second sword array immediately after the first one's power was exhausted, catching Yue Qing off guard and heavily injuring him. However, Yue Qing's power was too great, and his powerful counterattack had caused Han Li to miss the opportunity.

Just now, after his hands had recovered, Han Li had secretly activated the second sword array.

Han Li stood outside the golden Heaven's Gate, his hands clasped together, raised above his head.

The Heaven's Gate behind him let out a thunderous roar, slowly opening inward, and the golden thunder sea above began to release golden lightning balls that flew towards Han Li's palms.

Seeing Han Li reuse his old trick, Yue Qing's face darkened, a hint of anger flashing in his eyes.

Although he had spoken lightly earlier, Yue Qing was indeed concerned about Han Li's Heaven-Piercing Sword Array. After all, judging from the previous sword strike, if Han Li's body could withstand it, and he was allowed to continue absorbing the lightning power from the thunder sea, he would indeed be able to threaten Yue Qing.

Now, he wouldn't give Han Li that chance.

"You refuse to accept my offer, so you'll have to accept the punishment."

Yue Qing snorted, his hands gripping the massive sword, his feet stepping on the void, his body suddenly shooting out, charging towards Han Li.

Han Li's eyes flashed, his mind moving.

The void responded with a series of "隆隆" sounds, as golden fireballs descended from the nine heavens, like a meteor shower, pouring down on Yue Qing.

A loud crash echoed.

Yue Qing swung his sword, splitting a fireball in two, but immediately, a third and fourth fireball descended.

The fireballs' power was limited, almost unable to withstand Yue Qing's single sword strike, but their numbers were vast, each carrying the Years God Lamp's fierce flames and the Time Severing Fire's time law fluctuations.

After cutting down dozens of fireballs, Yue Qing suddenly found his sword speed slowing down, as if he was once again bound by the True Speech Treasure Wheel.
He didn't know that the sparks from the shattered Flowing Flame had fallen onto his body, imbuing him with the power of the Time Law, which had accumulated to a certain extent, causing his movements to slow down.

Han Li's hands were already radiating dazzling golden light, and his eyes were surrounded by electric threads. His entire body was covered in sparks of electricity.

But he knew that this power was still far from enough.

Han Li's thoughts stirred, and the Golden Heavenly Gate behind him opened another fraction, releasing a surge of golden lightning from within. The golden lightning balls flew out, condensing into his palm.

"Ah..."

He let out a pained cry, and his eyelids and ears began to crack open, revealing a network of bloody cracks. Golden electric light could be seen emanating from within.

Gold Boy and Xiao Bai turned to look at him, shocked.

"Uncle, you can't keep going on like this, your body can't take it..." Gold Boy shouted.

Xiao Bai didn't have time to say anything before being suppressed by Po Feng again.

Wu Hui, who had been suppressed by Gold Boy, let out a laugh and attacked Gold Boy again.

"Not enough, I need more..." Han Li gritted his teeth, his mind roaring with madness.

A thousand feet away, Yue Qing's speed had slowed, but he was still closing in on Han Li. He noticed that Han Li's body was already accumulating a massive amount of lightning power.

"Enough, boy, it's time to stop." Yue Qing suddenly stopped his advance, his voice booming with a killing intent.

As he spoke, he raised his hand, and a massive grey mountain peak appeared in the air, blocking the falling Flowing Flame.

At the same time, his sword flashed, and a wave of yellow energy shot out, creating a ripple effect that distorted the air.

The sword's energy was so powerful that it created a visible distortion in the air, causing the space around Han Li to ripple and distort.

Han Li's accumulated lightning power was still not enough, and he could only smile wryly and prepare to change his stance.

Just as he was about to do so, a golden talisman shot out from the distance, colliding with Yue Qing's sword energy and causing a massive explosion.

A blast of golden light erupted, releasing a powerful and savage energy that shattered Yue Qing's sword energy and pushed him back.

The shockwave from the explosion destroyed the surrounding landscape, including the Jade Vase Peak, leaving behind a desolate wasteland.

"You're indeed a true spirit of the Barbarian Realm!" Yue Qing exclaimed, his eyes fixed on Xiao Bai.

Xiao Bai didn't respond, but his heart was filled with disappointment.

The golden talisman that White Ze had given him, which contained 30% of his power, had failed to harm Yue Qing.

On the other hand, Po Feng was shocked by the explosion and realized that if the talisman had been used on her, she would have been killed instantly.

Han Li, who had been caught off guard by the explosion, stumbled backward, his face and arms covered in cracks. Golden electricity could be seen flowing through his body.

However, his hands remained in their original position, still holding the Heavenly Sword Array.

His eyes were blurry, and his mind was in a state of confusion.

"You can't hold on, can you? Release me, and I'll help you kill him. Hehe..." a sinister voice whispered in his mind.

Han Li knew it was the Evil Corpse speaking, but he didn't respond.

His body was numb, and the golden lightning from the Heavenly Gate was spreading throughout his body, threatening to explode at any moment.

Yue Qing noticed Han Li's state and sneered, deciding to wait for him to self-destruct rather than attacking him directly.

Han Li's body was on the verge of collapse, and his lightning power was on the brink of exploding. If he continued, his body would be torn apart by the golden lightning.

Yue Qing seemed to be waiting for Han Li to explode, his eyes fixed on him with a cold smile.
