Lan Yan stood beside Han Li, gazing at the surrounding void that had become stagnant, and his heart was shocked to the core.

But Han Li's brow was furrowed, and he raised his hand to strike out with a sword.

A loud explosion echoed.

A golden lightning pillar erupted, blasting open a massive passageway several dozen feet in diameter directly through the imprisoned ghostly creatures.

Through the empty passageway, Han Li could see the massive ghostly face that had appeared on the wall.

Earlier, he hadn't gotten a clear look, but now he realized that this ghostly face was different.

Its facial features resembled those of the human race, but its mouth was open to an exaggerated degree, making the entire face seem scrunched up, and it looked somewhat like a demonic beast.

On top of its head, it wore a strange crown, with what seemed to be jade and pearls hanging from the front and back, resembling the imperial crown of a worldly dynasty, and it exuded a sense of solemn dignity.

Its blood-red mouth revealed two rows of sharp, white teeth, with two pairs of sharp canine teeth on top and bottom.

Between the canine teeth, a faint golden glow could be seen.

Han Li's heart was slightly surprised, and his gaze condensed as he realized that the golden glow was actually a small, golden sword, still radiating golden lightning, and it was his own Qing Zhu Bao Yun sword.

His thoughts stirred, and he took a step forward, his body flashing rapidly as he charged through the empty passageway towards the massive ghostly face.

"Hehe, I've been waiting for you." A voice that sent shivers down one's spine echoed from outside the formation.

The ghostly creature's two arms suddenly stretched out, and its hands quickly formed a seal, striking towards the formation.

In an instant, all the ghostly creatures that had been trapped by Han Li's spiritual domain began to move.

The ghostly creatures surrounding the passageway immediately surged towards the center, and Han Li found himself surrounded by a tide of ghosts.

"Get out of my way!" Han Li's voice boomed, and the long sword in his hand spun like a windmill, releasing a series of golden lightning bolts that struck the approaching ghostly creatures, but they were unable to block him.

Just as he was about to break through the ghostly tide, the ghostly creatures in front of him suddenly dispersed.

Han Li's heart cried out in alarm, but it was too late.

A scarlet tongue burst out from the scattered ghostly creatures, shooting towards him.

Han Li reacted quickly, and his body halted as he struck out with his sword, a golden lightning bolt condensing onto the tip of his sword and shooting towards the tongue.

However, the next instant, a shocking scene unfolded.

The scarlet tongue had a golden lightning pattern on its surface, and a massive lightning bolt erupted from it, colliding with Han Li's sword and shattering it, striking his body.

Han Li's body felt numb, and his spiritual energy's circulation was disrupted, and his charging body was forced to stop.

"What is this?" he wondered in shock.

The tongue had released his own Bi Xie Shen Lei, although its power was not as great as the original, it was still terrifying.

Before he could think it through, the scarlet tongue struck out again, this time without releasing lightning, and instead, it coiled around his body.

Han Li's foot tapped the ground, and he violently retreated, but he was immediately surrounded by a circle of ghostly creatures.

Although they were not powerful, their numbers were too great, and even with Han Li's golden lightning protection, he was still somewhat overwhelmed.

He hesitated for a moment, and then his palm swept downward, conjuring a silver light gate in front of him.

The ghostly creatures surrounding him paused, and then they charged towards the light gate like madmen, instantly filling it.

"The treasure of the Cave Heaven, you little scamp, you actually have such a treasure, haha... my little ghosts will go and occupy it first, and then I'll take it for myself." The ghostly creature's eyes widened in surprise.

However, before he could finish speaking, the ghostly creatures that had entered the light gate were like living people who had seen a ghost, and they frantically escaped from the gate.

The silver light gate was narrow, and it was difficult to enter or exit, and the ghostly creatures were stuck, unable to move, and their cries and wails echoed from within the gate.

But after a while, the cries and wails gradually subsided, and the ghostly creatures that had been stuck at the gate dispersed, forming a fan-shaped empty space outside the gate, and they stared at the gate with fear, unwilling to approach.

At this moment, a figure flashed out of the light gate, and a pale-faced girl in a green dress walked out.

"What is this?" the ghostly creature's brow furrowed in surprise.

"Hmph."

The girl let out a belch, and then she looked at Han Li with a somewhat embarrassed expression.

"Ti Hu, this guy cultivates the ghost path, but it's a bit strange, I was going to wait until I figured it out before calling you out, but now I don't have time to think about it." Han Li's face flashed with a smile.

"Leave it to me." Ti Hu smiled and said.
As she finished speaking, her gaze swept towards the countless ghostly creatures in front of her, her icy stare scanning them as if taking stock of her provisions.

A loud roar erupted from her, and her body began to glow with a black aura. Her eyes turned a deep red, and her body rapidly expanded, transforming into a massive black ape over a hundred meters tall.

Its body was covered in dark, steel-like fur, and its head was adorned with sharp horns and teeth. A third eye glowed with a malevolent red light on its forehead, and three black bone spines protruded from its back, exuding a chilling aura.

As the ape's roar echoed through the air, the ghostly creatures trembled with fear, retreating in disarray.

"Crimson Beast, it's actually a Crimson Beast..." Ghost Spirit's expression changed, and he exclaimed in a mixture of shock and awe.

His voice was laced with urgency, and his eyes were wide with excitement, making it difficult to discern whether he was thrilled or terrified.

Lan Yan, who was watching from a distance, was shocked by the transformation, having only seen the Crimson Beast's human form before. The sight of its true form was both terrifying and awe-inspiring.

The Crimson Beast, now in its true form, didn't hesitate to attack. Its nose twitched, and a wave of crimson light shot out, dispersing the ghostly creatures and absorbing them into its belly.

The chamber was filled with the wails of the ghostly creatures, and the air was thick with the stench of death.

Ghost Spirit's eyes gleamed with a sinister light, and he smiled, his eyebrows arched upwards.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat, and he felt a sense of unease. He immediately sent a message to the Crimson Beast, "I feel like something's off, be careful."

Before the Crimson Beast could respond, Ghost Spirit vanished into a cloud of ghostly energy.

Han Li's senses went on high alert, and he felt a growing sense of unease.

The chamber began to shake violently, and a wave of crimson light burst forth from the ground, illuminating the surroundings.

Han Li looked around, only to find that the chamber had changed, and they were now in a different space.

The Crimson Beast let out a soft snort, and the ghostly creatures that had been its prey disappeared.

This new space was devoid of any landmarks, and the only feature was a blood-red haze that filled the air.

Lan Yan rushed to Han Li's side, her expression panicked. "According to legend, Ghost Spirit's sacred envoy is skilled in the art of spirit realm cultivation, having reached the realm of the gods. This place is likely his spirit realm space, known as the 'Ghost Lair'."

A voice boomed from the shadows, "You think you can just waltz in here and take what's mine? I'll take you down first!"

Han Li's eyes scanned the surroundings, but he couldn't find any sign of Ghost Spirit.

Just as he was about to warn Lan Yan, he grabbed her shoulder and pulled her towards him.

A blood-red vortex erupted from the ground where Lan Yan had been standing, and a horde of ghostly arms reached out, grasping for the air.

Han Li drew his sword, and a bolt of golden lightning shot out, striking the vortex and dispelling it.

As the vortex dissipated, a dark shadow loomed above them, and a massive figure stood towering over them.

The figure wore a black robe with dragon and phoenix embroidery, and its face was twisted into a grotesque grimace. It wore a crown with a curtain of pearls, and its eyes gleamed with an otherworldly energy.

Han Li realized that this was the same figure he had seen in the Heavenly Spirit Array.

The figure held a thick, black book in one hand and a crimson brush in the other, giving off an aura of a judge or an executioner.

Han Li saw that the figure's boots were adorned with a ring of symbols, which seemed to be part of a magical array.

"This guy is probably a Domain Spirit," Han Li thought to himself, his body already moving to avoid the figure's attack.

The Crimson Beast, despite its smaller size, showed no fear, its bone spines glowing with a fierce light as it charged towards the figure.

Han Li shouted a warning, but it was too late. The Crimson Beast's spines struck the figure's boots, triggering the magical array.

A wave of crimson light erupted, forming a barrier that pinned the Crimson Beast to the ground.

Han Li rushed to its aid, but the figure's head twisted in an unnatural angle, its mouth opening wide to reveal a blood-red tongue that shot towards him like a snake.

The air was filled with the stench of death, and Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he realized the gravity of the situation.
