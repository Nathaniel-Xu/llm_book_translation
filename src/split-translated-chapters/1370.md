The Heavenly Demon's magical laws were mysterious and unpredictable, exceling at deluding the minds of others. It was best to have me and Brother Jin handle this, while you, He Lan, and Turtle Spirit Dao Friend deal with Chen Ruyan. The desiccated corpse-like man from the Demon Realm's four ancestors spoke to the demonic and charming woman and the white-robed, plump woman.

Chen Ruyan was renowned for being the most beautiful and strongest woman in the Heavenly Court. Today, I'll finally get to experience her prowess. The demonic and charming woman gazed at Chen Ruyan, her eyes flashing with a fierce light, and waved her hand.

Hundreds of purple-black light rays shot out from her body, each one rapidly expanding into massive, tree-like purple-black vines. The tips of the vines burst forth with enormous, house-sized purple-black flowers that seemed breathtakingly beautiful.

However, the petals of these flowers were covered in sharp, thorn-like protrusions, and they seemed to be writhing like living creatures, causing one's skin to crawl.

The demonic and charming woman pointed forward, and hundreds of purple-black demon flowers shot out, bursting forth like a demonic python and charging towards Chen Ruyan's Blue Dragon Array.

The moment they made contact, a deafening explosion shook the heavens, and blue and purple lights clashed, sending shockwaves through the gray, misty void.

The white-robed, plump woman gazed at Yin Ming Dao Zu, her eyes flashing with a hint of resentment, but she also understood that she was no match for his Heavenly Demon magical laws.

She let out a cold snort, and her plump body rolled on the ground, instantly conjuring a massive, hundred-mile-wide black storm. Countless black wind columns shot out from the storm, dancing and waving towards all directions.

Accompanied by a low, rumbling roar, a massive, black, obese beast emerged from the black storm. The beast had the head of a lion, nine blood-red eyes, and a body resembling a lizard, with two enormous, fleshy wings sprouting from its back, lined with razor-sharp claws and surrounded by black energy currents.

The black beast flapped its wings, causing the black storm to surge forward, charging towards Chen Ruyan and crashing into the Blue Dragon Array, unleashing a series of deafening explosions.

The four of them flew extremely high, almost reaching the boundary of the heavenly realm, and did not affect the armies below.

The desiccated corpse-like man and the yellow-robed man, who was filled with an aura of death, also flew out, charging towards Yin Ming Dao Zu.

The desiccated corpse-like man muttered to himself, his body rapidly expanding to a size of ten thousand feet, and his withered, corpse-like body began to transform. His skin turned a dry, yellowish color, and his bones became visible, resembling a zombie's corpse.

Countless, liquid-like yellow energy currents surged out from his body, emitting a putrid stench that seemed to be a mixture of rotting flesh and death, making one's stomach churn.

The desiccated corpse-like man grasped at the air with his hands, and ten dry, yellow claws shot out from his palms, tearing apart the surrounding black demonic shadows.

The desiccated corpse-like man didn't seem to be under the control of the Heavenly Demon, and his body merely swayed slightly before stabilizing, continuing to charge towards Yin Ming Dao Zu.

However, the yellow-robed man was even faster, drawing out his long sword in a flash. The sword's blade was a grayish-white color, and he stabbed it forward.

Yin Ming Dao Zu's body seemed to shift, and a thousand-foot-long, grayish-white sword ray suddenly appeared, stabbing towards his head.

The sword's energy was incredibly ferocious, and it seemed to be imbued with an aura of death, causing the surrounding air to distort and turn gray.

Yin Ming Dao Zu's brow furrowed, seemingly wary of the sword's energy, and his body moved, creating a six-pointed star array beneath his feet.

His body flashed, and he vanished from his original position, only to reappear simultaneously at the six points of the star array.

The six bodies were identical in both aura and appearance, making it impossible to distinguish which one was the real Yin Ming Dao Zu.

The yellow-robed man's empty eyes flickered, and he immediately regained his composure, his wrist trembling.

The grayish-white sword ray split into six, each one stabbing towards the six Yin Ming Dao Zus.

The six Yin Ming Dao Zus simultaneously formed a seal, and the surrounding air was filled with the sound of billions of ghostly wails. A series of black portals appeared, and countless demonic creatures from the outer realms emerged, engulfing the yellow-robed man and his companion.

Each demonic creature emitted a powerful aura, and there were even some that had reached the Great Luo Realm. The two sides clashed, and the battle raged on.

On the other side, White Cloud Dao Zu, the dwarf elder, and the Snowy Robe Man also flew out, charging towards the three Great Dao Zu of the Barbaric Realm.

The sky was filled with a kaleidoscope of colors as the six of them clashed, and the outcome was unclear. The only thing that could be heard was the sound of explosions and the clash of energies.

The Heavenly Court's Dao Zu were able to withstand the attacks of the Demon Realm and the Barbaric Realm, but the difference in strength between their disciples was enormous.

The Heavenly Court's disciples were quickly overwhelmed, and they were forced to gather together, forming defensive arrays to barely hold their ground.

In this state, the Heavenly Court's disciples were in a precarious position, unable to counterattack. If there was no turning point, they would be slowly worn down and annihilated.
In an instant, countless attacks rained down, and the defensive barrier formed by the Heaven's Court cultivators grew increasingly dim, their hopes growing weaker.

"It seems that the Wheel of Rebirth's side has the upper hand in this battle. But I wonder if the Wheel of Rebirth's Master can truly defeat Guo or Jin?" said Cang Wu Zhen Jun and the others, observing the situation from a distance, speaking in hushed tones.

"If we let Guo or Jin escape, the True Immortal Realm will likely fall into chaos," said Feng Xing Dao Zu, nodding in agreement.

"Since that's the case, we might as well lend the Wheel of Rebirth's Master a hand and capture Guo or Jin. Not only will we ensure the True Immortal Realm's peace, but we'll also gain a good opportunity for the future. According to rumors, the Wheel of Rebirth's Master is a decent person, or else the demonic and devilish tribes wouldn't cooperate with him," said Zhen Shi Yin, waving his hand to create a soundproof barrier around the three of them, then speaking in a low tone.

Feng Xing Da Han heard this and his eyes flashed with interest, but he didn't show any reaction, looking at Cang Wu Zhen Jun instead.

"Zhen Dao friend, when did you become the Wheel of Rebirth's spokesperson?" Cang Wu Zhen Jun asked, a hint of a smile on his face.

"Spokesperson? Cang Wu Dao friend, what are you talking about?" Zhen Shi Yin asked, taken aback, then shook his head and smiled.

"Earlier, at the Yaochi, you openly and secretly assisted the Wheel of Rebirth's Master, urging us to leave Yaochi. Anyone with eyes can see that! As far as I know, you recently received a large amount of celestial yuan stones and used them to buy a thousand-mile-long spirit vein in the Da Tian Yin immortal realm, planning to establish a sect there. If I'm not mistaken, those celestial yuan stones were given to you by the Wheel of Rebirth, right?" Cang Wu Zhen Jun asked, his voice measured.

Zhen Shi Yin's brow furrowed upon hearing this.

Feng Xing Dao Zu looked at Zhen Shi Yin with a hint of surprise.

"It's not just you, Zhen Dao friend. Many of the sects that chose to leave Yaochi have been secretly bought over by the Wheel of Rebirth," Cang Wu Zhen Jun continued.

"Is that so?" Feng Xing Dao Zu asked, surprised again.

"Hmph, if not for the Wheel of Rebirth's Master's wealth, how could he have convinced so many people to leave Yaochi?" Cang Wu Zhen Jun sneered.

"Wanting to buy over so many people, the required wealth is immeasurable. I estimate that the Wheel of Rebirth has poured all their accumulated wealth into this. What boldness!" Feng Xing Dao Zu exclaimed, impressed.

"Since you two know already, I, Zhen, won't hide it anymore. Cang Wu Dao friend, what you said is correct. The Wheel of Rebirth's Master did contact me earlier and asked me to persuade you two to help. He promised that if you two assist him, he'll give you the same reward as me," Zhen Shi Yin said, looking at Feng Xing Dao Zu with a smile.

"Rarely does the Wheel of Rebirth's Master hold me, Feng, in such high regard. Meanwhile, Guo or Jin is planning to destroy the world. Even if it's for the sake of the world, I know who to help. I'll do it!" Feng Xing Dao Zu said, his eyes flashing with determination.

"Wind Dao friend, you're a just and righteous person. Now that Heaven's Court is in danger, our combined efforts will surely succeed!" Zhen Shi Yin exclaimed, nodding vigorously.

Cang Wu Zhen Jun stood to the side, his expression unreadable.

"Cang Wu Dao friend, I know you have a grudge against the Wheel of Rebirth's Master, but now is not the time to seek revenge. If we let Guo or Jin escape, the world will likely face destruction. There's also something you might not know: the Wheel of Rebirth's Master has mastered the Wheel of Rebirth's law and possesses a six-path Wheel of Rebirth disk, which can control the reincarnation of the outside world. He promised that if you, Cang Wu Dao friend, help him, he'll use the six-path Wheel of Rebirth disk to reincarnate your fallen disciple and have them rejoin your sect," Zhen Shi Yin said to Cang Wu Zhen Jun.

"Is this true?" Cang Wu Zhen Jun asked, his body trembling with excitement.

"With the Wheel of Rebirth's Master's status, would he deceive you on such a matter? However, the Wheel of Rebirth's Master said that your disciple will not retain their memories from their past life, but their cultivation foundation will remain. You'll need to spend some time cultivating them again," Zhen Shi Yin explained.

"That's not a problem, as long as their cultivation foundation remains," Cang Wu Zhen Jun said, his expression relaxing.

"Since the Wheel of Rebirth's Master has spoken, I'm not a person who doesn't understand the situation. Very well, I agree to help," Cang Wu Zhen Jun said, nodding after a moment of contemplation.

Zhen Shi Yin's eyes lit up with joy upon seeing Cang Wu Zhen Jun agree.

The three of them gathered together, discussing how to take action.

...

Just as Han Li was wondering why the ugly old woman's aura had suddenly disappeared, a sudden change occurred!

A point of blue light appeared in the withered Dong Yi divine tree forest, and the blue light rapidly grew brighter. A small tree sprouted from the light, growing rapidly, and then, in a blurry moment, it grew four limbs and transformed into a slender, beautiful young woman.

The woman's body was surrounded by a strong, blue light that emanated a powerful wood-attribute law aura.

Han Li's eyes widened as he realized that the woman's aura was identical to the ugly old woman's.

What was going on?

The woman's body was still surrounded by the blue light, and her features were still indistinct, but her aura was unmistakable.
