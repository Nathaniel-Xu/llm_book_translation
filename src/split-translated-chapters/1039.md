About half a quarter of an hour later, a group of people came rushing up the mountain path, making a ruckus.

Among them, the one leading the way was none other than Yu Kuohai of the Ling Xiao Sect, with Yang Zonglao of Lieyang City and Fu Gu Zhu of Qing Su Valley following closely behind. The rest of the people from the three sects trailed behind them.

"Hmph, I'd better not run into that scoundrel who stole the treasure! If I do, I'll skin him alive and pound his bones to dust. I've never met anyone as ruthless as him in all my years," Yang Zonglao said, still seething with anger, as he walked and blew his nose.

"Yang Zonglao, calm down first. We all entered the secret realm together, and we were all searching in the areas designated by the Tian Shui Sect and the Tong Tian Sword Sect. It shouldn't be possible for someone to have gotten there first," Yu Kuohai said, deep in thought.

"What do you mean... are you saying it was those two sects playing tricks on us?" Yang Zonglao asked, taken aback.

"With the treasure at stake, people's hearts are hard to fathom, and anything can happen. Maybe they sent someone to secretly collect the treasure while we were being held back by the rules," Fu Gu Zhu said, after a moment's contemplation.

As soon as he spoke, the three of them started to murmur among themselves. If it was indeed those two sects playing tricks on them, did they have the strength to confront them?

"What's our plan going forward? We can't just keep being manipulated by them," Yu Kuohai asked, after a moment's silence.

Yang Zonglao and Fu Gu Zhu exchanged a look, but neither of them spoke up.

"It's true what they say, 'a powerful dragon doesn't press down on the local snake.' We're the local sects, and we can't just be pushed around by them. If word gets out, it'll be embarrassing," Yu Kuohai sighed.

"For now, we can only take it one step at a time. When we get to the other side, we'll have to be more careful. If we can grab an opportunity, we'll take it. If not, we'll just have to make sure we're not being used as pawns," Yang Zonglao said, shaking his head.

"You're right, we can only work together to compete with them," Fu Gu Zhu said, with a sigh.

Just as they were talking, they heard a commotion coming from the front of the mountain path.

Suddenly, a stout and burly middle-aged man, with tattered clothes, came running out of the forest, looking frantic. Behind him, a massive metal beast, shaped like a wild boar, was chasing after him.

The beast was over ten meters tall, with golden fur that stood on end like steel needles, and two sharp, golden tusks protruding from its mouth. It was chasing after the middle-aged man, who was running for his life.

When the man saw the group of people in front of him, he grabbed onto them like a lifeline, shouting, "Save me, save me!"

Before anyone could react, the middle-aged man ran up to them, leapt over their heads, and landed on a nearby tree, where he collapsed.

The metal beast chased after him, and the group of people from the Ling Xiao Sect, Lieyang City, and Qing Su Valley drew their magical tools, attacking the beast.

The beast was not very strong, and it was quickly defeated by the combined efforts of the group. Yang Zonglao delivered the final blow, striking the beast's head with a flame knife, and claiming its beast nucleus.

The metal beast's body was divided among the group, as it was a valuable material for crafting magical tools.

Once the dust had settled, the group turned to the middle-aged man, who was trying to escape. Yu Kuohai shouted, "Where do you think you're going?"

The man's hand jerked, and a black whip shot out, binding him. Yu Kuohai pulled him back, and the man fell to the ground.

"This guy looks familiar, but I've never seen him before," Fu Gu Zhu said, eyeing the man suspiciously.

"I don't recognize him either," Yang Zonglao said, shaking his head.

"We can search his soul to find out what's going on," Yu Kuohai said, with a sly smile.
"Fellow Daoist, let's talk this out, let's talk this out..." a middle-aged man hastily called out.

"Cut the nonsense, it's possible that this guy is that shameless tomb raider!" another person from the Ling Xiao Sect shouted.

"This person's background is unclear, it's not impossible..." Yang Lao said after a moment of contemplation.

The crowd heard this and began to agree, shouting for a soul search.

Yu Kuohai glanced at the man's somewhat wide eyebrow spacing and felt that this person looked a bit dull, not like a cunning individual. However, to be cautious, he still intended to perform a soul search on him.

This person's appearance was none other than Han Li, who had donned a mask and changed his appearance.

Earlier, he had sensed that this group was approaching, so he had a sudden idea to blend in with them and gather some useful information. Therefore, he had specifically gone to find the metal beast and lured it to chase him to this place.

However, just as he was about to make a move, he saw that the person's body suddenly flashed with golden light, and the black whip that was wrapped around him suddenly loosened, and he had already gotten up.

"Fellow Daoists, please don't be offended, I am Shi Mu," Han Li said with a bow, smiling foolishly.

The crowd saw that he had easily escaped from Yu Kuohai's restraints, and their expressions were all surprised. One by one, they drew their weapons and surrounded Han Li.

Han Li saw this and quickly used a spell to break free, explaining, "I'm not skilled in the great Dao, I only know some minor techniques. I hope you won't be offended, may I ask where this place is?"

Yu Kuohai and the others were confused by his question.

"You don't know where this is?" Yu Kuohai asked, his eyes slightly sinking.

"To be honest, I was previously in the mountains chasing after a strange beast. I don't know how I ended up in a strange mountain valley, and no matter how I looked around, I couldn't find a way out. Luckily, I know some techniques to break through obstacles, and I finally managed to break through the illusion. I ended up here, and before I could even take a few steps, I encountered that metal beast and was chased here," Han Li explained, feigning a terrified expression.

"Empty words are useless, we can't believe you. Previously, there was a thief who robbed us of many treasures and spiritual medicines before we could even get to them. We suspect that you are that person. If you want to prove your innocence, hand over your storage device, and we'll verify it," Yu Kuohai said with a cold smile.

"It's not that I'm not willing to cooperate, but my storage device is not something that can be shown to just anyone..." Han Li seemed to shrink his neck, arguing.

"Perhaps you have no choice, Fellow Daoist," Yang Lao said with a cold tone.

Han Li looked at the crowd surrounding him, his expression changing between hesitation and fear.

After a long time, he finally sighed and said, "Fine, I'll hand it over. Please take a look and let me go."

As he spoke, he removed a storage ring from his hand and handed it over.

Yu Kuohai took it and examined it with his divine sense, his eyebrows furrowing slightly as he handed it to Yang Lao.

Yang Lao also examined it and handed it to Fu Gu Zhu.

"You're a Golden Immortal, albeit only at the initial stage, how can you be so poor?" Fu Gu Zhu asked, unable to help but laugh.

"It's laughable, really... I'm just a lowly mountain hermit, I don't have the support of a sect like you all do. It's not easy to get resources for cultivation, and I don't have any savings," Han Li said with a bitter smile.

"It seems that you're indeed a careless hermit who stumbled into this..." Fu Gu Zhu said, handing the storage ring back.

Han Li quickly took it and put it back on his hand, smiling foolishly.

"Since you all have important matters to attend to, I won't bother you anymore. I'll take my leave," Han Li said, bowing and backing away.

"Wait, Shi Daoist..." Yu Kuohai suddenly said.

"Is there something else you'd like to say, Fellow Daoist?" Han Li asked, feigning confusion.

"Earlier, you said you know some techniques to break through obstacles and illusions. Is that true?" Yu Kuohai asked with a smile.

Han Li heard this and immediately put on a self-satisfied expression, replying, "I'm not bragging, but although my cultivation level is ordinary, I do have some skills in breaking through obstacles and illusions..."

"Of course, it's not comparable to your abilities, not at all..." Han Li said, seeming to realize his mistake and quickly adding.

"Yu Daoist, what's the meaning behind your question?" Yang Lao asked, transmitting his voice.

"Since the Tian Shui Sect and the Tong Tian Sword Sect want to use us as cannon fodder, why don't we find a cannon fodder to take the lead? This person has arrived, and he claims to be skilled in breaking through obstacles. Isn't that convenient?" Yu Kuohai replied, his expression unchanging as he transmitted his voice.
