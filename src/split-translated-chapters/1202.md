Master, do you think the person they mentioned, the Metal Devouring Immortal, is Jin Tong? Ti Hu asked.

What? You've found a lead on the boss? Xiao Bai exclaimed, hearing Ti Hu's words, in the flower petal space.

It's not impossible... Jin Tong is clever and resourceful, it's possible he escaped from the Jiu Yuan Guan. Han Li said, ignoring Xiao Bai, his voice low.

But if Jin Tong is nearby, why didn't he sense even a hint of his presence?

However, Jin Tong has now reached the Da Luo realm, his spiritual power has transcended, and he may have refined the spiritual imprint Han Li left in his body.

Master, those people have left. Ti Hu's eyes flashed, and he spoke.

Han Li heard this and turned to look, the six people had left the private room, quickly walking away.

Let's go, follow them. Han Li said, standing up without making a sound.

The auction was still only halfway through, and there were definitely many more treasures to be auctioned off, but he couldn't care about that now.

After the six people had walked far away, Han Li and Ti Hu left the room, following them, and quickly exited the auction hall.

The six people left the Ri Yue Pavilion, immediately flying towards the distance.

The city was filled with people at this hour, with people dressed in all sorts of strange and exotic clothing, so the six people, despite wearing black clothes, didn't attract any attention.

Han Li and Ti Hu followed from a distance, Xiao Bai was making a big fuss in the flower petal space, Han Li couldn't help but let him out.

The six people quickly arrived at the edge of the city, stopping for a moment.

This place was far from the bustling city center, and was inhabited by low-level cultivators and ordinary people.

One of the black-clad people stepped forward, taking out a blue crystal ball, and after a series of hand seals, a blue glow appeared inside the crystal ball.

At this moment, a faint golden light flashed within the blue glow.

That's right, the person is here. The black-clad person spoke, a female voice, belonging to Lan Yan.

Good, we've finally found this person's whereabouts. The petite figure exclaimed, then immediately made a series of hand seals.

A series of silver lights shot out from her sleeve, and a silver flag appeared, entering the nearby void.

The void in front of her trembled slightly, and a transparent half-sphere of light appeared, enveloping a large area.

The light screen had numerous silver patterns, looking mysterious and unusual, unlike ordinary seals.

The light screen had just appeared when it suddenly flashed and disappeared, without attracting the attention of the nearby cultivators.

With the Qian Kun Yi Qi Great Array, the Metal Devouring Immortal won't be able to escape. Another black-clad person laughed.

Enough talk, let's just capture the person! The petite figure coldly snorted, and flew forward, merging with the void.

The surrounding area appeared to have a series of transparent ripples, but they quickly disappeared.

The other five people followed closely, also entering the void.

After the six people had disappeared, three figures appeared in the air, it was Han Li and the others.

The three people's bodies were surrounded by a faint blue glow, looking like they were wearing a blue cloak.

This blue glow completely concealed their auras, without leaking out even a hint.

Han Li made a hand seal, and a golden light shot out, entering the void.

The void in front of him rippled with silver light, condensing into a series of symbols, which firmly blocked the golden light.

The two sides briefly clashed, before dissipating and disappearing.

This spatial seal is quite powerful, although it's not difficult to break, but it's likely that the five people will detect our tracks. Han Li frowned.

Spatial seals are no problem, just leave it to me, you two hide in my belly first. Xiao Bai said, his body flashing with white light, transforming into a Pi Xiu shape.

Xiao Bai opened his mouth, swallowing Han Li and Ti Hu, then his body began to glow with a white light.

The white light flashed, and Xiao Bai's body slowly merged with the surrounding void, transforming into a white shadow floating in the void, moving forward, and soon reached the seal.

The void in front of him rippled with silver symbols, trying to block the white shadow.

But the white shadow swirled and dissipated, like a cloud, and merged with the silver symbols, slowly passing through.

After the seal, the void appeared to have a series of white clouds, which gathered together, condensing into Xiao Bai's figure.

He opened his mouth, and two figures flew out, revealing Han Li and Ti Hu.

Xiao Bai, I didn't know you had this kind of divine ability, being able to penetrate spatial seals. Han Li said, slightly surprised.

Hehe, our Mu Yan Pi Xiu bodies have a natural spatial ability, our bloodline contains some spatial power. Xiao Bai's body flashed with white light, transforming back into his human form, with a proud expression.
Han Li smiled faintly and then gazed forward, his eyebrows suddenly furrowing.

The six figures had vanished, leaving no trace behind.

"Master, those people haven't disappeared, but have used magic to conceal their tracks. They're currently heading forward, and although we've used Xiao Bai's evasive symbol to hide our tracks, being too close still risks being discovered." Chi Huan's eyes gleamed with a hint of mystery as she pointed forward.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he immediately spotted the six figures in the distance, surrounding a small courtyard in a secluded alley.

"Let's go," Han Li said, his eyes flashing as he flew towards the courtyard.

Chi Huan and Xiao Bai hastily followed.

Han Li and the others concealed their auras, and Chi Huan used her secret technique to suppress their spiritual energy, only then approaching the courtyard.

Just as they were about to arrive, a loud explosion erupted from the courtyard.

A brilliant golden light burst forth, transforming into a golden vortex that swept across the surroundings, carrying with it a storm of wind and thunder that flattened the courtyard, leaving it in ruins.

Han Li and the others immediately halted their advance, retreating to the shade of an ancient tree.

As they watched, five or six figures flew out of the smoke, landing on the ground nearby. They were the same people Han Li had met at the Hundred Refinements Conference.

As the golden light dissipated, Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and he sensed a familiar aura.

"Not Jin Tong, but him..." Han Li exclaimed in surprise.

"Huh, it's not the boss, who is it?" Xiao Bai asked, puzzled.

Just as he finished speaking, a young man in a golden robe appeared amidst the ruins.

The man's features were handsome, and his face still bore the lazy expression Han Li had seen before. It was Qu Xian, the Devouring Gold Immortal.

"Ugh, why do you people keep pestering me?" Qu Xian scanned the surrounding crowd, his eyes lingering on each face before sighing.

"Friend, we don't need to resort to violence. If you return to the Heavenly Court with us, you'll see that I'm telling the truth. We truly mean no harm and only wish to treat you with courtesy and invite you to the Bodhi Banquet," a woman's voice said.

Han Li followed the sound and saw a woman in a black robe with a slender, curvaceous figure.

"Are they from the Heavenly Court? I thought they were from the Jiuyuan Sect," Chi Huan said, puzzled.

Han Li was equally perplexed, wondering why Lan Cai had gotten entangled with the Heavenly Court.

"I've been wronged by the Heavenly Court before, and I only just escaped from the Years Tower. You're coming after me again, and you expect me to trust you?" Qu Xian sneered.

"Perhaps there's been a misunderstanding," the woman replied emotionlessly.

"Save your breath. If you're truly treating me with courtesy, then I refuse to go. You can leave now," Qu Xian said, his voice cold.

"Fine, since you're not willing to listen, don't blame us for what's to come," the woman retorted, her voice icy.

As she spoke, she raised her hand, and a crimson mist burst forth from her sleeve, transforming into a fiery cloud that engulfed the area above Qu Xian's head.

At the same time, the ground erupted with countless tiny red dots that grew brighter and brighter, as if a swarm of fire ants were crawling out of the earth, leaving behind a trail of molten rock.

Han Li's eyes widened as he watched, his brow furrowing in concern.

"Isn't that...?" he muttered.

"Who is she, Master?" Xiao Bai asked, surprised.

"Don't be ridiculous, that's Chi Meng, a powerful cultivator of fire-attribute magic. She's also a Da Luo cultivator, and her methods are not to be underestimated," Han Li replied, his voice stern.

Xiao Bai rubbed his head, still gazing at the commotion.

The fire ants had almost surrounded Qu Xian, leaving only a small circle of empty space around him. It was unclear whether Chi Meng had intentionally spared him or if the ants were naturally afraid of the Devouring Gold Insect.

"Enough chatter, let's attack!" one of the black-robed figures, a tall, muscular man with a hoarse voice, shouted.

The others, except for Lan Cai, began to attack Qu Xian with their magic.

The muscular man took the lead, waving his sleeve to unleash a dark mist that spawned seven or eight terrifying creatures, the Luo Tian Ghost Kings, which charged towards Qu Xian.

"Looks like the person I sensed earlier, who cultivates divine soul magic, is him. His methods are similar to mine, but he's focused on the dark and sinister aspects, making him inferior," Chi Huan observed.

"Trivial tricks, how dare you show off?" Qu Xian sneered.

With a single step, he stomped the ground, causing a massive shockwave that sent the fire ants flying. A golden ripple spread out from his foot, forming a series of concentric circles that repelled the ants.

As the ants retreated, Qu Xian's fist glowed with an intense golden light, which he used to blast the Luo Tian Ghost Kings. The creatures let out ear-piercing screams as they were torn apart, their bodies disintegrating into dark ash.

A massive, golden sword, adorned with flashing symbols, descended from the sky, splitting the air and striking Qu Xian with incredible force.
