Although he possessed such unique cultivation conditions, Han Li still encountered some difficulties in comprehending the third statue.

This was because the cultivation method of the third statue had changed, completely different from before.

It required the simultaneous circulation of the power of the stars to impact the mysterious orifices, while using the power of blood qi as support, causing the fleshly body to undergo a transformation similar to demonification, growing three heads and six arms.

This method had extremely high requirements for blood qi power; otherwise, it would be impossible to simultaneously derive three heads and six arms.

Although Han Li's current blood qi power was strong, it still couldn't reach such a transformation.

A moment later, he remained sitting in the same spot, his mind rarely not continuing to ponder about the matter of the True Spirit bloodline.

He saw the corner of his mouth slightly lift, hooking a smile. He raised his hand and groped in his bosom, taking out the half piece of jade pendant that Zilin had given him, holding it in his hand and carefully examining it.

The jade pendant slowly rotated in his hand, casting a sparkling green light, inside which a blurry figure was reflected. Han Li looked at it, unable to help but feel a strange sense in his heart.

"What is the purpose of Zilin giving me this thing? It seems that there is nothing extraordinary about it. However, this figure's shadow is quite similar to me. Could it be an item that Zilin used to remember me in the past?" Han Li murmured.

In his deep-set eye sockets, some laughter seeped out.

He picked up the jade pendant's hanging string, and with a light rub of his fingers, the jade pendant began to spin rapidly in mid-air, pulling out traces of afterimages that connected into a patch, looking just like a green ball.

And within that green ball, a rather three-dimensional figure image also emerged.

Seeing this scene, Han Li's expression suddenly changed. He was stunned for a moment, then murmured, "Perhaps it can work, perhaps it can work..."

After speaking, he once again took out the four statues and placed them in front of himself, carefully observing them.

In the third statue of the Heaven Destroyer Prison Technique, it mentioned using the power of blood qi to change the fleshly body. Han Li couldn't achieve this solely relying on his own blood qi power, but if he changed it to the True Spirit bloodline, it might not be impossible.

This was just like the half piece of jade pendant and the figure's side profile within it. It wasn't necessary to separate you and I. The two merged into one, simultaneously operating. Perhaps, on the contrary, both could be accomplished?

However, before this, Han Li still had some concerns.

After all, the previous several instances of backlash from the True Spirit bloodline were more or less related to the operation of the Heaven Destroyer Prison Technique. If he were to simultaneously operate both at this moment, would it attract an even more violent backlash from the True Spirit bloodline? Han Li didn't have much confidence.

After pondering for a long time, he still decided to give it a try. At this point, the matter of the backlash of the True Spirit bloodline had already reached a critical juncture and could no longer be delayed.

Planning before acting, once he made the decision, Han Li no longer hesitated.

He held the third statue in his hand, and a beam of crystal light shot out from between his eyebrows, entering the statue, which then began to move.

Han Li was extremely familiar with all the actions of this statue. This time, he paid more attention to the profound text on the back of the statue, carefully examining the method of using blood qi power to change the body's form mentioned inside.

After confirming there was no danger, he began to follow the actions on the statue and started moving.

As his movements changed, over nine hundred mysterious orifices on his body lit up one after another.

At the same time, Han Li also began to silently circulate the True Spirit bloodline within his body.

A moment later, a feeling of irritation and heat came from his heart.

Han Li was very familiar with this. It was the precursor to the True Spirit bloodline's backlash. Soon after, the blood in his body would rapidly rise in temperature, becoming like boiling water.

He calmed his mind, trying to keep himself as calm as possible. Unlike before, he didn't attempt to use the methods from the Star Essence Blood Refinement Art to calm the restless blood. Instead, he began to guide the True Spirit bloodline within his body, according to the path recorded in the third statue, gathering it towards his shoulders and back.

It was fine not to try, but once he did, the True Spirit bloodline immediately surged towards his head like floodwater released from a gate.

Han Li suddenly felt a tearing pain in his neck and shoulders as the muscles in his shoulders swelled up, giving him a feeling of flesh growing.

However, accompanying this was the sharp pain in his knowledge sea's divine sense. The unbearable pain was like a powerful tearing force trying to tear his divine sense apart.

And the source of this power was precisely the raging True Spirit bloodline.

"Ah..."

The tearing pain simultaneously coming from his knowledge sea and body made even Han Li, who was used to all kinds of pain, find it somewhat hard to bear. He couldn't help but let out a series of screams.

What he found strange was that at this moment, his divine sense was unexpectedly clear, not as if he was about to lose it like before. But precisely because of this, the tearing pain was doubly clear.

However, this also proved that the method he had thought of before was indeed feasible.

After screaming in pain, Han Li gritted his teeth and focused on cultivating the Heaven Destroyer Prison Technique.
Underground cultivation, time unknown, in the blink of an eye, another five hundred years passed.

In a side hall of the crystal palace, layers of blood-red light shimmered like Buddha's treasure light.

In the blood light, a strange man with three heads and six arms, about a hundred feet tall, was sitting cross-legged on a lotus platform, waving his six arms and making various strange movements repeatedly.

On his shoulders, he carried three heads, none of which were human.

The one in the center was a golden monkey head resembling an angry-eyed Vajra, the one on the left was a majestic true dragon head, and the one on the right had golden eyes like lightning, an eagle beak, and plumes, a giant bird head.

After a series of movements, the strange man suddenly brought his six arms together, all doing the gesture of joining hands in front of his chest.

The blood-red halo enveloping him slowly converged, and his figure gradually shrank amidst the blood light. When all the light was gone, a bare-chested young man emerged, revealing Han Li.

He exhaled turbid energy and slowly opened his eyes, twisted his neck, and a smile appeared on his face.

Since discovering that the True Spirit bloodline could be integrated into the Heaven Defying Prison Technique, he had been practicing hard. Over the years, although the number of profound orifices had not changed much, remaining at over nine hundred, his physique had undergone tremendous changes.

What pleased him the most was that now, the backlash of the bloodline had been solved by half. The monstrous state he had just displayed was the result.

Now, when he activated the third statue's technique of the Heaven Defying Prison Skill, he could simultaneously invoke the bloodlines of the Mountain Giant Ape, True Dragon, and Sky-roaming Kun Peng. When transformed into the three-headed and six-armed form, his body possessed the enormous power of three True Spirits simultaneously, making the might far superior to before.

As of now, the backlash threat from these three True Spirit bloodlines had been completely resolved by him. As for the remaining few other True Spirit bloodlines, they could be resolved in the same way in the future.

According to Han Li's speculation, when he completed the cultivation of all the techniques of the Heaven Defying Prison Skill, he would be able to cultivate four different three-headed and six-armed forms, like the four statues. Each head would transform into the appearance of three True Spirits.

However, there was a certain randomness in this process, and the outcome was still unclear.

After resting for a moment, just as Han Li was about to get up, he suddenly found that the entire crystal palace began to shake violently. In the seclusion hall where he was, all the patterns on the walls and floors lit up without being activated.

His expression changed slightly, then his eyebrows twitched, and he flashed out of the hall door.

When Han Li arrived at the main hall where Crab Taoist was, he saw Crab Taoist floating out of the crystal coffin at the moment, enveloped by a substantial layer of white light.

His whole body was flashing with countless profound orifice light points, densely packed like stars in the sky, even more than the profound orifices on E'Luo's body.

Han Li's gaze swept over and quickly identified that Crab Taoist had a total of one thousand eight hundred profound orifices on his body!

Crab Taoist's body floated in mid-air for a moment, and as the starlight around him flickered, he exuded an overwhelming aura, several times stronger than before.

With Han Li's strength, he couldn't withstand this pressure and stood outside the hall, unable to step in, feeling shocked in his heart.

"This aura... could it be that Brother Crab's strength has reached the level of Dao Ancestor?"

"Huh?... What's this?" Han Li's face then flashed with a hint of surprise again.

Because there was clearly another figure lying in the crystal coffin at the moment, identical to Crab Taoist, except that the entire body was golden, and now the eyes were tightly closed, as if in deep sleep.

"Two Crab Taoist? No, this is not a person." He quickly recognized that the one lying in the coffin was not a person, but a golden puppet. However, Han Li keenly sensed that the aura of this puppet was somewhat strange. It was not a simple puppet, and something seemed to be sealed inside.

The floating Crab Taoist slowly opened his eyes, shooting out two dazzling golden lights, dignified and powerful.

The golden light then quickly spread out, enveloping Crab Taoist completely, filling the entire hall, and even Han Li outside the hall was covered.

Han Li's face was delighted. Being enveloped by this golden light, the nearby pressure in the void actually dissipated rapidly, and the fairy spiritual power within his body could operate normally, just like when he fought E'Luo before.

He immediately activated the fairy spiritual power, broke open the restrictions of the Fazhi space, and let his divine sense enter to check on Jiu Hun's situation.

Jiu Hun looked the same as before, with no changes, which relieved him.

As for Crab Taoist, his entire body was enveloped in golden light and his figure looked somewhat blurry. He looked up at the sky and then disappeared in a flash.

In the next moment, his figure appeared out of thin air above the Thousand Machines Hall.

Crab Taoist's golden light became even stronger, like a golden sun, illuminating all around.

Black One and Black Two, ordered to guard outside the hall, were both shocked to see this scene.

Before they could react, they felt their bodies enveloped by the golden light, and the pressure in the void around them suddenly vanished. The demonic energy in their bodies even began to flow freely.

However, the two had been in the Jilin Empty Realm for too long, and most of the demonic energy in their bodies had dissipated, with only a tenth remaining, so they didn't feel it strongly.
