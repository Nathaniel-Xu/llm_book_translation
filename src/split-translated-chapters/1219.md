Han Li stood still and scanned the area, discovering that many of the people Zhou Xianyang had mentioned earlier were now present on the stage.

Among them were Luo Yuanshan from Qing Hui Lin and Zi Luoxian from Tian You Hu, as well as Si Kongjian, who had disregarded his position as sect leader to participate in the selection.

The audience below was not pleased with Si Kongjian's actions, and some even felt that he was shameless. The surrounding area was filled with jeers and catcalls.

Si Kongjian, however, remained calm and composed, opening his fan with a "pap" sound and gently waving it back and forth. He seemed completely unaffected by the commotion.

Although the crowd was murmuring in disapproval, they couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for Si Kongjian's audacity. After all, if he succeeded in obtaining the Bodhi Command, the benefits would be enormous, enough to make anyone's eyes burn with envy.

From this perspective, Si Kongjian's gamble didn't seem foolish at all.

"Zhou Sect Leader, if your friend is lucky enough to draw Si Kongjian, you must make sure to defeat him. That way, the reputation of the Lone Yang Peak will be dragged down to the bottom, and you'll be able to avenge your long-held grudge," Zhao Yuanlai said with a smile.

"Drawing lots is just a matter of chance," Zhou Xianyang replied with a smile, but in his heart, he was secretly hoping that Zhao Bola would encounter Si Kongjian.

In reality, Si Kongjian's strength was already evident, and his reputation for being cunning and ruthless was well-known. Naturally, the others hoped to avoid facing him.

"I have 96 numbered tokens here. Each of you will choose one, and the number on the token will be your selection number. Later, we'll pair you up according to your numbers, and the first number will compete against the 96th number, the second number against the 95th number, and so on. Do you all understand?" the host elder asked.

"Understood," the participants replied in unison.

"Begin selecting your numbers," the host elder said, tossing the tokens into the air.

The 96 tokens flew up, shining brightly like stars, and hovered above the participants' heads.

The participants reached out and grabbed a token, and Han Li did the same, using a thread of spiritual energy to sense the number on the token.

"Number 91..." Han Li muttered to himself.

The surrounding crowd also looked at their tokens, and Si Kongjian's number became the focus of attention. He didn't hide it, instead, he raised his hand and showed off his token, which had the numbers "90" on it.

"How could this be..." someone in the crowd exclaimed.

The crowd turned to look, and saw a man with a pointed horn on his head and bulging cheeks, clutching a token and staring at Si Kongjian in despair.

The others felt a mix of emotions, including relief and sympathy for the unfortunate man.

"Ah, what a unlucky fellow. Brother Zhao, what's your number?" Zhao Bola asked, approaching Han Li.

Han Li showed him his token, and Zhao Bola's face stiffened. He then showed Han Li his own token, which had the number "6" on it, corresponding to Han Li's number 91.

"This is indeed... fate," Zhao Bola said with a wry smile.

He looked at Han Li with a mixture of sadness and regret, but his mouth twitched with suppressed laughter.

Earlier, when Zhao Yuanlai had communicated with him, they had already determined that "Chang Qi" was a useless and unremarkable person. Now that he had stumbled upon this great opportunity, he couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement.

"This... please, brother Zhao, go easy on me," Han Li said, trying to hide his true intentions.

"Brother Chang Qi, same to you," Zhao Bola replied, his confidence growing. He was still polite on the surface, but his tone was laced with sarcasm.

"The tokens have been selected. Please, the first 12 numbers and the last 12 numbers, proceed to the 12 Earthly Branches martial stages for the competition. The rest of you, please wait and prepare," the host elder announced.

Han Li and Zhao Bola happened to be among the first batch of participants, and according to the Earthly Branches, they were assigned to the 6th stage, the Si stage.

Si Kongjian's stage, the Wu stage, was right next to theirs, separated by only a hundred feet.

As the crowd cheered, the 24 participants took their places on the stages.

Zhou Xianyang and Zhao Yuanlai didn't have time to celebrate that Han Li and Zhao Bola hadn't drawn Si Kongjian, before they saw the two of them standing on the same stage.

"This is indeed... a coincidence," Zhou Xianyang and Zhao Yuanlai said in unison, almost simultaneously.
The two people's tone had a hint of surprise and a dash of schadenfreude.

"Master Zhou, our two families' sects have always been close, so no matter the outcome of the battle, let's not damage our harmony." Zhao Yuancheng turned to Zhou Xianyang and smiled as he said.

Zhao Yuancheng naturally thought that he had the upper hand, and was paving the way for Zhao Bolao to defeat Han Li.

"That's natural." Zhou Xianyang smiled in response.

Not to mention that Han Li was impersonating his own disciple, even if it was really Chang Qi fighting, he still had confidence in his own disciple.

The people sitting in the center of the stone platform, surrounded by the ring of the martial stage, were not very concerned about the battle on the stage. They were chatting with each other, creating a small, isolated world around themselves, and even those sitting next to them couldn't hear what they were saying.

"Phoenix Heavenly Envoy, I've heard that there have been disturbances all over the True Immortal Realm recently. Not only is the Wheel of Rebirth Temple restless, but even the Gray Realm is stirring up trouble. What's going on?" Pure Jun True Person asked.

"The Northern Cold Heavenly Domain, the Qing Mang Heavenly Domain, and the Black Mountain Heavenly Domain have all seen signs of Gray Realm creatures' activities, but they're all just small skirmishes, nothing to worry about." Phoenix Heavenly Envoy replied with a smile.

Pure Jun True Person's brow furrowed slightly upon hearing this. If the Heavenly Court was taking this attitude, it was a problem in itself.

"Didn't the Heavenly Court have some arrangements in the Gray Realm before? Has something changed?" Pure Jun True Person asked.

"There has been a change in the Gray Realm. The originally neutral Black String Domain has started to ally with the Wheel of Rebirth Domain, and the Nine Abyss Domain has also cut off its connection with our Heavenly Court under pressure. In short, it seems that they have unified their opinions and are now launching a large-scale invasion of the Immortal Realm." Phoenix Heavenly Envoy's face showed a hint of hesitation before he continued.

Pure Jun True Person was already aware of some of the information, but hearing it from Phoenix Heavenly Envoy's mouth still surprised him.

Many years ago, their ancestors had analyzed the future situation of the Immortal Realm, and now it seemed that it was slowly coming true.

As the two of them were talking, the square erupted in cheers, and the elder announced the start of the battle.

"Excuse me, Brother Bolao." Han Li looked at Zhao Bolao, bowed, and said.

"Please, Brother Chang, just attack." Zhao Bolao returned the bow, smiling.

He waved his hand, and a white light screen appeared, expanding to cover the entire martial stage.

The light screen shimmered, and a pattern of six-petaled snowflakes appeared on its surface, densely packed and beautiful.

"Brother Bolao's ice-attribute law's power is indeed profound, I've gained some insight." Han Li smiled.

"I've heard that Brother Chang is skilled in the cultivation of the body, so today I'll ask for your guidance." Zhao Bolao's words were polite, but his actions were ruthless.

He waved his hand, and a blue, icy aura burst forth from the ground, and the air was filled with the sound of ice freezing. A layer of blue ice crystals spread out, covering the entire martial stage.

Han Li stomped his foot, and a surge of white energy burst forth, shattering the blue ice crystals that were about to engulf him.

Zhao Bolao's smile grew wider, and he waved his hand again, summoning a wave of icy aura. The ground erupted with icy spikes, shooting towards the sky like spears.

Han Li's body glowed with a white light as he jumped into the air, avoiding the spikes.

Zhao Bolao followed closely behind, his hand grasping a blue long spear. With a swift stab, he aimed for Han Li's back.

Han Li could have easily dodged, but he was currently impersonating Chang Qi, and if he showed any unusual speed, it would only attract suspicion.

So, he simply sank his shoulder, and his body descended, landing on the tips of the icy spikes. He allowed the spear to pierce his shoulder.

Zhao Bolao's eyes widened in surprise, and he poured his spiritual energy into the spear. The spear's tip glowed with a blue light, and a wave of icy energy burst forth, freezing Han Li's shoulder and arm.

"Sorry, Brother Chang." Zhao Bolao's face was filled with a mixture of surprise and annoyance.

The spear in his hand trembled, and a surge of energy shattered the ice crystals that had formed on Han Li's arm.

Han Li felt a numbness in his arm, and the blue ice crystals that had frozen his arm shattered, disappearing into the air.

"How is this possible?" Zhao Bolao's face turned ugly as he stared at Han Li's arm.

"Brother Bolao, you might not understand our cultivation of the body. This little bit of icy energy isn't enough to harm me. You shouldn't hold back." Han Li's face was warm and smiling.

He raised his hand, and his arm glowed with a white light, as if it was bathed in starlight.
