Han Li and the other person continued to move forward, soon flying into a mountain range tens of thousands of miles away.

"Roooaaaar!"

As the flying car passed by a golden mountain peak, a golden light flashed on the mountain wall, and a golden wolf-like monster suddenly flew out, transforming into a golden arrow that pounced on the flying car, its jaws wide open.

Han Li snapped his fingers, and a golden sword energy shot out, striking the wolf-like monster.

With a "chi" sound, the wolf-like monster was cut in half from head to toe, spewing out large amounts of golden blood.

Han Li emitted a stream of blue light, holding up the two halves of the wolf-like monster's corpse.

The wolf-like monster had originally been in a warm and soft state, but after it died, its corpse quickly hardened, and by now it had transformed into two golden statue-like objects.

"Is this the Metal Beast?" Ti Hu cried out, her eyes blinking several times as she curiously looked over.

Han Li also looked at the two halves of the monster's corpse, reaching out to snap off a small piece of its body.

The hardened Metal Beast's corpse and some golden mineral deposits were almost indistinguishable, with no signs of life whatsoever.

Han Li waved his hand, tossing the two halves of the corpse away, his brow furrowed.

The Metal Beast's strength was secondary; what was more astonishing was that this creature could merge with the mountain rocks, making its stealth abilities extremely strong.

This wolf-like Metal Beast was merely a low-level Metal Beast, but if it were a higher-level one, Han Li wasn't sure if he could even detect it.

In this case, it seemed that staying outside to cultivate was not a good idea.

The two of them continued to move forward, flying for a short while.

"Save me, save me..."

Just then, a series of divine thoughts transformed into sound waves came from the left front, seemingly from a woman, her voice extremely pitiful and evoking sympathy.

This divine thought wave was very unusual, directly transmitting into the hearts of the two people.

Han Li's eyebrows twitched; this technique of transforming divine thoughts into sound waves was novel, far surpassing the usual method of transmitting thoughts.

"Master, should we..." Ti Hu looked at Han Li, her expression filled with sympathy.

"Let's go take a look." Han Li had no intention of getting involved in other people's business, but since Ti Hu had spoken up, he couldn't refuse, and besides, he was somewhat curious about the owner of this voice.

He pinched his fingers, turning the flying car around, and simultaneously used a secret technique to conceal their tracks, flying towards the source of the sound.

A few breaths later, the flying car stopped beside a valley, where five golden lights were surrounding a beautiful young woman in a green dress, fiercely battling.

The voice for help was coming from the young woman.

The young woman's situation was not good; her protective green light was being suppressed to a thin layer, and could break through and kill her at any moment. She was desperately resisting the attacks around her, while also emitting the unusual sound wave to seek help.

"Ah!" Han Li's face revealed a hint of surprise.

This young woman in green was a member of the demon tribe, her cultivation not weak, having already reached the mid-stage of the True Immortal realm.

And the golden lights surrounding her were five Daoist priests wearing golden crown robes, with a golden horse pattern on their sleeves, looking like the uniform of a certain sect.

These five people had also reached the True Immortal realm, although they were only at the initial stage, but they had the advantage of numbers.

The five people were holding golden flags, using their magic to form a golden light circle, tightly suppressing the young woman.

"Haha, little demon girl, hand over the Golden Dragon Beast's inner pellet, and surrender obediently. Looking at your pure and unadulterated green fox bloodline, we won't kill you, but will take you in and offer you as a birthday gift to our master." The leader of the five Daoist priests, a tall and thin man, sneered.

"Your green fox tribe is just a small and insignificant tribe, on the verge of being destroyed by other forces at any moment. What future do you have? Our Golden Horse Sect is a hundred times stronger than your green fox tribe, and our master is a Golden Immortal, being able to become his concubine is your good fortune, don't be ungrateful!" Another Daoist priest wildly laughed.

"Hmph! If it weren't for the fact that I exhausted most of my energy in the great battle with the Golden Dragon Beast, you five would not be able to trap me!" The young woman in green gritted her teeth and retorted.

"Since you're not willing to accept our offer, big brother, let's not waste any more words on this demon girl. Use the Five Golden Radiance Array to break her protective green light and seal her cultivation, then offer her to our master. He has always wanted a green fox tribe concubine, and if we offer him the young master of the green fox tribe, he will definitely be pleased and reward us heavily." A short and fat Daoist priest shouted.

"Impossible, the Five Golden Radiance Array is too powerful, and breaking her protective green light will likely damage her foundation. What's the point of offering her to our master then?" The tall and thin Daoist priest shook his head and said.

"Big brother is right!"

"We almost got impulsive and ruined a great gift!"

"Indeed, let's slowly grind down her last bit of demonic energy instead!"

The other Daoist priests all chimed in.

The young woman in green heard the five Daoist priests treating her like a piece of meat, and her anger surged. The green light on her body suddenly brightened, and the tail behind her suddenly tensed up, a burst of green fox hair shooting out, emitting a terrifying whistling sound as it struck the surrounding golden light circle.

The golden light circle instantly shook violently, rapidly becoming thin.

The five Daoist priests saw this and quickly spat out a stream of essence blood, injecting it into the golden flags in their hands.

The golden flags instantly flew out, merging with the golden light circle, and the five Daoist priests simultaneously used their hands to cast a spell.
The golden light ring immediately stabilized, withstanding the attack of the fox hair.

The blue-clothed girl's attack was unsuccessful, and the blue light on her body quickly dimmed, finally shattering with a loud crash.

She seemed to be unstable, falling towards the ground.

The five Taoists were overjoyed at the sight.

The lead Taoist, with a lecherous smile on his face, flew out and reached out to grab the blue-clothed girl.

"Master!" The Wailing Soul cried out in urgency and anger, looking at Han Li, who remained unmoved.

"Don't worry, the unfortunate one is not that girl," Han Li said with a calm smile.

The Wailing Soul was taken aback by his words, and just then, the situation on the ground took a drastic turn.

The blue-clothed girl, who had been unstable, suddenly steadied herself as the lead Taoist approached. Her clear eyes flashed with a cold light.

The lead Taoist was shocked, realizing he had fallen into a trap. He tried to stop himself and retreat, but it was too late.

The blue-clothed girl raised her hands, and several blue lights shot out, striking the lead Taoist.

The blue lights were extremely sharp, easily piercing the lead Taoist's protective light and revealing his true form - a few fingers.

The lead Taoist's vital points were struck, and he spat out blood, his eyes filled with regret. He fell to the ground, his life force quickly fading away.

The blue-clothed girl had successfully counterattacked, but she had exhausted her demonic energy and could no longer stand, falling to the ground.

The other four Taoists, enraged, attacked the blue-clothed girl with various magical artifacts.

The girl's face showed no fear, calmly gazing at the attacks as they fell upon her. Her hand, hidden behind her back, was pinching a spell, her eyes flashing with determination.

Just then, a blue light appeared above the blue-clothed girl's head.

The attacks fell upon the blue light, which seemed to be as soft as cotton. The magical artifacts sank into it, but the blue light suddenly flashed, and the artifacts rebounded, striking the four Taoists with increased speed.

The four Taoists' bodies exploded, turning into a bloody rain.

The blue-clothed girl's eyes widened in shock, but her hand remained steady.

Just then, two figures descended from the air, revealing Han Li and the Wailing Soul.

"Thank you, sirs, for saving my life," the blue-clothed girl said, her face pale, as she struggled to stand up and bow to the two.

"It was nothing, don't be polite," the Wailing Soul said, hastily waving his hand and releasing a stream of light to support the girl.

The blue-clothed girl did not show any resentment towards the Wailing Soul's kindness, instead smiling at him, and her hand relaxed.

"What's your name? Which faction of the Golden Source Mountain Range do you belong to? And what's the situation with these people?" Han Li asked the girl, glancing at the Wailing Soul.

"I'm Ye Susu, a member of the Qing Huo tribe," the girl replied respectfully. "These people are disciples of the Golden Horse Sect, and we've always been at odds with them. I was hunting a Golden Python beast, but my energy was severely depleted, and they took advantage of me. Luckily, I met you two sirs."

Han Li's eyes flashed with interest.

"I intervened because of the Wailing Soul, and also because you're a member of the fox tribe," he said. "Perhaps you have a connection to the Tian Huo tribe, where Liu Le'er is from."

Ye Susu explained that the Golden Horse Sect was the largest faction in the area, with over 10,000 disciples and several Golden Immortals, including a powerful elder who had reached the late stage of the Golden Immortal realm.

Han Li listened attentively, nodding his head.

Ye Susu answered Han Li's questions, her face pale and almost translucent, her body trembling slightly. However, she remained standing, gritting her teeth.

"You're injured, so let's focus on recovering your wounds first," Han Li said, raising his hand.

A blue light shot out from his hand, entering Ye Susu's body. She felt a warm, powerful energy flowing into her, restoring her damaged body and stabilizing her energy.

The energy eventually merged with her demonic core, causing it to glow brightly and expand slightly.

Ye Susu sat down, cross-legged, and began to circulate her energy, ignoring her exhaustion.
