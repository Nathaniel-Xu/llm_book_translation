Wu Yang nodded after hearing Han Li's words, and his eyes fell on Han Li's body once more, with a hint of approval.

"You've already caught up with each other, let's discuss the main topic now," said Jiao San.

Han Li looked at Jiao San and asked, "Before we begin, can you tell me about Jin Tong's current situation?"

Jiao San replied, "For now, I can only tell you that Jin Tong is temporarily safe. We have already discovered her location, and if you complete your task, we will inform you of her whereabouts and provide necessary assistance."

Han Li furrowed his brow and asked, "So, completing the task is the condition for you to tell me Jin Tong's location?"

Jiao San's expression remained unchanged, and he said calmly, "Han Dao friend, it's not that we're threatening you. Your task is just one crucial part of the entire task. Once you complete it, we can proceed with the next plan, and only then will you have the opportunity to rescue Jin Tong."

Han Li was silent for a moment before asking, "What is my task?"

Jiao San replied, "The Heavenly Court's messenger has arrived at the Nine Yuan City, and the selection conference will likely be held soon. We want you to participate in the selection and compete for a spot to attend the Bodhi banquet."

Han Li asked, "How will the selection conference proceed?"

Wu Yang explained, "The Bodhi banquet has allocated a hundred spots for the entire Da Jin Yuan Xian Domain. The Nine Yuan Guan, Bai Cuo Shan, Jin Yuan Xian Domain, and the Day and Night Alliance will each take a portion of the spots. At most, only ten to twenty spots will be left for the other sects in the Da Jin Yuan Xian Domain to compete for. You will need to fight with the other competitors to obtain one of the spots."

Jiao San added, "The biggest challenge for you in this selection is that you must conceal your identity while winning, and ultimately obtain a Bodhi token."

Han Li shook his head and said, "This is impossible. Although I'm not well-known in the Jin Yuan Xian Domain, many people know me. I just saw Chi Meng Zhi, the Da Luo cultivator, in the city. If I participate in the selection and fight with others, they will surely recognize my identity, and I won't be able to save Jin Tong, let alone myself."

Jiao San said, "Han Dao friend, don't worry. The black mask I gave you earlier is specifically for this purpose."

Han Li frowned and said, "How can it help? Although the mask can conceal my aura and change my appearance, my cultivation technique and spiritual energy will still be recognizable once I start fighting."

Jiao San replied, "You're underestimating the mask's abilities. When you wear it, you can absorb a portion of the opponent's spiritual energy and aura, and after merging it with your own through a secret technique, you can achieve a level of deception that even a Da Luo cultivator may not be able to detect, as long as you don't use the Time Law."

Han Li asked, "But I'm not from the Da Jin Yuan Xian Domain, so don't I lack the qualifications to participate in this selection?"

Wu Yang said, "You can rest assured, your identity for participating in this selection has already been arranged. You will be competing under the name of a Xian Shan Sect elder."

Han Li had heard of the Xian Shan Sect, which was a mid-sized sect in the Da Jin Yuan Xian Domain that had not joined the Day and Night Alliance. Although its power was not insignificant, it had never been known to have any dealings with the Lu Xian Hall.

Han Li asked, "So, the Xian Shan Sect is a secret pawn of the Lu Xian Hall in the Da Jin Yuan Xian Domain?"

Jiao San replied, "You could say that. However, only a few people within the Xian Shan Sect know about this. This time, their sect master, Zhou Xian Yang, will personally lead the team to participate in the selection conference and has already settled in the sect's mansion in the west of the city. When the time comes, you just need to wear this token and find him, and he will know what to do."

Jiao San handed Han Li a white jade ring and said, "Your task is to complete your part of the work, and later we will tell you where Jin Tong is being held and how you can rescue her."

Han Li thought for a moment before nodding silently.

Jiao San and Wu Yang then left, and as they departed, Wu Yang suddenly said, "You've already received the old ancestor's opportunities, learned the 'Great Five Elements Fantastical World Technique', and helped my Zhen Yan Sect severely injure the traitor Qi Mo Zi. You're already half a member of my sect, and as your senior, I'll give you a gift to commemorate our meeting."

Wu Yang handed Han Li a golden inkstone, which landed in his hand.

Before Han Li could decline, Wu Yang and Jiao San had already dispersed and disappeared into the courtyard.

Han Li held the golden inkstone and examined it carefully, seeing that it was engraved with a sleeping yellow cow, its lines flowing smoothly, and its shape lifelike. He infused some spiritual energy into it, and the inkstone's surface rippled with golden waves, emitting a powerful aura of earth-attribute law.

Han Li's heart was delighted, and he carefully examined the inkstone again, finding no marks or seals on it. He didn't rush to refine it, instead storing it in his storage ring.

Later, he waved his hand, and a silver light door appeared before him. Han Li stepped through the door and entered the Hua Zhi Dong Tian.

He arrived at a room on the second floor of the bamboo building, where he saw Qi Huan sitting on the bed with her eyes closed, her face pale.

Blue Yan, who was standing by the window, immediately approached Han Li, bowed, and said...
Han Li.

"How is it?" Han Li asked, seeing that her face was not good, but her eyes had a faint glow, and she asked.

"The previous Soul Planting Ceremony went smoothly, my brother's soul has been planted in the Dream Flower, and only needs to rest for a while. It's just that the Wailing Soul Girl has exhausted herself too much, and is a bit worn out..." Lan Yan said with some guilt.

Han Li looked at the Wailing Soul, and his gaze fell on a black round basin on the round table in the room.

 Inside the basin, a dark red loose soil was planted, and a strange black stem was growing, with seven black leaves on top, and a layer of silver crystal light floating on top, and a white flower bud the size of a fist was growing, with a faint glow, shining dimly.

Han Li's divine sense swept over, and he sensed Lan Yuanzi's aura.

"After all, it's a matter of the soul, and we can't be careless. If there's anything that needs help, just say so." Han Li said.

"Brother Han and Wailing Soul have helped me so much, I'm already grateful, where would I dare to have any other hopes, just hoping that one day I can repay Brother Han by being a cow or a horse." Lan Yan's face was solemn, and she said quickly.

Han Li saw this, and didn't say anything else, just comforted her with a few words, and then turned and left.

...

The west of Jiuyuan City was a place where several rivers converged, the terrain was low, but it was flat and open.

Because of the water system, the vegetation was dense, and the scenery was unique. Many medium-sized sects in the Da Jin Yuan Xian Domain had spent a lot of money to buy a piece of land here, and used it to open a sect's courtyard.

The Xian Shan Sect, as a medium-sized sect in the Da Jin Yuan Xian Domain, was no exception, and occupied a place with a dense water system, and built a large Xian Shan Courtyard.

On this day, a white-clothed, snow-like handsome young man came to the door of the courtyard, holding a folding fan in his hand.

The guard saw his majestic appearance, and his extraordinary aura, and couldn't see through his cultivation level, so he didn't make things difficult for him, and simply made a transmission.

After a long time, a long-bearded old man in a plain white robe came out.

The old man heard the guard's words, and thought that it was a big shot, but when he came to the door, he saw that it was a young man with a excellent appearance, and his cultivation level was only in the middle of the Golden Immortal, so he was a bit annoyed.

"Is it Brother Han who wants to see our sect master? Unfortunately, our sect master is not in the courtyard today, Brother Han, if you have any business, you can tell me, and I'll pass it on to him when he returns." The old man's face was unchanged, and he asked.

The young man heard this, and his eyebrows furrowed, and he held a white jade ring in his hand, and said, "Since you're not the sect master, I won't talk to you, let your sect master come and see me."

This young man was naturally Han Li.

The long-bearded old man heard this, and his eyes flashed with anger.

"Do you think my cultivation level is too low, and I'm not qualified to let him come and see you?" Han Li asked.

Before the old man could answer, his aura suddenly changed, and his cultivation level surged, and in the blink of an eye, he reached the middle of the Tai Yi.

The long-bearded old man saw this, and his face changed again, and he was shocked.

Being able to suppress one's aura was not unusual, but being able to suppress it so naturally, and making himself look foolish, was really rare.

"Ah, it's Brother Han, I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you." The old man hurriedly bowed.

At the same time, he was secretly transmitting a message, telling the people inside the courtyard to be prepared, in case it was an enemy who came to the door.

"Don't worry, I don't have any malicious intentions, I just want to see your sect master about something. I know he's in the courtyard, so you can take this token and go in, he'll see me when he sees it." Han Li sighed, and said.

He handed the jade ring to the old man.

"I'll obey, please wait for a moment, Brother Han." The old man hastily accepted the token, and said.

After saying that, he flashed and rushed into the courtyard.

Not long after, a white light flashed from the courtyard, and a giant man with a sturdy build appeared, with a national character face, and a warm smile, and he walked towards Han Li.

"Brother Han, it's been a long time, haha..." The giant man's voice was loud, and it shook the door.
