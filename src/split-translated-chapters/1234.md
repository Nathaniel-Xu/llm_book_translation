“Really?” Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he asked.

“Hmph, I shouldn't say too much, but if we're looking for someone of the same kind, I, Qu Lin, have a certain level of confidence.” Qu Lin chuckled, a hint of pride in his voice.

What Qu Lin didn't know was that Han Li's question wasn't directed at him, but rather at the Weeping Soul within the Flower Branch Space.

“From Qu Lin's soul fluctuations, it seems he's not lying.” The Weeping Soul's voice echoed in Han Li's mind.

“That's great, let's go find old...that Gold Eater Immortal.” Xiao Bai exclaimed excitedly.

Han Li shot Xiao Bai a glance, and the latter's neck shrunk as he chuckled dryly.

“Qu Lin, could you please lead the way?” Han Li asked, turning to Qu Lin.

“This place is the Nine Yuan Observatory, and the mountain valley ahead looks treacherous. You want me to sense the Gold Eater Immortal's presence, but asking me to lead the way is a bit excessive, don't you think?” Qu Lin sneered, his voice laced with disdain.

“Han Li's request is indeed a bit forceful, but Qu Lin, if you have any conditions, feel free to state them.” Han Li replied calmly, a hint of a smile on his face.

“Qu Lin is currently at a critical juncture in his cultivation, and I need a large amount of yuan energy to aid me. I don't want much, but if Han Li can gift me five hundred million yuan stones or treasures of equivalent value, I'll take the risk to help you.” Qu Lin's eyes gleamed as he spoke.

“Five hundred million yuan stones? You might as well go rob someone!” Xiao Bai's anger flared up as he shouted.

“The price is set, whether you accept it or not is up to Han Li.” Qu Lin ignored Xiao Bai's outburst, his voice flat.

“Alright, I accept. But I'll only give it to you after we find the Gold Eater Immortal.” Han Li gazed deeply at Qu Lin before speaking.

“Straightforward, then it's settled.” Qu Lin laughed, seemingly pleased.

“Now that we've agreed, let's head into the valley. Xiao Bai, you and the Weeping Soul stay hidden in the Flower Branch Space, don't reveal yourselves. I'll go with Lan Dao and Qu Lin to search for the Gold Eater Immortal.” Han Li instructed.

Xiao Bai wanted to protest, but caught Han Li's gaze and swallowed his words, nodding instead.

Han Li waved his hand, and Xiao Bai was drawn into the Flower Branch Space. Then, Han Li activated the Black Mask, enveloping himself, Lan Yan, and Qu Lin in a dark aura as they flew towards the mountain valley.

As they entered the valley, a mournful cry echoed through the air, followed by a gust of dark wind that blew fiercely from within. The wind carried a potent mixture of killing intent and resentment.

Han Li's trio felt a surge of images in their minds, depicting a mountain of skulls and a sea of blood, with an endless tide of killing intent threatening to engulf their souls.

Han Li subtly activated his Cultivation Technique, instantly dispelling the killing intent.

Qu Lin seemed unaffected, his body glowing with a soft light as he effortlessly deflected the killing intent. Only Lan Yan's face turned pale, but she recovered quickly, her expression unreadable.

“Lan Dao seems to be struggling, Han Li, perhaps you should reconsider this plan.” Qu Lin glanced at Lan Yan before speaking.

“Lan Dao, if you can't withstand this place's killing intent, I'll have you enter the Flower Branch Space as well.” Han Li offered.

“No need, I can still hold on. I'm familiar with the Nine Yuan Observatory, and staying here will be useful to you.” Lan Yan's expression turned resolute as she shook her head.

“Alright, don't force yourself.” Han Li nodded.

Qu Lin observed this, his expression unreadable, before continuing on his way into the valley.

The valley floor was a barren expanse of black stone, devoid of any structures or vegetation due to the dark wind. Qu Lin halted suddenly, closing his eyes as if sensing something. After a moment, he opened his eyes and spoke.

“Should be around here somewhere.”

“I've heard that the Ghost Spirit Child built his palace underground. It seems this place has another hidden realm, but I wonder where the entrance is?” Lan Yan's eyes scanned the surroundings, her voice barely above a whisper.

Han Li listened, then activated the Nine Yin Magic Eyes, carefully observing the environment without expanding his divine sense to avoid detection.

He soon discovered something, his figure fluttering as he landed before a large black stone.

“Is this the entrance?” Lan Yan asked, her eyes fixed on the stone, but she didn't notice anything unusual.

Han Li smiled faintly, not responding. He reached out with one hand, and five streams of green light erupted from his fingers, coalescing into a massive green sword shadow that struck the black stone.

The black stone burst into radiant black light, forming a dark column that rose to meet the green sword shadow.

Han Li's eyes gleamed as he raised his other hand, striking the black column with a bolt of golden lightning.

The black column shattered, the black stone beneath it crumbling as the ground gave way, revealing a massive black hole.

A staircase descended into the depths of the earth, vanishing into the darkness.

“Hmph, Han Li, your methods are indeed impressive. No hidden passage or restriction can escape your notice.” Qu Lin chuckled, his eyes gleaming with excitement as he gazed into the black hole.
"If it weren't for your confidence, I wouldn't have been able to find this place," Han Li said. "Qu Xuan, please continue to lead the way."

Qu Xuan didn't say anything more and led the two of them into the cave.

A dark, icy wind burst out from below, creating whirlpools of varying sizes that emitted a mournful wailing sound, stronger than the wind outside.

The three of them quickly increased their protective spiritual light to resist the biting wind.

On the walls of the cave, a layer of black ice condensed, emitting an intense, icy aura.

"This is Black Yin Ice, which only forms in places where the concentration of ghostly energy and underground yin energy is extremely high," Han Li immediately recognized. "It's an excellent material for crafting ghostly, yin-based artifacts, not only is it extremely hard, but it also has the effect of attacking the soul."

Lan Yan and Qu Xuan also quickly recognized the Black Yin Ice, and although there was a large amount of it, they didn't make a move to take it, as they were focused on their mission.

The cave was very deep, and after walking down the stairs for a full quarter of an hour, they finally reached the end of the stairs. The view opened up, and a 20-30 zhang square hall appeared before them.

The hall's ceiling was embedded with several fist-sized white stones that barely lit up the environment.

The floor and walls were made of dark blue bricks, with some intricate patterns carved into them, giving off a solemn atmosphere.

However, as they looked around, the hall was empty, except for a door at the far end, which led to a black passageway.

The howling wind suddenly weakened, but the icy, ghostly aura became even more intense.

Han Li and Qu Xuan could still withstand it, but Lan Yan's cultivation was the weakest, and despite using his spiritual energy to protect himself, he was still affected by the cold. His teeth chattered, and his blood vessels showed signs of freezing.

Han Li noticed Lan Yan's condition and furrowed his brow.

At that moment, a purple light flashed in his hand, and a purple orb appeared, surrounded by a dreamy aura.

"Give this to Lan Yan to wear, it can effectively resist the invasion of ghostly energy," a voice whispered in Han Li's mind.

Han Li smiled slightly and handed the purple orb to Lan Yan.

Lan Yan was taken aback, then quickly put on the orb, and a faint purple glow enveloped his body, weakening the intense, icy aura.

"Thank you," Lan Yan said, relieved.

Han Li waved his hand, and the three of them continued forward, soon passing through the hall and exiting through another door.

Ahead of them was a three-way fork, with three passageways leading in different directions, shrouded in darkness.

Han Li furrowed his brow, using his spiritual sense to probe the three passageways, but as soon as his spiritual sense left his body, a strange, icy aura invaded the air, attacking his soul.

"This place is truly sinister, don't release your spiritual sense," Han Li hastily retracted his spiritual sense and used his cultivation technique to refine the invading aura.

Lan Yan acknowledged, while Qu Xuan seemed to have already discovered this point and remained calm.

"Qu Xuan, it seems that this Ghost Spirit's lair is enormous, with many restrictions, we can only rely on you," Han Li said.

Qu Xuan nodded, closed his eyes, and a faint golden light appeared on his body. He soon opened his eyes and pointed to the left passageway.

"Let's go this way," he said.

Han Li nodded and continued to lead the way.

This passageway was also very long, and after walking for a quarter of an hour, they finally reached the end, entering a large stone chamber.

The chamber was empty, except for two passageways leading in different directions.

Han Li furrowed his brow, asking Qu Xuan to sense the location of the Golden Boy, and then followed him into one of the passageways.

The underground space was vast, with passageways leading in all directions, but fortunately, there were no ghostly creatures attacking them.

Under Qu Xuan's guidance, the three of them moved quickly, making good progress.

According to Han Li's estimate, they had traveled hundreds of miles, and according to Qu Xuan, they were close to the Golden Boy's location.

Han Li heard this but didn't show any signs of relaxation.

After all, their journey so far had been too smooth, and this Ghost Spirit's lair shouldn't be so easily breached.

Especially since the Ghost Spirit himself was not present, it shouldn't be this easy.

Han Li thought to himself, but his expression remained calm, and he only increased his vigilance, carefully sensing the surroundings.
