Han Li arrived at the main building's exterior, looking up at the river of light in the sky. The stars twinkled like a thousand rivers had merged into one.

He gazed at the river, and suddenly, the stars began to move, tracing a path of glittering starlight, like a meteor shower.

His heart stirred, and he felt a strange sensation, as if the river was emitting waves of time law power.

He scanned his surroundings, and the space around him seemed frozen, enveloped by the time law power, entering a unique state.

Han Li witnessed this extraordinary scene, and his mind immediately reacted. He formed a hand seal, and the Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique began to circulate within him. The five time law objects, including the True Words Treasure Wheel, emerged and floated in the air around him.

As he spread his hands, the five objects flew into the river of light above his head.

The threads of time law power within the objects began to disperse, like cotton threads falling into the river, merging with the light.

The river of light erupted in a blaze of golden light, descending like a golden rain, flooding the entire space, and filling it with time law power.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat, thinking that all the time law threads had dispersed into the void. He quickly waved his hand.

A pale golden light screen expanded, forming a massive time domain, enveloping the entire space.

He waved his hands in the air, trying to recall the scattered time law threads through the domain. However, it had no effect.

Instead, the five time law objects, sensing the domain's appearance, released transparent Dao patterns that merged with the surrounding space.

The domain began to fluctuate intensely, and the True Words Treasure Wheel let out a loud roar, leaving Han Li's side and flying into the air, transforming into a full moon suspended in the void.

Golden light rays burst forth from the moon, illuminating the entire domain, its radiance surpassing the sun's, yet without any heat.

At the same time, the Fantian Hourglass fell to the ground, transforming into a sea of sand that spread out, filling the domain with a golden hue.

Han Li watched the scene, feeling a strange sensation in his heart.

This time, the transformation of the time law objects seemed different from before.

The True Words Treasure Wheel, suspended in the air, displayed a more solid connection to the domain, as if it was about to merge with it.

"Could it be that it's about to reach the level of creation?" Han Li thought, shocked.

Before he could finish his thought, the Light and Shadow Purification Bottle above his head suddenly tilted, pouring its golden liquid onto the sandy ground.

The liquid flowed through the sand, but instead of seeping in, it grew stronger, forming a golden river that flowed through the sand.

The sand began to shift, forming hills and valleys, taking on the shape of mountains and rivers.

The Eastern Yi Divine Tree's shadow fell onto the sandy hills, and suddenly, a lush forest emerged, spreading out.

All the emerging landscapes, like the moon above, began to merge with the domain, undergoing a strange transformation.

Han Li realized that his domain was changing, and the merging speed was extremely slow. He immediately jumped into the air, floating in a seated position.

He fully activated the Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique, releasing his time law power and spiritual energy into the domain.

As his power dispersed, the merging speed of the time law objects increased, but it was still very slow.

At this rate, even with the support of the Light and Shadow Heavenly Array, it would take an unknown amount of time to succeed. The array would consume a large amount of spiritual stones, and he had only set it up for a hundred years, equivalent to ten thousand years.

Subtracting the two thousand years he had spent in seclusion, he was left with only eight thousand years.

It was impossible to stabilize the domain's creation level within eight thousand years, and he didn't have that much time to waste.

"Time is insufficient... Perhaps I should focus on completing the fusion of one object first." Han Li sighed, speaking to himself.

He decided to focus on the Eastern Yi Divine Tree, and with a hand seal, he directed the time law power and spiritual energy towards it.

The other time law objects' merging speed slowed down, while the Eastern Yi Divine Tree's light grew more solid.

"It's effective," Han Li thought, pleased with himself.
Han Li chose the Dong Yi Divine Wood first because he wasn't confident in the outcome of this method, so he didn't choose to merge with his most familiar True Speech Treasure Wheel.

As time passed, Han Li's heart remained calm and peaceful. He continuously released the spiritual energy and time law power from his body to nurture the spiritual domain's maturity.

Before long, another two thousand years passed in the Flower Branch Space.

However, for the world outside the space, only twenty years had passed.

Twenty years ago, Xiao Bai had already sensed that Han Li had successfully closed his cultivation, but he had been waiting for him to emerge, yet Han Li hadn't come out. Xiao Bai's heart was filled with doubts.

"He should have already succeeded in his cultivation, by right, he should have come out already?"

"Why is it taking so long? It's really making me anxious!"

"Could something unexpected have happened? No, no, Master has a good fortune, how could something unexpected happen?"

"Is it that he's had some extraordinary encounter? Yes, it should be that... but time is running out..."

Xiao Bai paced back and forth, his face sometimes filled with anxiety, sometimes with confusion, as he asked the Fire Bird repeatedly.

He wasn't worried about Han Li's safety, because through the connection between them, he knew Han Li was fine. He was worried that if he spent too much time here, he might not be able to rescue Jintong before he had to return to the Barbarian Plains.

The Fire Bird, of course, didn't know, and could only shake its head in a helpless manner.

Xiao Bai's mind was filled with doubts, and he wanted to enter the Flower Branch Space to take a look, but he was afraid of disturbing Han Li's cultivation, so he could only endure it.

...

Inside the cave, Han Li was staring intently at the void below him, where a golden tree forest had formed. The forest was now very solid, and the time law power it contained was very dense.

Han Li's spiritual domain had already reached the level of the Creation Realm.

"It's actually only taken two thousand years..." Han Li was very satisfied with this result.

He knew that condensing a spiritual domain was a very time-consuming and laborious process. Normally, it would take tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years to reach the initial stage of the Creation Realm.

Han Li guessed that his spiritual domain had been able to enter the Creation Realm so quickly because of the high level of his time law cultivation, and also because his five time law objects each had their own five elements properties.

All things in the world came from the harmony of yin and yang, and conformed to the five elements. His five time law objects could combine the five elements, giving him a unique advantage in condensing the "Creation" realm.

Han Li was delighted, and his gaze swept over the other time law objects, but he could only say to himself, "This time is limited, and I can only wait for another opportunity to create the rest of them..."

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his hand, intending to retract his spiritual domain.

But just then, a strange noise came from the Flower Branch Space, and Han Li's heart was filled with doubt. He looked in the direction of the sound.

He saw that a blue light had suddenly appeared in the spiritual medicine garden, flying towards him, and had crashed into the golden tree forest in his spiritual domain.

Han Li looked closely, and saw that the object that had flown into the golden tree forest was a strange tree with lush branches.

"This is... the Two Lives Tree?" Han Li's heart was shocked, and he recognized that the strange tree was the new tree he had cultivated from the Two Lives Tree's broken roots, which he had obtained from the True Speech Sect's ancient ruins.

But in his memory, the Two Lives Tree grew very slowly, yet the tree in front of him seemed to have already matured.

Just as he was wondering, a shocking scene appeared.

The blue tree had fallen into the forest, and had begun to grow roots into the ground. The blue light on its surface began to fluctuate, and it seemed to be transforming into a blue tree forest.

In the midst of the light, the blue tree forest began to overlap with the golden tree forest, and a series of fine threads began to connect them, as if they were merging into one.

"Is this the fusion of law objects and spiritual domains to form a real realm? Isn't this a phenomenon that only appears in the Heaven Man Realm?" Han Li's heart was shocked, and he couldn't help but exclaim.

The Heaven Man Realm's spiritual domain was able to surpass the Creation Realm and the Transformation Realm because it could combine with law objects that had the same attributes as its own power, allowing it to make the spiritual domain real.

Once the spiritual domain could be made real, its power would naturally increase, and it would be in a position of suppression over the previous two realms.

A cultivator in their own Heaven Man Realm spiritual domain was like a master of a small heaven and earth, and would be unbeatable when facing enemies who entered their domain.
