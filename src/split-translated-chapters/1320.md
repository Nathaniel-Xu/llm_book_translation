Heavenly Court, Heavenly Time Peak.

This place was surrounded by golden auspicious clouds, layer upon layer, changing unpredictably.

Above the golden clouds stood a massive stone stele, emitting golden rays of light that flowed ceaselessly.

On the stele were inscribed golden characters, seemingly names of people, large and small.

These golden names were arranged in order of size, from top to bottom.

The top few names were the largest, among which was Han Li's name, ranked third.

At this moment, Han Li's name on the stele suddenly shone with a brilliant golden light, rapidly growing larger, and suddenly leapt forward, pushing aside the two names in front of it, occupying the first position.

In the void in front of the stele, a wheelchair-bound white-robed man suddenly appeared.

 Beside the wheelchair-bound man stood a slender youth, dressed in a golden long robe, with golden skin, looking extremely noble.

The youth's eyes were the most striking, flashing with a dreamlike golden light, making it impossible to gaze directly at him, as if transcending the laws of heaven and earth.

"How is this possible? Han Li has actually reached the late stage of the Mahayana Realm!" The golden-robed youth saw the change on the stele and revealed an expression of incredulity, exclaiming in shock.

"It seems that this Han Li has taken the lead after all." The wheelchair-bound man looked at the stele, smiling lightly.

"I am incompetent, please forgive me, Your Majesty!" The golden-robed youth's face changed, and he immediately kowtowed.

"Han Li has inherited the mantle of Miro, and his cultivation speed is faster than yours, which is normal. However, I have also invested effort in cultivating you, so don't disappoint me." The wheelchair-bound man said indifferently, then his figure flashed and disappeared.

The golden-robed youth remained kowtowing on the ground for a long time, waiting for the wheelchair-bound man's aura to disappear completely before daring to stand up.

"Han Li, Han Li..." He looked at Han Li's name on the stele, his face filled with a ferocious expression, and then his figure flashed and disappeared.

...

In the secret chamber of the Nameless Mountain Range, the golden light projected from the golden ocean inside had not stopped, and the time law's power continued to pour into Han Li's body.

The surrounding void's heavenly aura also surged in, gathering with a loud rumble.

Han Li's 1800 acupoints and 1320 immortal acupoints flashed ceaselessly, his body seeming like a bottomless pit, able to contain all the time laws and heavenly aura that came in.

His immortal energy soared rapidly, and the time law's power inside him continued to increase explosively. The time law's crystal threads did not increase in number, but each thread emitted a golden glow, growing thicker and more robust.

A massive aura burst forth from Han Li's body, causing the secret chamber to shake violently, as if it could not withstand this power.

The chamber's walls cracked, and the cracks grew larger, on the verge of collapse.

At this moment, a golden light shot out from Han Li's body, sweeping across the nearby walls.

The cracks on the walls suddenly shrank, and after a few breaths, they disappeared completely.

But Han Li's aura continued to burst forth, soon causing the walls to crack again, and the golden light restored them.

This cycle repeated, and a day and night passed in the blink of an eye.

Han Li's entire body was surrounded by a golden glow, making it difficult to gaze directly at him.

His physical body now seemed half-transparent, with 1800 time law crystal threads visible.

These crystal threads had grown thicker by more than ten times, wrapping around his body like chains, looking unbreakable.

Han Li's aura was like a boundless ocean, rivaling that of the Bone Emperor, but still inferior to the unfathomable Wheel of Reincarnation's master.

At this moment, the golden ocean above his head suddenly fluctuated, and the golden light pouring down disappeared.

The shattered void quickly healed, and the secret chamber returned to calm.

The golden light on Han Li's body rapidly dissipated, and he slowly fell to the ground.

He now had no aura of strength, and his immortal energy and time law's power were gone, making him seem like an ordinary, unpracticed mortal.

The secret chamber's formation had long since collapsed, leaving nothing behind.

The Earthly Corpse, which had been attached to the Earthly Immortal puppet, had gained its freedom, but it did not move, standing quietly in the corner of the chamber.

The Earthly Corpse looked at Han Li, and a hint of fear flashed in its eyes.

Just a day and night ago, it could still exchange blows with Han Li, talking and laughing with him.

But now, Han Li had undergone a heaven-shaking transformation, seeming like an ordinary person at first glance. However, when the Earthly Corpse probed with its divine sense, it felt that Han Li's body was like a vast, unfathomable ocean, and it could not see through his depth. Instead, it felt as if it was being drawn in, and it quickly withdrew its divine sense.

"Congratulations, fellow daoist, on advancing to the late stage of the Mahayana Realm and achieving great success in the time law." The Earthly Corpse bowed.

"I must thank you for your assistance, fellow daoist." Han Li opened his eyes, smiling faintly.

"With your divine abilities, even if I didn't leave willingly, I would have been forced out eventually. What assistance could I have possibly provided?" The Earthly Corpse shook its head, speaking calmly.

"This Earthly Corpse body was carefully refined by me, and it should be quite suitable for you." Han Li looked at the Earthly Corpse puppet.

"It's very suitable, thank you for finding such a good body for me." The Earthly Corpse looked at its own body, smiling with joy.

"Fellow daoist Han, I will take my leave. Although it's not a great merit, it's still a bit of a favor to you, as it saves you some trouble. I have a request, and I hope you can grant it." The Earthly Corpse looked at Han Li, bowing.
"Speak," Han Li said, not surprised.

Earlier, Shan Shi had left of his own accord, and Han Li had guessed that this would happen.

"Friend Han, now that you've advanced to the late stage of the Mahayana, I suppose you'll be heading to the Reincarnation Hall soon, right? You're incredibly powerful now, so you shouldn't be afraid, but I don't want to get involved in your conflicts," Shan Shi said.

"You want to leave?" Han Li's eyes flickered, and he asked.

"Friend Han, don't worry, I won't join the Reincarnation Hall or the Heavenly Court, and I won't become your enemy. From your previous actions, I've found my own path, and I want to continue walking this road, traveling throughout the True Immortal Realm, benefiting the people of the world, and pursuing the ultimate goal of goodness," Shan Shi said, his eyes shining with clarity.

"Since you have this desire, I'll grant it," Han Li said after a moment of silence, nodding.

"Then I'll take my leave, friend Han. Farewell," Shan Shi said, overjoyed, and he slightly bowed to Han Li.

Before he finished speaking, a flash of golden light appeared on his body, and his figure vanished into thin air.

Han Li stood silently, not minding Shan Shi's departure.

It was better that Shan Shi had left, as he would have had to be constantly on guard if he had stayed.

Han Li quickly closed his eyes again, sensing the changes in his cultivation realm. A look of surprise and delight slowly appeared on his face.

Han Li had previously guessed that advancing to the late stage of the Mahayana would bring about a huge change in his power, and now that he had actually advanced, he realized that his previous considerations had been too simple.

He had now entered a completely new realm, and everything around him seemed different from before.

Han Li stretched out his hand, touching the empty space beside him, without using any spiritual energy, law energy, or physical energy.

With a soft "whoosh," the empty space seemed to ripple and burst open, revealing a spatial cavity over ten zhang in diameter within the secret room.

Spatial fragments shot out from the cavity, flying towards the walls of the secret room.

With a thought, the fragments stopped in mid-air, as if trapped by an invisible force.

Han Li looked at his hand, his face filled with surprise.

He felt as though he had been possessed by a mysterious power, and he had a sense of control over the world around him, as if he had become an all-powerful being who could easily control the heavens and the earth.

Han Li slowly activated this power, gazing around him, and the entire Xuanwu Sacred Realm appeared before his eyes, with every location visible to him, ten times clearer than before.

Shan Shi appeared in a desolate city, observing the situation.

He had previously been in a desolate city, where Li Hai was entertaining guests.

Not only could he see the Xuanwu Sacred Realm, but also the surrounding realms and even the lower planes, as if he were observing the lines on his palm.

"Could this be the power of the Heavenly Dao?" Han Li's face lit up with surprise, and he muttered to himself.

He had read about it in ancient texts, that cultivating a law to its peak would allow one to communicate with the Heavenly Dao, and receive the power of the Heavenly Dao, which would grant him the ability to wield devastating power.

But this realm was only achievable by the Dao Ancestors, and he was only in the late stage of the Mahayana, so how could he be communicating with the Heavenly Dao?

Han Li's thoughts whirled, and he raised his hand, slapping the empty space.

The void above him trembled violently, and a massive golden palm appeared, covering the entire void, and then slapped downwards.

A terrifying power erupted from the golden palm, shattering the surrounding space and energy storms, reducing them to nothingness.

The void itself shattered, revealing a massive black hole, emitting a terrifying devouring power, absorbing everything around it.

But in an instant, the golden palm wiped out the black hole, and it disappeared without a trace.

The golden palm also vanished, and the void slowly recovered.

In the secret room, Han Li withdrew his hand, a look of joy on his face.

Through his previous experiment, he had confirmed that he could indeed communicate with the Heavenly Dao, and as for why, it was probably because he had cultivated the three ultimate laws, which were different from ordinary laws.

With his current power, he was no longer afraid of facing the Dao Ancestors.

Han Li's eyes suddenly widened, and he realized that the Reincarnation Hall Master and the Demon Master, despite being only in the Mahayana realm, were incredibly powerful, surpassing ordinary Dao Ancestors, and even the Heavenly Court feared them.

But as long as he continued to cultivate, reaching the peak of the Mahayana, he might not be weaker than the Reincarnation Hall Master and the Demon Master.

Han Li gazed forward, his heart filled with ambition.

He had finally reached the pinnacle of the immortal realm, the true pinnacle.

"Wait for me, Wan'er, I'll soon rescue you!" Han Li said to himself.

He took a deep breath, suppressing his excitement, and sat down again, cross-legged.

Although he had advanced to the late stage of the Mahayana, his realm was still unstable, and he needed to consolidate it further.

Han Li's thoughts moved, and he opened his spiritual domain, activating the Time-Space Heavenly Array, which accelerated the flow of time within his domain by ten million times.

His time law had made another great leap forward, and his ability to accelerate time had improved further.

Not only that, but Han Li's control over the heavenly energy had also increased, and with a single gesture, he drew in the heavenly energy, pouring it into the Time-Space Heavenly Array, maintaining its operation.

The Time-Space Heavenly Array's consumption of sacred stones slowed down dramatically.

Han Li sat cross-legged, surrounded by a brilliant golden light, which enveloped his body.
