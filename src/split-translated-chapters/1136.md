Han Li, I have something I don't understand, you're now a thorn in the eye of the Heavenly Court, how can you still dare to go to the Great Jin Yuan Xian Domain?" Lan Yan asked, finding Han Li's actions difficult to understand.

"You can't think of things that the Heavenly Court might not have thought of. There's a saying, isn't there? The most dangerous place is often the safest place." Han Li smiled and replied.

Lan Yan naturally knew this was a evasive statement, but seeing Han Li unwilling to reveal the true reason, he tactfully stopped asking.

At this time, Lichi Ma suddenly ran over, saying:

"Kid, this time we've been through thick and thin together, Old Ancestor thinks you're pretty good, consider joining us in returning to the Barbarian Domain?"

"Thanks for the recognition, but I still have some things to take care of, so I won't be traveling with you." Han Li smiled and cupped his hands.

"Alright! Take this, if you need anything in the future, just come to the Barbarian Domain to find me." Lichi Ma suddenly raised his hoof, and a snow-white light flashed out, landing in front of Han Li.

Han Li picked it up and took a look, discovering a palm-sized round scale, snow-white and covered in layered water patterns, emitting a fierce and savage aura.

"Thanks." Han Li briefly examined it before putting it away.

Then, he bid farewell to Lan Yan and the others, and flew off.

Once their auras had completely disappeared into the distance, Lichi Ma, who had been gazing into the distance, suddenly flashed his eyes, and his entire body shone with snow-white light. Countless white air currents swirled around him, enveloping him completely.

Fox Three watched in amazement, his face full of puzzlement.

Only to see Lichi Ma gradually stand up straight, his body shrinking, and transforming into a human shape.

After all the light and air currents dissipated, a tall, handsome young man appeared, wearing a white robe, with snow-white long hair tied up in a high bun, looking elegant and extraordinary.

"Earlier, I was presumptuous, offending the Young Master, please forgive me." The young man said, bowing and cupping his hands.

"Uncle Liu, no need to be like this, earlier I was the one who instructed you, you did nothing wrong." Lichi Ma, now in his human form, walked over and helped Liu up, saying.

"What...what's going on here?" Fox Three was completely stunned, his face full of shock.

"Let's go, I'll explain on the way." Lichi Ma smiled and waved his hand.

As he did, a snow-white light flashed out, and a three-layered snow-white tower ship appeared out of thin air, its upper floors adorned with intricate carvings, looking magnificent and luxurious.

The three of them flew up and landed on the tower ship.

Without seeing Lichi Ma do anything, the tower ship was lifted up by a series of white air currents, transforming into a white flash of light, and disappearing into the distance.

...

Three years had passed.

In the northern outskirts of the Jin Yuan Mountain Range, a dark red spirit boat sped across the sky above a winding river.

The spirit boat was not small, with two layers of pavilions built on top.

At this time, Jiao San, wearing a long blue dress, stood at the railing of the second floor, gazing out at the empty space.

"Master Huai Yang, now that we've left the Jin Yuan Mountain Range, I'll need you to propel the spirit boat. I'll be closing up for a while." Jiao San said, looking back.

"Don't worry, Jiao San, I'll take care of it." Huai Yang, standing on the spirit boat's deck, replied.

"Thanks." Jiao San cupped her hands and turned to enter the pavilion.

As she did, she raised her hand and pointed at the air above her head.

A dark red light shot out from her finger, striking a dark red token suspended above her head.

The light entered the token, which began to spin rapidly, and a layer of light expanded out, enveloping the entire pavilion.

Jiao San saw this and sat down cross-legged, her hands forming a strange hand seal, and her mouth began to chant.

Suddenly, complex symbols lit up beneath her, like red ribbons flowing out from her body, then rising up the light curtain, circulating and repeating.

Jiao San was surrounded by a hazy light, her body becoming indistinct, as if shrouded in multiple layers of illusions.

Her eyes flashed red, and her pupils constricted, her gaze becoming empty and hollow, as if her soul had been extracted, leaving behind an empty shell.

But then, a smile appeared on her lips, and her eyes closed, plunging her into darkness.

When she opened her eyes again, the scene before her had changed, and she found herself in a strange, gray space.

The space was empty, except for a winding river flowing through it.
Jiao San's figure seemed to be floating in mid-air, her hands moving as if she were swimming through the air, propelling herself forward with a gentle motion. She was hovering above one of the dark red rivers, moving upstream.

There were five rivers in total, each with its own unique color and scenery. Some had turbulent waters, while others were calm and serene. One of the silver rivers had a gentle current, with small water droplets and glowing orbs floating within it, as if containing images that flickered and danced.

Jiao San only dared to glance at it briefly, not daring to linger her gaze, lest she be drawn into the river by an unseen force.

She continued upstream, eventually seeing all the rivers converge into a single source. The river was murky and turbulent, with a dark red stone bridge spanning its width.

The bridge was smooth and natural, resembling a crystal stone platform. The river flowed beneath it, dividing into six separate streams.

Jiao San's eyes fell upon the bridge, and her brow furrowed in surprise. She spotted a woman in black, sitting on the riverbank with her back to Jiao San, her feet submerged in the dark red river. The woman's face was hidden, and Jiao San couldn't see her features.

Jiao San didn't dare to look more closely, as there was a figure standing on the bridge, casting a shadow over the six streams. The man was dressed in a thick, heavy cloak, with a large hat on his head, and a fishing rod in his hand. He seemed to be fishing in the murky waters.

Jiao San's figure floated above the bridge, but she couldn't descend, remaining suspended in mid-air.

"Greetings, Lord," Jiao San said, her voice solemn and respectful.

The man on the bridge was none other than the famous Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth.

"What news do you bring?" Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth asked, without turning to face Jiao San.

Jiao San recounted the events of the past, telling him everything that had transpired.

When she finished, Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth remained silent for a moment, then spoke, "Stone Empty Ink is no ordinary person. You must be cautious in your dealings with him."

Jiao San frowned, "Do you think he's pretending to be mad?"

Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth shook his head, "Whether he's pretending or not, as long as he doesn't target us, it's of no concern. However, we must assist him in finding his wife and child. All resources within the temple are at your disposal."

Jiao San nodded, "Yes, Lord."

Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth continued, "Now that we've found what we were looking for, we can set our plans in motion. This should keep the Heavenly Court busy for a while."

Jiao San replied, "I'll begin making arrangements as soon as I return to the temple."

The two fell silent, until Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth suddenly spoke up, "What do you think of him, based on your own judgment?"

Jiao San replied, "From my interactions with him, I believe he's exceptional in terms of strategy, courage, and abilities. He will certainly be a valuable asset in the future. I hope to include him in our plans."

Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth nodded, "You may proceed as you see fit."

Jiao San bowed, "Yes, Lord."

Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth continued, "You must have used up a significant amount of your law crystal threads to use the Wheel of Rebirth's secret technique. This will serve as compensation for your losses."

He flicked his wrist, and the fishing rod in his hand jerked upwards, pulling out a dark red crystal thread from the water. A dark red glow emanated from it, and Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth plucked it out of the water.

He manipulated the glow, transforming it into a dark red pearl. With a flick of his finger, the pearl shot towards Jiao San, striking her brow and disappearing into her body.

Jiao San's figure flew backwards, her eyes blacking out as she lost consciousness.

In the inner chamber of the dark red spirit boat, Jiao San's eyes snapped open, and she sat up, gasping for air. Her body was drenched in sweat, and her eyes were wide with shock.

As she regained her composure, Jiao San touched her brow, feeling a slight pain, but also a cool, soothing sensation. She sensed the presence of the Wheel of Rebirth's law within her, and her heart was filled with joy.

However, her mind soon turned to the mysterious woman sitting on the riverbank, and she felt a surge of curiosity. Who was that woman, and what was her relationship with Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth?
