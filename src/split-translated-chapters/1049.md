Here is the translated text:

"There's nothing strange about it, the five elements have a natural relationship of mutual generation and restraint. Metal can generate water, and in this metal force field, my water attribute spiritual domain is naturally stronger by three parts. Those metal beasts, if they stay in my spiritual domain, will be absorbed of their metal attribute force, and naturally will be unable to resist me," Lan Yuansu said calmly.

"I see, thank you for the lesson," Han Li nodded and said.

"In this metal force field, I have the advantage of the terrain, and I have an unbeatable position from the start. Han Dao friend, are you really not willing to surrender?" Lan Yuansu looked at Han Li's fearless expression and couldn't help but ask.

"If you were a Daluo realm cultivator, relying on this terrain advantage, you might have the qualifications to speak like that," Han Li sneered and said.

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward, and without using his spiritual energy, he charged forward with his physical strength.

Han Li didn't move, but as soon as he did, he felt like he was facing a vast ocean, with waves crashing against him, pushing him back and preventing him from advancing.

He coldly snorted, and quietly activated the Tianxia Zhenyu technique, his body's xuanqiao lit up one after another, and his star power surged out, suddenly breaking through the water attribute law's obstruction, and the distance between him and the Lan siblings narrowed instantly.

"His physical body is incredibly strong, this is not something a Taiyi cultivator should possess," Lan Yuansu's expression changed, and he exclaimed in surprise.

"What's the use of having a strong physical body, let's see how you handle my Water Yuan Slash," Lan Yan had been holding back her anger, and now she coldly snorted, her body glowing with a blue-green light as she charged towards Han Li.

Her body moved within Lan Yuansu's spiritual domain, and was completely unaffected, instantly flashing in front of Han Li.

She twisted her wrist, and the three crystal stones on her curved scythe lit up, a powerful water attribute law's force surged out, the scythe's blade suddenly grew larger, and in mid-air, it drew a circular arc, slashing towards Han Li.

"No, retreat quickly..." Lan Yuansu suddenly remembered something, and cried out in alarm.

But it was too late, Han Li's true word treasure wheel reversed, and the flow of time accelerated, his speed surpassing Lan Yan's by a large margin.

His body brushed past the edge of Lan Yan's scythe, and he reached out with his hand, aiming for her throat.

Lan Yan had no chance to resist, and was caught by Han Li's hand.

"Ha ha ha..." a series of clear and crisp laughter came from Lan Yan's throat.

Han Li immediately felt something was off, and when he tried to release his hand, it was too late.

His palm felt a cold and icy sensation, a blue-green light burst out from Lan Yan's body, instantly covering Han Li, and turning him into a crystal blue ice sculpture.

And the "Lan Yan" he was holding onto also turned into an ice sculpture.

On the other side, Lan Yuansu's body glowed with a light, and Lan Yan's figure reappeared.

"Brother, I knew he cultivated the time law, I wouldn't have been so reckless," Lan Yan smiled and said.

"I didn't expect you to hide it from me, and even made me worry," Lan Yuansu sighed and said.

"It's good that we caught him, brother, hurry up and seal him completely, my Extreme Cold Ice Crystal can only hold him for a short time," Lan Yan's smile disappeared, and she urged.

As soon as she finished speaking, a somewhat muffled voice came from outside: "A short time, Lan Dao friend, you're overestimating yourself."

Immediately after, a loud "bang" sound was heard.

Han Li's body erupted with countless golden electric lights, the blue ice crystal exploded, and his figure reappeared.

"How is this possible?" Lan Yan exclaimed in surprise.

Ordinary Taiyi cultivators, if sealed in this Extreme Cold Ice Crystal, would have their spiritual energy frozen, and would be unable to move, even if they were at the peak of the Taiyi realm, they could only struggle a bit, but Han Li was different.

She didn't know that Han Li had opened up over 900 xuanqiao, even if his spiritual energy was frozen, his physical strength and star power were enough to break through the seal.

Han Li coldly smiled, and without saying a word, he turned his wrist, and a layer of pale golden spiritual domain expanded, just enough to envelop Lan Yuansu's spiritual domain.

Lan Yan and Lan Yuansu felt the pressure of the time spiritual domain, and their expressions changed.

"This person is more troublesome than we imagined, don't have any illusions, only by using that technique can we have a chance to win," Lan Yuansu said gravely.

Lan Yan's eyes narrowed, and she nodded.

Then, she saw her hand collect the curved scythe, and she snapped her fingers.

A spiritual domain with a slightly lighter color, and a bit of white, expanded, and when it approached Lan Yuansu's spiritual domain, a strange attractive force appeared, and finally, with a flash of light, they merged.

After the two spiritual domains merged, a cold and strange feeling came from within.

Han Li, who was inside, felt like he was being pressed down by a huge weight, and couldn't breathe.

"Spiritual domain fusion..."

He swallowed his saliva, and his eyebrows furrowed in surprise.
Only the blue-colored ice sculpture stood in front of Han Li, its facial features ambiguous, resembling both Lan Yuan and Lan Cai. 

Han Li hesitated, and suddenly the wind howled, and a loud crashing sound erupted.

Outside his body, four beams of cold light rose from the ground, condensing into four blue-colored ice sculptures identical to the first one.

The five ice sculptures stood expressionless, their mouths open, emitting a low growl.

As they opened their mouths, the surrounding space temperature plummeted, and visible white cold air surged out, rushing towards Han Li from all directions.

The air was filled with cracking sounds, and crystal lights began to refract through the space.

Han Li's eyes flashed, and a layer of white frost instantly formed on his eyebrows.

His expression changed slightly, and he raised his hand, summoning eighteen Qingtong Huicong swords that floated in front of him. The swords' surfaces crackled with energy, emitting golden lightning that formed into golden lightning balls, which seemed to be on the verge of exploding.

However, a whirlwind swept past, and the white cold air rushed in, freezing Han Li and his Qingtong Huicong swords in place.

The golden lightning balls still crackled with energy, but they were also frozen in place.

Han Li's heart sank, and he was surprised to find that his spiritual sea seemed to be infiltrated by cold air, making his divine sense feel numb.

"Brother, we can only capture him with the power of the Ling domain fusion, but we can't maintain it for long. What should we do to bring him back to the Jiuyuan Pavilion?" one of the ice sculptures asked, its voice devoid of emotion.

"The sect didn't say we had to bring him back alive. Finding the Palms of Heaven is the priority. Since he's so difficult to deal with, let's just kill him and take his divine soul back," another ice sculpture replied, its voice equally cold and inhuman.

"Should we use the Xuanbing Zhanyuan sword?" another ice sculpture asked.

"Kill!" the remaining two ice sculptures chimed in unison.

The five ice sculptures began to form a formation, their hands weaving intricate patterns.

A blue light surged above Han Li's head, and a circular symbol appeared, emitting a powerful cold energy. A blue ice sword protruded from the symbol, its blade half-exposed.

The cold energy in the space increased exponentially, and a terrifying pressure descended from above.

"This is... a high-grade immortal artifact?" Han Li felt the power and his heart skipped a beat.

The sword hadn't fully emerged, and yet it already possessed such immense power. If it were to be fully unleashed, even a Da Luo cultivator might not be able to withstand it. No wonder it required Lan Yuan and Lan Cai to join forces and summon it with a formation.

Han Li's internal immortal energy was almost completely frozen, and even his starlight energy was unable to circulate. The Qingtong Huicong swords were also sealed, and he was unable to break free from the extreme cold.

The battle inside the stone door was intense, but the people outside could only hear the sounds of fighting and feel the occasional powerful shockwaves. They couldn't see the situation inside.

"When should we go in?" Su Cai asked via transmission.

"There's no need to rush. Let's wait and see. A battle of this scale is not something we can intervene in. We might get caught in the crossfire. It's better to wait until the fighting stops, and then we can go in," Jing Liu replied via transmission.

Just then, a powerful cold energy burst through the seal, shattering the golden energy barrier and spreading outside the stone door.

The several Wu You Pavilion cultivators who were too close were instantly frozen, turning into ice sculptures. They didn't even have time to react before they were killed.

"What's going on?" the crowd was shocked and retreated from the stone door.

Su Cai and Jing Liu exchanged a glance, their expressions also changing.

"Jing Dao friend, how come there's no news from the people who went in, even after so long? Could something have happened?" Fu Gu Zhu, the master of Qing Su Valley, asked, his expression changing.

"I don't know what's going on inside," Jing Liu replied, his brow furrowed.

As he spoke, another explosion rocked the stone door, and a wave of intense heat surged out, forcing the crowd to retreat dozens of feet.

"What's happening?"

At that moment, Han Li, still frozen in place, was surrounded by silver flames that seemed to be a fire dragon. The flames emitted a terrifying heat that seemed to be on the verge of explosion.

A sharp whistling sound pierced the air, and a silver flame bird with seven-colored flames on its head burst out of the flames, flying straight towards the Xuanbing Zhanyuan sword.

A massive explosion rocked the space, and the blue cold lights on the sword transformed into countless thin threads that merged with the flames, creating a massive snow-white mist that obscured the entire space.

"Is this... a high-grade immortal artifact?" Han Li felt the power and his heart skipped a beat.

The sword hadn't fully emerged, and yet it already possessed such immense power. If it were to be fully unleashed, even a Da Luo cultivator might not be able to withstand it. No wonder it required Lan Yuan and Lan Cai to join forces and summon it with a formation.
