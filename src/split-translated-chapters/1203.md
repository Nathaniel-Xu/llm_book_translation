Qu Lian's shoulder took the brunt of the sword, and his shoulder was stained with blood. He let out a muffled groan and his body began to glow with a golden light. Despite the pressure, he managed to stand up again, and his wound began to heal.

The one controlling the giant sword was a short, black-robed man. Seeing Qu Lian's recovery, he let out a cold snort and manipulated the sword to strike down again. The sword descended heavily, causing Qu Lian's body to tremble, but he remained standing.

"Haha, is this all you've got?" Qu Lian laughed mockingly.

Chi Meng, who had been watching, sneered and said, "I've heard that the body of a Xi Jin immortal is indestructible, but it seems that's not the case."

Chi Meng waved his hand, and a swarm of fire ants crawled onto Qu Lian's body, leaving behind a trail of burns and black scars.

Qu Lian glanced at the ants before ignoring them. His arms shook, and a golden light burst forth, sending the ants flying and forcing the giant sword to retreat.

Qu Lian stomped his foot, and a golden ripple spread out, propelling him into the air. He attempted to escape, but a dark fog coalesced into a giant ghost, which swallowed him whole.

Inside the ghost's mouth, Qu Lian felt his mind grow cloudy, and before he could react, gray, translucent chains shot out from all directions, piercing his body. The chains seemed to freeze his spiritual energy, rendering him unable to move.

The other attackers closed in, unleashing a flurry of flames, swords, and fists. Qu Lian's face twisted in pain, but he endured the attacks, seemingly unscathed.

"This insect's body is indeed formidable," the tall, dark-robed man said, his voice hoarse. "Let me destroy his divine sense, and even if he becomes a fool, he'll still be of use."

He produced a black, short flute and raised it to his lips. Han Li watched from a distance, sensing that something was off.

The flute let out a sudden, urgent sound, and black, swirling symbols appeared on its surface. The sound waves radiated outward, sweeping across the area.

Qu Lian's calm demeanor faltered, and his face contorted in agony. He felt as though an invisible saw was tearing through his divine sense, attempting to cleave it in two.

The sound waves intensified, and the saw disappeared, replaced by countless, sharp drills that bored into Qu Lian's divine sense.

"Ahh..." Qu Lian's anguished cry echoed through the air.

Han Li, who had been prepared for this, felt the sound waves' effects, but his divine sense was strong enough to withstand them. Chi Meng, who was also affected, glared at the flute player.

Only Xiao Bai, who had recently inherited the power of the Mo Ye Pixiu, was unable to resist the sound waves. His body trembled, and his eyes widened in pain.

Chi Meng's eyes flashed red, and a vertical pupil appeared, shooting out two dark red beams that struck Han Li and Xiao Bai's foreheads.

Han Li's mind cleared, and Xiao Bai's pain subsided.

"Ah, Han Li, I've been searching for you everywhere," Chi Meng said, his voice dripping with malice. "I didn't expect you to deliver yourself to me."

Chi Meng's figure appeared above Han Li, Xiao Bai, and Chi Meng, who had been hiding until now. Han Li brought the other two out of hiding, and they hovered in mid-air, surrounded by a dark red, spiritual domain.

"That's quite a hassle, Chi Meng," Han Li said, smiling fearlessly.

Chi Meng's eyes narrowed, sensing the changes in Han Li's aura. "Han Li, you've... Ah, never mind. You're just a foolish mortal."

Lan Yan, who had been watching from a distance, felt a pang of surprise. "Han Li, you..."

Chi Meng's gaze swept over Han Li, and her expression changed. "You've reached the Da Luo realm? That's impossible!"
The great Luo realm is nothing but a child who has not yet beheaded the three corpses. This time, I will not let you escape from my hands again. Chi Meng laughed lightly.

Unlike other realms, the great Luo realm can advance one layer with each beheading of a corpse, and with three corpses beheaded, one can cross the difficult-to-surpass heavenly chasm and achieve the Daozu realm.

Each beheading is extremely dangerous, and if successful, one's strength will increase significantly. The difference between each small realm is no different from the original great realm.

With their own people numerous and powerful, Chi Meng naturally had complete confidence in taking down Han Li. The only thing to be cautious of was the strange and sudden escape technique he had used before.

Chi Meng drank a sound, and with a wave of her hand, a crimson glow burst forth, forming a massive spherical light screen that expanded to cover an area of hundreds of li.

Han Li and the others felt the air around them suddenly become scorching hot, and they were already trapped in Chi Meng's spiritual domain.

The surroundings were filled with flames, and eight firefalls descended from the sky, while the ground turned into a lake of magma.

The air around them seemed to boil, and the ground within a thousand li was scorched, with all the lakes and rivers evaporating, leaving behind a trail of cracks and fissures.

Xiaobai felt his mouth dry, as if the spiritual energy of the surroundings was being drained by the scorching power of the spiritual domain.

"This woman doesn't seem to be a kind person," Xiaobai said.

"It looks like last time we fought, she didn't use her full strength," Han Li said, frowning.

"Xitang Elder, you and Swordqiu Elder will take care of that Jinxin Immortal. The rest of you, come with me and take down this person," Chi Meng ordered.

The tall, dark-robed man who cultivated the yin soul law, and the short, dark-robed man who controlled the golden sword, both responded in unison.

The other two black-robed men flashed towards Chi Meng's side.

"Ti Hu, go and rescue Qu Lin," Han Li instructed.

"Okay," Ti Hu replied, and was about to leave.

"You think you can just come and go as you please in my spiritual domain?" Chi Meng's eyebrows rose in anger.

With a wave of her hand, the magma lake below erupted, and a hundred-zhang-tall fire giant slowly rose from the depths, holding a massive fire sword, blocking Ti Hu's path.

Ti Hu saw this and snorted coldly.

With a flick of her wrist, a black ghost claw appeared in her palm, and with a swift motion, she tore through the void, slicing the fire giant into several pieces.

She glanced at the ghost claw in her hand, which she had just obtained, and nodded in satisfaction.

The fragmented fire giant reformed into magma, flowing back into the magma lake.

"You think this fire spirit is rare? I have as many as I want in my spiritual domain," Chi Meng sneered.

As soon as she finished speaking, the magma lake erupted even more violently, and fire giants emerged one after another, wielding fire swords, charging towards Han Li and the others.

Han Li's hand turned lightly, and a layer of golden light screen unfolded, forming a pale golden spiritual domain that merged with Chi Meng's fire spiritual domain.

Inside the spiritual domain, time flow accelerated, and the fire giants' sword-wielding speed slowed.

Ti Hu flew out, and with another wave of her ghost claw, dozens of black claw marks appeared, slicing through the fire giants once again.

Her figure flashed by, and she was about to head towards Qu Lin.

But just as she was about to pass by, a magma dragon suddenly burst forth from a hanging magma waterfall, its jaws wide open, biting down towards Ti Hu.

Ti Hu was not afraid, and with another wave of her ghost claw, she sliced through the magma dragon.

However, the magma dragon did not dissolve like the previous fire giants, but instead, its severed body reformed in a flash of red light, continuing to bite down towards Ti Hu.

"You don't need to worry, just go forward," Han Li's voice suddenly sounded in her ear.

Ti Hu heard this and did not continue to attack, but instead charged forward.

Just as the magma dragon's jaws were about to close around her, a sound of rushing water suddenly erupted, and a golden river burst forth from the ground, flowing into the magma dragon's mouth.

The magma dragon's body froze, emitting white smoke.

Ti Hu took advantage of the water's momentum and charged forward, passing through the magma dragon's body, and arriving in front of Qu Lin.

Qu Lin looked at Ti Hu, who had come to rescue him, and Han Li in the distance, a complex expression flashing across his eyes.

Xitang Elder saw this and blew his short flute once more, but the sound waves did not disperse, instead gathering together and charging towards Ti Hu.

Ti Hu's mouth curved into a smile, and she seemed to be thinking about how much her strength would increase if she ate the elder.

Xitang Elder saw her smile and felt a shiver run down his spine, despite his usual composure.
