Han Li walked up the stairs and pushed open the two black doors, saying casually, "Maybe there's a secret manual, but don't expect to find any powerful artifacts. The sect was destroyed, and even the mountain peak where the ancestral hall was located was sliced off by a sword. If there were any powerful artifacts, they would have been taken out to defend against the enemy, not left in the ancestral hall."

The girl looked a bit disappointed, but soon regained her enthusiasm, saying, "But having a secret manual is still great, a high-level cultivation technique is just as valuable. If we can get a few, it won't be a wasted trip."

The doors creaked open, revealing a narrow corridor, and Han Li and the girl walked in. The corridor was empty, with only a large bronze cauldron in the center, covered in green copper rust. Han Li noticed that the cauldron had ancient symbols etched onto it, and the water inside was half full, with a black lotus flower floating on the surface, emitting a strong water attribute law.

"Wow, such a strong water aura..." Hu Xiao Cheng exclaimed, his eyes wide with wonder.

Han Li smiled and said, "Looks like there's still some good stuff here."

He waved his hand, and the cauldron disappeared in a flash of silver light, absorbed into the flower branch cave.

The corridor led to a large hall, which seemed to be a meeting hall, with only a few old and worn-out cushions inside. Han Li and the girl walked through the hall, and behind it was a small courtyard, paved with white stones, looking like a martial arts training ground.

At the end of the courtyard was the most important building in the ancestral hall, a large temple with a red plaque on the door, inscribed with the words "Source Far and Wide".

 Inside the temple, Han Li saw a high nine-layer altar, with many wooden plaques on it, each with a golden pattern, and a list of names of the sect's leaders and elders. Han Li counted them and found that there were over 80 people.

At the bottom of the altar, there were two thick books, bound in gold and jade, with a golden glow surrounding them. Han Li opened them and found that they were not cultivation techniques, but rather a record of the sect's history and a genealogy of the sect's members.

"Originally, this sect was called Qing Jing Sect, and it has been passed down for so long, yet it still suffered from destruction..." Hu Xiao Cheng sighed.

Han Li thought of the Zhen Yan Sect and the Ming Han Xian Fu, and how they had also suffered from unexpected disasters.

He looked up at the highest layer of the altar and saw a plaque with the name "Chang Qing Liu" on it, which seemed unusual. He reached out and grabbed the plaque, and a small jade slip flew out from it.

Han Li took the jade slip and examined it, then put it back in its original place. "It's the sect's secret manual, called 'The Formless Record'."

Hu Xiao Cheng's eyes widened in surprise, and he asked, "Is that the sect's secret manual?"

Han Li nodded and said, "Yes, it's a cultivation technique for water attribute law. Although it's not very useful to me, my clone in the Black Wind Sea might be able to use it."

The two of them searched the ancestral hall again, but found nothing else. Han Li wasn't disappointed, as the jade slip and the bronze cauldron were already worth more than the spirit stones he had paid.

As they sat on the doorstep of the ancestral hall, Han Li asked Hu Xiao Cheng, "When the elder asked you to follow me, did he also ask you to report my movements?"

Hu Xiao Cheng looked surprised, then nodded, "How did you know?"

Han Li smiled and said, "I just guessed. It's not just you, all the guests who come to rent the ancestral hall are assigned someone to follow them, right?"

Hu Xiao Cheng nodded, "Yes, that's right. But usually, it's a beautiful female cultivator who is assigned to follow them. This time, I don't know why, but the elder assigned me to follow you."
Han Li said, "That elder must have looked down on me and didn't believe I could break through the Water Manor's seal, that's why he sent you here."

Hu Xiaocheng's eyes widened in realization. "I see..."

Han Li's expression turned serious. "Remember, others can look down on you, even despise you, but you yourself must not look down on yourself. I've observed that your cultivation talent is not bad, but you're currently stuck at the Nascent Soul stage, likely due to a lack of resources."

Hu Xiaocheng didn't understand why Han Li mentioned this and nodded vaguely.

Han Li flipped his palm, producing a small, crimson ceramic bottle, which he handed to her. "I don't have any low-grade pills that would be suitable for you. The pills in this bottle can only be used when you reach the Congealing Period or later. You can keep it for now and take it when you've made progress in your cultivation."

Hu Xiaocheng was taken aback, hesitating to take the bottle.

Han Li saw her reaction and placed the bottle in her hand, then raised his finger to tap her forehead.

Hu Xiaocheng felt a jolt in her mind, and her body swayed slightly before stabilizing. When she looked up, she saw that Han Li's hand had already withdrawn.

She searched her mind, finding that many characters had appeared, which were none other than the 'Formless Record' cultivation technique.

"Respected guest, you..." Hu Xiaocheng's body shook, and she stood up, unable to speak.

Han Li's expression turned solemn, and he stood up from the doorway. "It won't be long before the Three Rivers Lake is turned upside down."

Hu Xiaocheng changed her tone, asking, "Are you planning to do something big, having rented this Water Manor?"

Han Li replied calmly, "It's not a big deal, just waiting for someone."

Hu Xiaocheng asked, "Is it a friend?"

Han Li's expression turned cold. "An enemy."

Hu Xiaocheng's brow furrowed. "What can I do to help you?"

Han Li shook his head. "I've already removed the mark left on you by the Comb Ridge Sect. You should leave the Comb Ridge Mountain immediately and go as far as you can. Don't come back here again."

Hu Xiaocheng looked puzzled, asking, "Why are you treating me so kindly?"

Han Li looked at her, sighed, and said, "Consider it a compensation for the guilt I feel towards another girl..."

Hu Xiaocheng saw Han Li's somber expression and felt a pang of sadness.

She thought for a moment before bowing deeply. "If I make progress in my cultivation, I'll come back to repay your kindness."

Han Li smiled. "Go."

Hu Xiaocheng bowed again before flying away.

After her figure disappeared, a ripple appeared beside Han Li, and the ghostly figure of Qiuhun emerged.

"Master, aren't you afraid she'll go back to the Comb Ridge Mountain and report you to get a reward?" Qiuhun asked anxiously.

Han Li chuckled. "When have I ever misjudged someone?"

Qiuhun smiled, saying nothing.

"Even if she truly disappoints me, it's not a big deal. I'm not hiding anything, and I'm using my true name, hoping the people from the Immortal Palace will know I'm here."

Qiuhun nodded. "This time, they'll definitely come and not leave."

Han Li patted his hands. "Since we've decided to welcome guests, we should prepare properly and not be rude."

He turned and entered the Ancestral Hall.

Half a month later.

On the Comb Ridge Mountain, a ten-meter-long white flying shuttle hovered in the air, radiating a brilliant light.

Four people stood on the shuttle: a middle-aged man in white robes, followed by an old man with a long nose, a young man in colorful robes, and a black-robed giant.

They were Dongfang Bai and his group.

Below them, on the mountain peak, stood a young man in a green, gauzy robe and a round-faced old man. The young man was the current master of the Comb Ridge Sect, while the old man was the same steward who had received Han Li.

The two men wore slightly obsequious smiles as they gazed up at the four people.

Dongfang Bai looked down at them and asked, "Besides reporting to the Immortal Palace, have you leaked any information about the person staying here?"

The steward and the young master exchanged a glance before responding.
