Han Li stood in mid-air, his hands clasped behind his back, his eyes filled with a nostalgic gaze.

A gentle sea breeze caressed his face, carrying the scent of salt and dampness.

This was the Endless Sea, near the Heavenly South, where he and Ziyu had emerged from a Luohou's belly all those years ago.

The spiritual energy here was extremely scarce, but Han Li's soul felt exceptionally at ease, as if a wandering son had finally returned to his hometown after years of hardship and struggle.

It was a sense of spiritual peace, a feeling that couldn't be replaced by any other place.

Han Li took a few deep breaths, but didn't linger, disappearing from his original location and reappearing in the air above a mountain range.

This mountain range wasn't particularly high, with over a dozen peaks of varying sizes connected together, forming a striking landscape.

The peaks were dotted with checkpoints and hidden passages, with figures in martial attire entering and exiting, all belonging to the Seven Mysteries Sect.

This was the Qixia Mountain, and the Seven Mysteries Sect had taken over this land. Many familiar faces were here, including Mo Tai, Zhang Tie, and his own youthful self.

Near the Seven Mysteries Sect's disciple quarters, a small valley was home to a cold and stern black-clad youth, wielding a long sword as he practiced a sword technique.

This youth was none other than Li Feiyu.

With the Palm of Heaven lost, Han Li took this final opportunity to return to the past, to catch a glimpse of his childhood friend.

Li Feiyu swung his sword, the wind howling, the blade flashing, and the sound of thunder echoing, exuding a powerful aura.

His clothes were soaked in sweat, and his arm was red and swollen, but he didn't stop to rest, continuing to practice with gritted teeth.

Han Li watched this scene, nodding in approval. Back then, Li Feiyu's sword technique was exceptional, and the reason for this was not just the Heaven's Marrow Pill, but also the countless hours of diligent practice.

As he watched, the small bottle in his hand grew dimmer, its remaining power dwindling.

Han Li's gaze shifted, and he raised his hand to seal a technique.

A black light shot out from his fingertips, disappearing into Li Feiyu's brow. Li Feiyu, still practicing, didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, continuing to wield his sword.

Han Li smiled faintly, about to return to reality, when his brow suddenly twitched, and he looked down.

A young black-skinned youth with an ordinary face was walking out of the Divine Hand Valley, his expression dazed, as if lost in thought.

Wasn't this his own youthful self?

Han Li's heart stirred, his gaze extending forward.

A short distance ahead, the Palm of Heaven lay quietly on the ground, waiting to be discovered.

However, judging by the youth's footsteps, it seemed that he would pass by the bottle without noticing it.

Han Li's thoughts turned, and he raised his foot to kick.

The Palm of Heaven, buried in the ground, shifted slightly to the left, silent and unnoticed.

"Ah!" The youth's eyes widened, and he sat down, clutching his foot.

Han Li's lips curled into a smile.

At that moment, the bottle in his hand finally turned transparent, its power exhausted, shattering with a loud crash.

A temporal portal appeared behind Han Li, a surge of time energy sweeping in, enveloping his body.

In the Heavenly Realm, Nan Gongwan and Jintong stood, their eyes filled with a hint of anxiety.

Just then, a temporal portal appeared before them, and a figure emerged.

It was Han Li.

Nan Gongwan and Jintong's faces lit up with joy, and they rushed to greet him.

...

Time passed, and the ages went by, with countless years slipping away unnoticed.

In the Black Soil Heavenly Realm, the Ascension Platform was abuzz with activity, as hundreds of Ascension Arrays hummed with energy, radiating a halo of light. Each array was flanked by an Ascension Guide.

The Black Soil Heavenly Realm connected to countless lower realms, and the arrays would occasionally activate, sending up a new Ascendant, who would be guided by the Ascension Guides to a distant, sprawling complex.

Suddenly, an array on the Ascension Platform flared to life, shooting a beam of light towards the heavens. A young man with a cold, stern face emerged from the array, his body half-charred, clearly having endured a grueling Ascension.

The young man's hand, still bleeding, grasped a black sword, the two seeming to be connected.

The sword, adorned with the ancient characters "Fei Yu", was a Heavenly Artifact, its body cracked and worn, yet still radiating an astonishing aura.

An Ascension Guide, a middle-aged man with white hair, stood beside the array, his eyes wide with surprise.

He raised his hand, and a white light enveloped the young man, rapidly healing his wounds. The young man's eyes snapped open, and he gazed at the sword in his hand, a hint of pain in his eyes.

"I am Gao Sheng, welcome to the Black Soil Heavenly Realm," the Ascension Guide said with a smile.

"I am Li Feiyu, from the North Wind Realm," the young man replied, his eyes scanning the surroundings in wonder.

The Ascension Guide nodded, his expression warm.
“Lì Fēi Yǔ……” Gāo Shēng was taken aback for a moment.

“Is there something wrong with my name?” Lì Fēi Yǔ saw Gāo Shēng's expression and his eyes flashed with movement.

“There's nothing wrong, it's just that your name is very similar to that of a great expert in the True Immortal Realm, differing only by one character. That senior is called Lì Fēi Yǔ, and you are Lì Fēi Yǔ, the feather of the wing,” Gāo Shēng said with a smile.

“Oh, that's quite a coincidence,” Lì Fēi Yǔ said, his eyebrows twitching.

“Let's not talk about that. Lì Fēi Yǔ, your luck is very good. The Black Soil Immortal Domain is one of the most prosperous domains in the True Immortal Realm, and the True Immortal Realm's first sect, the True Words Sect, is located here. I, Gāo, am the True Words Sect's guide immortal, and our sect welcomes cultivators like you who have ascended from the lower realm. Are you interested in joining our sect?” Gāo Shēng suppressed his urge to divine the future and invited Lì Fēi Yǔ with a smile.

“I've just ascended to the True Immortal Realm and don't know anything about it. Joining a sect without understanding the situation doesn't seem too appropriate. Can you explain the situation in the True Immortal Realm to me?” Lì Fēi Yǔ asked, his expression unchanged.

“Of course, the True Immortal Realm is vast and boundless, divided into thousands of large and small domains. The Black Soil Immortal Domain is one of them, and each domain is enormous. Ordinary immortals can't even leave a single domain in their lifetime. As for the cultivators' realms, there's a saying that 'Golden Immortals are Tai Yi, Great Luo is the ancestor of the Dao, the Three Thousand Great Daos, and the Law is the Supreme.' Each realm requires hundreds of millions of years, or even tens of millions of years to achieve. Our sect's Hàn Tiān Zūn is a Great Luo realm expert, and he's indeed the first person in the True Immortal Realm. However, since... oh, I mentioned earlier that the expert with a similar name to yours is Hàn Tiān Zūn,” Gāo Shēng said, his expression complex, with both respect and other emotions.

“Hàn Tiān Zūn? Didn't you say that expert's name was Lì Fēi Yǔ?” Lì Fēi Yǔ asked in surprise.

“Hàn Tiān Zūn used the alias Lì Fēi Yǔ for a long time after ascending to the immortal realm, so Lì Fēi Yǔ is his second name,” Gāo Shēng explained.

“What's Hàn Tiān Zūn's full name?” Lì Fēi Yǔ asked, his curiosity piqued.

“Hàn Tiān Zūn's name is Hàn Lì,” Gāo Shēng said, bowing towards the void.

“Hàn Lì……” Lì Fēi Yǔ murmured, his expression strange.

This name, for some reason, gave him a familiar feeling.

“Silence! Hàn Tiān Zūn's reputation in the True Immortal Realm is extremely high, and his name can't be spoken directly. If someone heard it, it might cause a stir,” Gāo Shēng warned, his voice low.

“Thank you for the warning,” Lì Fēi Yǔ said, looking around cautiously, then bowing in gratitude.

“Just be careful in the future, Lì Fēi Yǔ,” Gāo Shēng said, waving his hand.

“Gāo Xiān Shǐ, since Hàn Tiān Zūn is a Great Luo realm expert, why is he the first person in the True Immortal Realm? Didn't you say that the Dao Ancestor is the highest realm?” Lì Fēi Yǔ asked again.

He had an inexplicable desire to understand Hàn Tiān Zūn.

“Hàn Tiān Zūn is the most legendary person in the True Immortal Realm's history. 'A mortal cultivates the Dao, and the winds and clouds rise again, traversing time and space, reversing the cycle of reincarnation' is all about him. His stories could be told for three days and three nights, but let's talk about it later. We should go to the Ascension Palace and register your identity,” Gāo Shēng said with a smile.

“Everything will be as you arrange, Gāo Xiān Shǐ,” Lì Fēi Yǔ said, nodding.

Thus, Gāo Shēng led Lì Fēi Yǔ towards the distant palace.

…

In a mountain valley in the Black Soil Immortal Domain, a small stream flowed, and the sun shone brightly, casting a warm glow. The trees were lush, and the air was filled with the songs of birds and the fragrance of flowers.

In the depths of the valley, there were several bamboo pavilions, and outside one of them, a group of people sat in a pavilion. One of them, dressed in a simple blue robe, looked like an ordinary mortal without any magical powers. It was Hàn Lì.

A white-robed woman sat beside him, leaning against him. It was Nán Gōng Wǎn.

A massive reversal of the cycle of reincarnation emanated from her, and she had reached the peak of the Tai Yi realm, only one step away from the Great Luo realm.

A little girl with a ponytail and a pink dress played around them, chasing after several exquisite wooden cats and dogs. The wooden animals moved as if they were alive, making sounds like "meow" and "woof," causing the little girl to laugh uncontrollably.

There were two more people in the pavilion, the Crab Daoist and Zǐ Líng, sitting across from each other, playing a game of Go. Hàn Lì and Nán Gōng Wǎn watched them play.

The Crab Daoist sat in a wheelchair, his body half-merged into the void, similar to the situation of the old master Chen Póu. However, his expression was calm and peaceful, without any signs of anxiety.

He moved his pieces quickly, and his black stones occupied a large area of the board.

Zǐ Líng wore a long, purple dress, and her cultivation had increased significantly, reaching the middle stage of the Great Luo realm.

Her white stones were not weak, holding their ground in the corners and surrounding the black stones in the center.

The atmosphere in the pavilion was peaceful, and the sunlight was warm and gentle.

At this moment, Hàn Lì's eyes moved, and a smile appeared on his face.

“Husband, what's happening?” Nán Gōng Wǎn asked, noticing the change in Hàn Lì's expression.

“Nothing, just the reincarnation of an old friend, who has ascended to the Black Soil Immortal Domain,” Hàn Lì said casually.

“Since it's the reincarnation of an old friend, should I notify Yuè Xiǎo and ask her to take care of them?” Nán Gōng Wǎn asked.

“He was a proud person in his past life, and it seems he still is. Let's not interfere with his life, and we'll meet again when fate allows it,” Hàn Lì said, shaking his head.

Nán Gōng Wǎn nodded, lost in thought.

At this moment, the clear sky suddenly darkened, and snow began to fall in the Black Soil Immortal Domain.

Hàn Lì stood still, and soon his body was covered in a layer of white snow.

He looked up, his eyes piercing through the layers of space, and the situation in the entire Black Soil Immortal Domain, as well as the surrounding domains, was clear to him.

The boundless immortal realm, with its rising and setting sun, and its white clouds and blue sky.

A moment later, Hàn Lì closed his eyes, and a gentle breeze blew, causing the snowflakes to dance in the air, like feathers.
