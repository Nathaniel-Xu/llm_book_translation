Perhaps it's because we didn't use our full strength, so our power isn't enough?" Jin Tong said, unwilling to give up.

"If we really went all out, even if we had a chance to break through the space, we'd both be injured, and it wouldn't be easy to deal with the consequences," Han Li said, shaking his head.

"This broken formation is really something, not even a single weakness can be found, it's like a tiger eating the sky, with no way to get a grip," Jin Tong said, scratching his head in frustration.

"Ah, a tiger eating the sky..." Han Li's eyes lit up as he heard this, and he clapped his hands.

Jin Tong's eyes flashed with doubt, but he quickly came to his senses: "You're saying, with my devouring law, I should devour this entire void, and pull the boundary in with it?"

"That's right. This great formation is built on this void, it's closely connected to it, so if you devour the void, the formation will definitely be affected, and it won't be hard to break through," Han Li said, nodding.

"With my devouring law at full strength, devouring the void isn't a problem, but it's best if I'm not interrupted, or else I'll be invaded by the heavenly way again and again," Jin Tong said.

"Don't worry, you just focus on devouring the void, I'll make sure you're not disturbed," Han Li said, his eyes scanning the surroundings casually.

As soon as he finished speaking, Jin Tong shot off like a bullet, heading towards the corner of the great formation.

As he flew, his body suddenly erupted with golden light, and the true form of the devouring insect appeared, its mouth open wide as it bit into the void, and a golden vortex began to spin inside its mouth.

The void in that moment seemed to collapse, like a hollowed-out cave, and Jin Tong's body sank into it.

Han Li's eyes lit up with a smile as he watched.

Outside the great formation, the group of people including Zi Shu looked grave, their faces filled with hesitation.

"This time's biggest mistake was letting that just-recovered Dao ancestor, the devouring immortal..." Meng Yuan sighed.

"What's the point of talking about it?" Zhu Yan scolded.

"Zi Shu, what do you say, should we attack or not?" Dong Li Hu asked, looking at the purple-robed woman.

As soon as he spoke, Zhu Yan and the others turned to look at her, waiting for her decision.

"If we really let them escape, we'll have to face the consequences of the supreme," Zi Shu said, taking a deep breath.

Dong Li Hu nodded, and with a wave of his hand, the light screen in front of him rippled, like waves on the surface of a pond, and he stepped forward, entering the great formation.

Meng Yuan's eyes were cast downward, looking at the void beneath his feet, as if he didn't plan on entering immediately.

"Dealing with those two, even if we four join forces, we're not guaranteed to win, I'm saying this upfront, if anyone is still hesitant and doesn't put in their full effort, even if we manage to survive, we'll have to face the consequences," Zi Shu's voice suddenly turned cold.

Zhu Yan glanced at Meng Yuan, her eyes filled with disdain, and she followed Dong Li Hu into the great formation.

Zi Shu and Meng Yuan also entered the great formation, one after the other.

Han Li, who was far away, sensed the changes in the void, and laughed coldly: "Finally willing to show up? Then let's give it a try."

As soon as he finished speaking, his sleeves puffed out, and golden light flashed inside, like a stormy sea, and the sound of thunder rumbled on.

...

In the Heavenly Palace continent.

Outside the Jade Pool, the light of the void continued to shine, and batches of immortals entered the meeting hall, guided by the heavenly palace's maids, and took their seats.

Although the atmosphere in the hall was solemn, with heavenly music playing and immortals dancing, the mood was still somewhat somber.

Aside from a few familiar immortals, who were chatting quietly, most of the people were sitting silently on their mats, either meditating or admiring the beauty of the immortals, waiting for the host to arrive.

Near the center of the hall, the seats were occupied by immortals from the heavenly palace and the major sects, who had a close relationship with the heavenly palace, and usually had disciples serving in the heavenly palace.

The two great Luo ancestors from the Tong Fa Sect and the Chang Huo Mountain were sitting separately, but communicating with each other through their minds.

"Suigu, did you have a smooth journey here?" one of the ancestors asked.

"It was okay... but I heard that many of the immortals who came to the meeting were ambushed and fell along the way, including that friend of ours, Pu Liang..." the other ancestor replied, his heart filled with fear.

"Did you see the formation outside the three heavenly gates? This time, the Wheel of Reincarnation is going to make a big move, and challenge the heavenly palace," the first ancestor said.

"The master of the Wheel of Reincarnation is indeed a formidable person, but this time, he's being a bit too reckless, choosing to attack the heavenly palace at this time, it's either going to be a brilliant move or a foolish one..." the second ancestor said, but then stopped himself, feeling that he had misspoken, and smiled awkwardly.

"The heavenly palace is probably also furious, and this time, they want to use the power of the immortals gathered here to destroy the Wheel of Reincarnation in one fell swoop, we're just pawns in their game, after all," the first ancestor said.

"We're just trying to survive, it's not easy to cultivate... let's just focus on protecting ourselves," the second ancestor said.

"Speaking of which, the battle between the supreme and the master of the Wheel of Reincarnation is a rare sight, and I'm actually looking forward to it," the first ancestor said, his eyebrows rising in a smile.

Just as he finished speaking, a commotion broke out at the back of the hall.

The two ancestors turned to look, and their eyes widened in shock.
In the center of the hall, a black and white robed Daoist was leading a tall, black-clad man with a veil covering his face, walking towards the front of the hall. The man's face was completely obscured, and his presence was shrouded in mystery.

"Who is this person, with such an arrogant attitude, that he needs to be greeted by Qingqiu True Person?" someone asked.

"I don't dare to show my true face, but judging by his attire, could it be...?"

"Could it be that person?"

"It's impossible! How dare he come, and alone at that? Does he not fear for his life?"

"Hehe, if it's really him, why should he be afraid? I've heard that Zuixuan Xuanjie has already fallen and disappeared, and it's likely that this person is responsible..."

"Wow, this is going to be a lively gathering!"

"He's been secretly competing with the Heavenly Court for years, and it's clear that he's not afraid of anyone..."

As the two men walked, the whispers and gasps of the onlookers continued, with some people standing up, their faces filled with anger or shock. Lin Lin, the Daoist, looked pale and silent, his eyes fixed on the mysterious man.

"Lu... Lu Hui, the master of the Wheel of Rebirth..." Su Valley's expression changed, and he muttered to himself.

The man in the black robe seemed to be unaware of the commotion around him, and he continued to follow Qingqiu True Person, his eyes fixed on the path ahead.

"Lu Hui, you dare to come here?" a loud voice suddenly boomed from the front of the hall.

Yu Menghan's expression changed, and she looked at the man with the veil, wondering why he was so bold.

Cangwu True Person, who was standing next to her, was also looking at the man with a serious expression.

Qingqiu True Person, who was leading the way, felt a surge of pressure, and his forehead began to sweat.

Lu Hui, the master of the Wheel of Rebirth, seemed to be unaware of the tension around him, and he continued to walk forward, his eyes fixed on the path ahead.

It turned out that Cangwu True Person had a deep grudge against Lu Hui, who had killed his only son and destroyed the entire Candle Heaven Palace. Cangwu True Person had been seeking revenge ever since, and his face was now twisted with anger.

Lu Hui glanced at Cangwu True Person, and his expression remained calm. "Who are you?" he asked.

Cangwu True Person's body began to tremble, and his face turned red with rage. "You... you dare to ask who I am?" he shouted.

Dream Mother, who was standing next to Yu Menghan, quickly intervened, trying to calm Cangwu True Person down.

But Cangwu True Person was beyond reason, and he took a step forward, his body radiating a powerful aura. The entire hall was shaken by his presence.

Qingqiu True Person quickly stepped forward, trying to mediate the situation. "Cangwu True Person, please do not cause trouble here. Lu Hui is a guest of the Zuixuan, and you must not harm him."

Cangwu True Person's eyes were blazing with anger, and he gritted his teeth. "Get out of my way..."

Just as it seemed like Cangwu True Person was about to attack Lu Hui, a powerful voice boomed from the sky, echoing throughout the hall.

The voice was like thunder, and it seemed to come from the heavens themselves. The onlookers were shocked, and they looked up at the sky in awe.

Cangwu True Person's body froze, and he slowly turned around, his eyes fixed on the figure in the sky.

Behind him, a group of figures emerged from the clouds, their presence radiating an aura of power and authority.

The figure in the center was a middle-aged man with a face like jade, his eyes and eyebrows finely chiseled. He was seated in a white wheelchair, and his body was draped in a long, white robe. A golden sash was tied around his waist, and a nine-dragon jade pendant hung from his neck.

He was the Time Daozu, Guo or Jin.

To his left stood a red-robed old woman, her hair a fiery red, her face etched with wrinkles. She was holding a staff, and her eyes seemed to burn with an inner fire.

She was the Fire Attribute Daozu, Chi Rong.

The atmosphere in the hall was electric, and the onlookers were holding their breath, waiting to see what would happen next.
