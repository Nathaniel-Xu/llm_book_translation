"I didn't tell you to take everything, leave some for them, did I?" Han Li was slightly taken aback, and he communicated with the Jingyan Firebird through his divine sense.

However, the Jingyan Firebird didn't respond, and it had been in a daze since it swallowed the Jiu Yang Fire Gallbladder. It seemed that it still hadn't woken up.

Han Li saw this and could only shake his head helplessly. He found a place to sit down.

A moment later, the others reluctantly came out of the temple, their faces filled with disappointment.

"Stone friend, are you okay?" Yang Lao asked, walking forward a few steps.

"I'm fine, just some minor injuries," Han Li replied, opening his dark and dusty palms.

"Damn it, even the well-sealed temple had nothing. What bad luck!" Fu Gu Zhu scowled, muttering to himself.

"Thanks to Stone friend, this time we didn't gain anything, but we'll definitely find something good inside. Let's go deeper," Yu Kuohai said, helping Han Li up.

"Thank you," Han Li replied gratefully.

The group rested for a moment before continuing on their way. Along the way, they encountered several more buildings, all of which Han Li opened the seals for. The others went inside to search for treasure, but they didn't find anything valuable. However, they did manage to find some minor treasures.

Time passed quickly, and several days went by.

Han Li and his group finally emerged from the mountains and arrived at the entrance of a gray canyon.

Inside the canyon, mist swirled, and in the distance, a massive gray tower stood, its peak piercing the clouds.

"This tower looks extraordinary! Let's go take a look!" Yu Kuohai exclaimed, his face filled with excitement. He quickly led the group forward, and soon they arrived at the tower.

The gray tower was ancient and majestic, with a diameter of dozens of miles. Its height surpassed the surrounding mountains, and its peak seemed to touch the clouds.

The tower's surface was covered in gray lightning patterns, and from time to time, gray-black lightning bolts shot out, dancing around the tower like snakes. The air around the tower seemed to tremble, as if it might be torn apart at any moment.

At the top of the tower, a massive golden flame burned, its light shining brightly like the sun.

However, despite its brilliance, the flame seemed to exist in a different space, and it was impossible to reach.

As the group approached the tower, Yu Kuohai's excitement turned to disappointment.

The ground in front of the tower was crowded with people.

"Hmph, it seems everyone's here!" Yu Kuohai grumbled.

Han Li ignored the crowd and looked up at the golden flame on the tower's peak.

Within the flame, he could sense the fluctuations of the time law, which seemed to be restrained by some unknown force.

Although it was only a faint echo, Han Li could feel the profound power of the time law, and his eyes sparkled with excitement.

"Let's go down! Stone friend, remember to be careful and watch your words," Yu Kuohai said, turning to Han Li.

Han Li nodded hastily.

The group gathered in front of the gray tower, and the leaders of the various factions, including Lei Yuze, Su Ci, and others, stood at the entrance of a massive stone door at the base of the tower. The door was adorned with the words "Sui Yue Tower" in large characters.

The door was gray-black in color, with intricate lightning patterns and a gray lightning screen that emitted a frightening hissing sound.

Lei Yuze, Su Ci, and the others seemed to be discussing something.

Han Li had gathered information about the various factions along the way, and he had a good understanding of their leaders.

He glanced at the group before looking away.

The people from Ling Xiao Men, Qing Su Valley, and Lie Guang City arrived, but they didn't attract much attention from the crowd. Most people glanced at them before turning back to the tower, excitedly discussing the possibilities.

At this moment, in a corner of the crowd, the blue-robed siblings, Lan Yuanzi and Lan Cai, stood together.

"I didn't expect to find such a massive tower in the depths of the secret realm. The treasure left behind by the Tai Sui Immortal is probably here," Lan Yuanzi said, his eyes shining with excitement.

The siblings had come to the Jin Yuan Xian Domain to capture Han Li, but they didn't want to miss this opportunity.

"This tower's lightning power is incredibly strong. Do you recognize what kind of lightning this is?" Lan Cai asked, looking at the tower with curiosity.

"It's probably some kind of yin lightning. I don't know much about lightning, though..." Lan Yuanzi replied, his expression changing suddenly.

"Wait, what's that?" Lan Yuanzi's eyes widened as he stared at Han Li, who was standing not far away.
Han Li's palm flashed with a blue light, and a blue circular mirror appeared, with layers of blue light rippling on its surface like water waves.

"Brother..." said a voice beside him, with a brightening of the eyes.

"It's Han Li!" Lan Yuanzi's face lit up with joy, and he immediately began to manipulate the mirror with his fingers.

At the same time, as soon as Han Li landed, the time laws within his body suddenly fluctuated, as if something had triggered them.

"Someone is using a sensing divine artifact to sense me!" he thought to himself, immediately understanding what was happening.

He quickly activated the "Wan Qiao Kong Ji Technique", closing all of his divine orifices, and simultaneously activated the "Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue", intertwining the five time laws to form a seal-like existence that hid in the depths of his body.

Han Li's divine spirit energy also withdrew, not emitting a single thread of energy.

The "Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue" was the most superior time cultivation technique, not only powerful, but also extremely skilled in concealing one's aura.

Han Li's current cultivation had reached the peak of the Tai Yi stage, and the various uses of the "Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue" were gradually unfolding.

On the other side, Lan Yuanzi was frantically manipulating the blue mirror, but the ripples on its surface suddenly disappeared, returning to its original state.

Lan Yuanzi was shocked, but eventually accepted reality, stopping his actions.

"What's wrong? Did we sense incorrectly?" Lan Yan asked, her eyebrows furrowed.

"The sensing mirror suddenly lost the sense of Han Li's aura, it seems he detected someone sensing him and hid his aura. This person is quite cautious," Lan Yuanzi said, his face looking unpleasant.

"How could this be? The sensing mirror is a precious treasure given by our master, even a Da Luo existence might not be able to evade its sensing," Lan Yan said, surprised.

"It seems Han Li is not simple, but this time, we didn't gain nothing, at least we can confirm that Han Li is in the vicinity," Lan Yuanzi said, his eyes narrowing as he looked at the surrounding crowd.

"That's right! And the group of people who just arrived are suspicious, as soon as they got here, the sensing mirror reacted, Han Li might be hiding among them," Lan Yan said, looking at the disciples of the Ling Xiao Gate and the other two great sects.

"Very likely, but we can't completely ignore the others," Lan Yuanzi said, nodding thoughtfully.

Lan Yan nodded, about to continue investigating.

"Don't act rashly, we currently can't confirm Han Li's identity, and he probably hasn't discovered us yet. Now, we need to compete with him in endurance and observation, to see who finds the other first, I don't believe he can keep his aura hidden forever," Lan Yuanzi immediately stopped Lan Yan's actions, smiling coldly and revealing his white teeth.

"With brother you taking action, Han Li will soon be caught, and now he's even sent himself to our doorstep, how convenient!" Lan Yan said, her face filled with admiration.

...

"Who could be sensing me... Qi Mozi? It doesn't feel like him, if Qi Mozi had such a sensing technique, he would have used it earlier. Or maybe it's someone else, like the Lan siblings from the Jiu Yuan Guan?" Han Li thought to himself, his mind racing as he looked at the surrounding crowd.

"It's him!" his eyes suddenly stopped on a young man, but quickly moved away, not wanting to draw attention.

That person was Xiong Shan, currently standing at the edge of the crowd with a group of loose cultivators.

Han Li had only met him briefly at the Jin Yuan Xian Gong, but his impression was deep, and he wouldn't mistake him.

"This person's appearance is unfamiliar, but gives me a familiar feeling, who is he? And since he's here, Qi Mozi must also be here, maybe the person from earlier was really Qi Mozi..." Han Li thought, his mind racing with possibilities.

He didn't dare to act rashly, knowing that he couldn't guarantee his safety against Qi Mozi, a Da Luo of time.

Moreover, if the Lan siblings from the Jiu Yuan Guan were also here, it would be a troublesome matter.

Just as Han Li was thinking, Yu Kuo Hai and the others arrived at the giant stone door, having arranged their teams.

" Alliance leader!" Yu Kuo Hai said.

"Ah, Yu Dao friend, Yang Chang Lao, Fu Gu Zhu, how were your gains?" Lei Yu Ce asked, looking at the three.

"Don't mention it, almost everything has been taken by others! How infuriating!" Yu Kuo Hai said, annoyed.

"Yu Dao friend, don't worry, the age-restricting formation of the tower is still intact, and the treasures inside should still be there. However, the thousand-zi-yin thunder formation on the door is difficult to break, we're discussing countermeasures. The three of you are experienced, since you've arrived, let's discuss it together," Lei Yu Ce said, his tone neutral.

Yu Kuo Hai and the others looked at each other.

"If we're talking about breaking formations, with Lei Dao friend here, what can we say? Lei Dao friend has already recognized the formation on the door, you must have a plan to break it," Fu Gu Zhu said, flattering.

"I wouldn't say that, but I do have a plan to break it, however, I need everyone's help," Lei Yu Ce said, smiling.

"No problem, Lei Dao friend, just give the orders," Yu Kuo Hai and the others said, thumping their chests.

"Very well, I'll explain the plan...," Lei Yu Ce said, his eyes flashing with satisfaction.

The group discussed for half an hour, then dispersed, each person gathering their teams, and eventually gathering nearly a hundred people to draw formation patterns on the ground, setting up formation tools, and so on.
