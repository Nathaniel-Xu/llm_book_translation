“Haha, don’t struggle anymore, it’s better to let me go and try my luck, at least... your two little followers will have a chance to survive.” The evil corpse persuaded again.

Han Li’s mind was wavering, hesitant and indecisive, but time was running out.

As he looked at his body, which was already at its limit, he gritted his teeth and made a bold move, and the thought of releasing the seal on the evil corpse’s body made the chains that bound him “clang” and break open.

“Haha, this is more like it...” The evil corpse laughed wildly.

But his laughter was cut short, as Han Li had not completely released his seal, but only removed half of the chains.

“Borrowing power doesn’t mean you have to use it all.” Han Li sneered.

“You...” The evil corpse suddenly became enraged.

As half of the chains were removed, Han Li’s body, which was on the verge of collapse, suddenly regained control, and a surge of energy burst forth from his body.

He turned his hands, and the lightning gold light in his hands recondensed, emitting a terrifying aura.

Yue Qing saw this sudden turn of events and was shocked, unable to understand how Han Li had done it, and could only quickly pinch a spell to retract his spiritual domain back into his body, and a thick, boundless aura erupted from his body.

He raised his giant sword, and with one hand, he drew a spell on the sword, infusing it with a dense, earth-attribute law energy, and the seven mountain symbols reappeared on the sword.

Yue Qing let out a loud shout, and with a swift motion, he swung his sword at Han Li.

In the void, a massive sword light split the sky, and seven majestic mountain peaks appeared, each with a giant symbol etched into it, surrounded by a yellow cloud, exuding a powerful, suppressing aura.

But just as Yue Qing was about to strike, Han Li’s hands suddenly changed, and he grasped a bow instead of a sword, and a golden bow made of lightning appeared in his hands, with a golden arrow nocked and ready to fire.

A loud, piercing sound echoed through the air.

In an instant, the golden arrow pierced the first mountain peak.

Then, the second, third... the golden arrow seemed to pass through the mountains as if they were nothing, and it came to Yue Qing’s front.

Yue Qing, as a late-stage Da Luo cultivator, was caught off guard, but his reaction was swift.

He raised his giant sword to block the arrow, and then dodged to the side, avoiding the vital spot.

“Boom, boom, boom...”

The arrow’s momentum was too great, and as it pierced the sword, the sound of the mountain peaks exploding echoed through the air, and the sound of the arrow piercing Yue Qing’s left chest was drowned out.

Yue Qing was blown back thousands of feet, and his body crashed into the ground like a meteorite.

The ground shook, and a massive crater was formed, with Yue Qing’s body at the center.

Han Li’s situation was not much better, his body was charred, his seven orifices were bleeding, and his eyes had turned a darker shade of black, and he stumbled and fell from the sky.

The thirty-six bamboo swords flew towards him, using their last bit of energy to catch him and bring him to the ground.

Wu Nai and Po Feng saw this and their faces changed, clearly not expecting Yue Qing, a late-stage Da Luo cultivator, to be defeated by Han Li, who was two realms lower.

Their morale was severely dampened.

Jin Tong and Xiao Bai saw this and quickly took advantage of the situation, pushing Wu Nai and Po Feng back, and rushed towards Han Li.

The two of them did not continue to fight, and instead, they immediately chased after Yue Qing.

“Uncle...” Jin Tong helped Han Li up, and said with a furrowed brow.

Han Li was weak, and his spiritual sea was turbulent, but he managed to take out a pill and tried to swallow it, but it was too difficult.

Xiao Bai saw this and quickly took the pill from Han Li and fed it to him.

“Let’s go, quickly, let’s leave this place.” Han Li said, after swallowing the pill.

Jin Tong did not say anything, and immediately put Han Li on his shoulder, and was about to leave.

“Where are you going?” A voice filled with anger echoed from the distance.

Han Li looked in the direction of the voice, and saw a tall figure slowly flying towards him.

The figure was holding a giant sword, and the sword had a fist-sized hole in it, and it looked like it had lost its spiritual energy.

The figure’s body was covered in scales, and its chest was exposed, with a massive spiral wound, and golden blood was flowing from it, and the surrounding area was charred and blackened.

“Late-stage Da Luo cultivators are indeed formidable.” Han Li said, looking at Yue Qing, who was approaching them.

“Puny early-stage Da Luo cultivator, you are the first and only one to heavily injure me, I will not let you go until I have crushed you to dust.” Yue Qing said, his teeth clenched in anger.

Jin Tong saw this and his face turned serious, and he put Han Li down, and stood in front of him and Xiao Bai.

“Big brother...” Xiao Bai said, looking at Jin Tong’s back.

“Are late-stage Da Luo cultivators really that powerful?”
Just as they were about to leave, a cold and detached voice suddenly echoed through the air, as if it came from the heavens and reverberated throughout the entire Ti Hu Mountain.

"Who is it?" Yue Qing stopped in her tracks, looking up at the sky with a hint of caution.

The next instant, the clear blue sky suddenly darkened, as if night had fallen in an instant.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he looked up, and he saw a gigantic figure descending from the depths of the sky. The figure grew smaller and smaller, until it finally transformed into a tall, burly man clad in a cloak.

His face was angular, with a thick grey beard and sunken eyes that seemed to hold a deep sense of weariness. But despite his rugged appearance, he was none other than Yue Mian, one of the Eight True Spirit Kings.

"Uncle Yue, why have you come?" Xiao Bai exclaimed in surprise.

Jin Tong, on the other hand, looked at Yue Mian with a mixture of awe and reverence.

"Hmph, if I hadn't come, you would have been killed by Han Li here," Yue Mian said with a hint of displeasure, glancing at Han Li.

Jin Tong's expression changed, and he looked at Yue Mian with a hint of anger.

"It's not Han Li's fault, Uncle Yue," Xiao Bai quickly explained. "I was the one who insisted on coming."

"This can be discussed later," Yue Mian said with a wave of his hand, turning to face Yue Qing and the others.

"I didn't expect to see you again, Yue Mian," Yue Qing said, her eyes filled with surprise. "It seems that this young man's identity is indeed extraordinary..."

Yue Mian's response was brief and to the point. "Leave now, before I take action."

Yue Qing, who was already heavily injured, knew better than to provoke a True Spirit King. She left behind a parting remark, "Don't forget the lessons of the past, Yue Mian," before flying away with Wu and Jin.

"Thank you, Uncle Yue," Han Li said, bowing his head in gratitude.

Yue Mian nodded, his expression softening. "Rest for a while longer. With me here, no one will dare to disturb you."

Han Li nodded, sitting back down to meditate. He had suffered greatly in the previous battle, and the seal on his body had been partially broken. He knew that he had to be careful, as the time for him to make his move was drawing near.

"I arrived early to escort you, but I didn't expect to sense that you had used the golden talisman given to you by Bai Ze," Yue Mian said, looking at Xiao Bai. "I had to hurry to catch up with you."

"Uncle Yue, you were worried that I wouldn't return on time, weren't you?" Xiao Bai asked.

Yue Mian didn't respond, but his expression spoke volumes.

"Don't worry, Uncle Yue. This time, I've seen the difference between my cultivation and others. I'll return and focus on my training, and I won't come out again until I've fully inherited my father's power," Xiao Bai said, his eyes shining with determination.

Yue Mian nodded, a hint of a smile on his face. "You've made some progress, indeed."

Jin Tong, who had been watching from the side, couldn't help but smile as well.

After about an hour, Han Li finally finished his meditation and opened his eyes.

Yue Mian bid him farewell, preparing to leave with Xiao Bai.

"Uncle Yue, wait," Han Li said suddenly.

"What is it?" Yue Mian asked, turning to face him.

"Since you're returning to Ba Huang Mountain, may I ask if I can come with you?" Han Li asked, bowing his head.

Yue Mian's expression changed, and he looked at Han Li with surprise. "You want to go to Ba Huang Mountain as well?"

Han Li nodded. "Yes, if it's not too much trouble."

Yue Mian's eyes narrowed, but he nodded. "Very well. Let's go."

With a wave of his hand, a burst of blue wind erupted, and Han Li's body was lifted off the ground. He felt a strange sensation, as if he was being pulled through space and time.

Before he could react, he found himself sitting on the back of a gigantic blue bird. The bird's body was enormous, blocking out the sky and casting a shadow over the land.

Han Li's eyes widened as he looked around, taking in the breathtaking sight.

Yue Mian had transformed into his true form, the majestic You Tian Kun Peng.

Compared to the bird, Han Li felt like a tiny, insignificant speck.

Xiao Bai sat beside him, his face filled with a mix of shock, excitement, and awe.

"I... I never knew that Uncle Yue was so powerful," Xiao Bai stammered.

Han Li couldn't help but feel a sense of reverence as he looked at Yue Mian. He had never seen anything like this before.

The blue bird spread its wings, and Han Li felt a rush of wind as they took to the skies.
