"Regarding this Taishan Immortal Mansion, I know only this much, and you already know the purpose of my and Huo San's visit. As for the alliance proposed by Shi Mou, how do you think, Fellow Han?" Shi Qing Hou waited for a moment, seeing Han Li remained silent, before asking.

"Alright, I, Han, can agree to form an alliance with you two, and even assist you in obtaining that life-bound talisman later. However, if I encounter any difficulties in the future and need assistance, I hope you two won't refuse to help." Han Li's thoughts turned, and he slowly spoke.

"Deal!" Huo San and Shi Qing Hou heard this and immediately exclaimed with joy.

Jiao San's eyes sparkled with a hint of thought, but she didn't speak.

"Since that's settled, let's set off now." Shi Qing Hou said, glancing at the blue-robed middle-aged man beside him.

"Follow me, don't look around, and don't touch anything. If you have any questions, don't ask me."

The blue-robed middle-aged man said indifferently, then urged the auspicious horse forward, with Lan Yan and the others following closely behind, like zombies.

Han Li and the others also followed.

As a result, they walked for an entire day and night.

The middle-aged man led Han Li away from the gourd-shaped mountain, soon leaving the Gobi Desert behind, and then passing through a vast swamp, followed by a range of undulating hills...

Along the way, Han Li discovered strange and wondrous things, such as a hundred-zhang-tall ice sculpture standing upright on the Gobi Desert, giving off a chill that could be felt from afar, a massive whirlpool in the swamp that constantly churned out water bubbles, and the sound of muffled pounding coming from beneath the hills, as if someone was constantly striking something. Even when they passed through a forest of giant trees, they found a series of blood-red chains linking nearly a thousand trees together, forming a strange shape.

Due to the middle-aged man's previous warning, and his apparent reluctance to speak, everyone remained silent, lost in their own thoughts, as they hurried along. Han Li didn't find an opportunity to investigate, and could only give up.

After a series of twists and turns, the group finally arrived at a black grand hall situated on a grassy plain.

This grand hall was larger, but the light was very dim, so several fire basins were lit to illuminate the interior.

Inside, a dark red gate stood tall, emitting a faint dark red glow.

"This is the entrance to the sixth layer, you can go now." The blue-robed middle-aged man said, turning to leave.

"Senior, the sixth and seventh layers are unknown dangers, and although we are strong, it's not easy to break through. Can you please release these companions of mine, and let them come with us? It would be easier for us." Huo San suddenly called out to the blue-robed middle-aged man, then looked at Lan Yan and the others.

"These people are not weak, and have some use. You don't lack these few phantom slaves." Shi Qing Hou added.

"Very well." The blue-robed middle-aged man's brow furrowed, then relaxed, and he made a hand seal.

Seven gray-white lights shot out from his hand, entering Lan Yan and the others.

Lan Yan and the others immediately radiated a large amount of gray-white light, and then a series of gray-white crystal threads flew out of their bodies, merging into the blue-robed middle-aged man's body.

Han Li watched the gray-white crystal threads, his pupils constricting.

"Kid, when you go to the seventh layer, if you encounter my life-bound talisman, remember to bring it with you. I'll have a reward for you." Just then, a faint voice suddenly appeared in Han Li's mind, belonging to the auspicious horse.

He felt a stir in his heart, and looked at the auspicious horse.

The horse obediently carried the blue-robed middle-aged man, its eyes fixed straight ahead.

"Let's go." The blue-robed middle-aged man finished, and indifferently said.

The auspicious horse moved its four legs, and a white light flashed, causing the two to vanish into thin air, leaving no residual aura behind, as if they had never appeared.

The crystal threads left their bodies, and the gray-white light in Lan Yan and the others' eyes quickly dissipated.

Han Li saw this, and made a hand seal, his body flashing with red light as he transformed back into his original appearance.

Huo San and Jiao San also saw this, and made a hand seal, restoring their original appearances. Huo San also put away the Tianhu Xue knife.

The three of them had just finished when Lan Yan, Lei Yu Ce, and the others' eyes cleared, and they looked around in confusion.

"Where are we? I remember being invaded by the gray-white crystal threads of the precious treasure..." Lei Yu Ce, Su Qianqian, and the others exclaimed.

Han Li saw this, and thought that people controlled by the gray-white crystal threads wouldn't retain any memories.

Lan Yan and the others were also confused, only remembering their memories before being controlled by the blue-robed middle-aged man.

"Don't worry, everyone, the enemy has left, and we're safe now." Huo San slowly said.

"Do you know what happened?" Lei Yu Ce asked.

"I know a bit, Fellow Lei, it's like this..." Huo San coughed, and fabricated a story, saying that Han Li had displayed great power, defeating the enemy and saving everyone.

Huo San was skilled in speaking, and his fabrication was flawless, covering all aspects without leaving any loopholes.

Han Li heard this, and couldn't help but feel a bitter smile, but didn't say anything.

"If that's the case, then Shi Fellow has saved us again. We're grateful, and when we exit the Taishan Immortal Mansion, Shi Fellow must come to our Tian Shui Sect as a guest. We'll treat you to a feast, and express our gratitude." Su Qianqian said gratefully.

Xiong Shan, Lan Yan, and Lan Yuanzi also thanked Han Li, but the Lan siblings' gazes held a hint of wariness and caution.
Here is the translation of the chapter:

Apart from that, Lei Yu Ce, Jin Liu, and Wen Zhong's expressions were somewhat downcast.

They had previously spent a lot of effort trying to break the seal, but in the end, they didn't get anything. Especially Jin Liu, whose insect nest was taken away by Han Li. Now, he was rescued by Han Li in a confused state, and his heart couldn't help but feel depressed.

"No need to be polite, those enemies may return at any time, and this place is not suitable for a long stay. We should leave quickly and enter the sixth layer," Han Li said, waving his hand.

"Not bad, time is of the essence," Su Zhen Zi nodded and said.

Lei Yu Ce and the others also forced themselves to cheer up and began to break the seal on the space door.

The seals on each space door were basically the same, and the group had already become familiar with them. They quickly broke the seal on the light door in front of them and entered one after another.

Han Li only felt a flash of light in front of him, and his figure passed through the light door, arriving at a vast expanse of golden sand.

He looked far into the distance, gazing at the surroundings, but all he saw was endless yellow sand, and the air was filled with a dry, desolate smell.

At this time, light flashed beside him, and the figures of Jiao San and the others appeared one after another.

These people didn't say a word, and naturally divided into two groups.

Among them, Huo San and Jiao San were naturally closer to Han Li, while the two from Tian Shui Sect were closer to Lei Yu Ce and Wen Zhong. The Lan Yuanzi siblings followed behind them.

What was strange was that Xiong Shan was standing on Han Li's side for some reason.

After everyone stood still, they looked around at the surroundings.

After a moment, their eyes flickered, and their faces revealed a hint of a strange color.

Jiao San bent down and picked up a handful of fine sand, gently rubbing it, and her brow furrowed slightly as she said, "This is gold sand..."

"It's not gold sand, it's a large amount of bone powder from demonic beasts," Han Li shook his head and said.

"How is that possible?" Jiao San asked in disbelief.

"It's indeed bone powder," Lei Yu Ce suddenly spoke up.

He pointed to a curved, crescent-shaped object in the distance, which was protruding from the horizon.

Everyone followed his gaze and flew over to take a closer look, only to discover that it was a curved horn from a massive, ancient beast's remains. Its body was a golden yellow color, and it was covered in wind-swept, corroded marks.

Jiao San's brow furrowed, and she wanted to reach out and touch the horn.

But as soon as she made contact with it, she heard a faint "poof" sound.

The golden, curved horn suddenly shattered, turning into a cloud of golden sand that dispersed, revealing that the sand below was indeed bone powder.

"This vast desert, which direction should we head in?" Huo San asked helplessly.

He looked up at the sky, and his gaze finally settled on the white, circular sun hanging above, which seemed to be drawn on a piece of white paper, without any heat emanating from it.

Lei Yu Ce was about to speak when Han Li suddenly pointed in a direction and said, "That way..."

Everyone followed his gaze, but all they saw was the endless sand sea, with nothing in sight.

After entering the sixth layer, everyone's spiritual sense was suppressed even more, and they could only sense things within a hundred miles.

"What's there?" Su Zhen Zi asked curiously.

"I'm not sure, my spiritual sense is being suppressed too much. I can only faintly sense a special aura... Let's just go take a look," Han Li said after a moment of contemplation.

Jiao San and Huo San exchanged a glance, and both looked hesitant.

"Stone friend, it's not easy to get here, and many people have died along the way. I think it's better not to act rashly. Let's discuss it and find a safer route," Lei Yu Ce said after a moment of hesitation.

"Yes, this tower is more treacherous the higher you go. Even if you're skilled and brave, you can't be too careful," Jin Liu chimed in.

Su Zhen Zi opened her mouth as if to say something, but hesitated and ultimately remained silent.

"Thank you for your concern, but everyone can go wherever they want. Since we're already at the sixth layer, each person has their own considerations. I'll just go on my own," Han Li said with a slight bow, smiling.

He then wanted to leave first.

"Stone friend, I'll go with you," Xiong Shan said with a smile.

Han Li heard this, but his expression didn't change, and he didn't respond. He simply flew off in the direction he had pointed, with Xiong Shan following closely behind.

"We'll also follow Stone friend," Jiao San said after a moment of consideration, and she and Huo San flew off in pursuit of Han Li and Xiong Shan.
