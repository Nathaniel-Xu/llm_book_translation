Han Li couldn't hear the whispers exchanged between Yu Kuohai and the others, but with his years of experience in navigating the complexities of human relationships, he could roughly guess the content of their conversation.

He thought to himself for a moment, his face expressionless, as he glanced around, seemingly pondering something.

This scene naturally caught the attention of Yang Zong and Yu Kuohai, who exchanged a knowing glance, their eyes returning to Han Li.

"Friends, could you point me in the right direction, so I can leave? I have urgent matters to attend to," Han Li said with a deliberate tone.

Yu Kuohai's face was filled with a rich smile as he replied, "Ah, Brother Shi, why the haste? Let me tell you, your luck has arrived. You've stumbled into a sacred realm, where opportunities and treasures abound. As long as you follow us, you'll surely gain something."

Han Li's voice rose in excitement, "What, a sacred realm? You mean this place? I said it looked unusual."

Yu Kuohai continued, "Yes, this is the sacred realm of the Tai Sui Immortal, a true immortal of the Great Luo Realm. Brother Shi, you've stumbled into this place by chance, and who knows, it might be a great opportunity destined for you. Don't miss it!"

Fu Guzhu also chimed in, "That's right! We come from all over, and we're all fellow practitioners of renowned sects. Since we've met, why not explore this sacred realm together? We might find a great opportunity!"

Han Li listened to their words, his heart coldly amused. If he hadn't already seen through their intentions, he feared that other unsuspecting cultivators might be swayed by their flattery.

The others around him seemed to be standing randomly, but they had subtly formed a circle around Han Li, their faces mostly smiling, but it was clear they wouldn't let him slip away easily.

Han Li pretended to be hesitant, rubbing his chin, and muttered, "This..."

Yu Kuohai saw this and thought he had Han Li in the bag, so he made a gesture to Yang Zong.

Yang Zong understood and spoke up, "Brother Shi, since you're stuck here anyway, why not join us? We're stronger together, and it's safer that way."

Han Li seemed to be wavering, and Fu Guzhu's face turned serious, "Brother Shi, don't you look down on the Ling Xiao Sect, Lie Guang City, and our Qing Su Valley?"

Han Li quickly bowed his head, "I wouldn't dare. Thank you for your kindness. I'll follow you, and I won't seek any great rewards, just the chance to serve you."

Fu Guzhu was surprised by Han Li's words, and he whispered to the others, "This guy's not bad, if he can take care of himself later, we can spare his life."

Yu Kuohai laughed, "Don't worry, Brother Shi, as long as you help us, we won't let you lose out."

Han Li nodded enthusiastically, his face filled with a mixture of fear and gratitude.

After some small talk, the group set off again, heading deeper into the sacred realm.

Yang Zong suddenly asked, "Brother Shi, didn't you find anything on your way here?"

Han Li looked embarrassed, "I didn't know I was in a sacred realm until you told me. I wasn't looking for treasures, and soon I encountered that metal beast. I was chased and didn't even remember how I got here."

Yu Kuohai waved his hand, "It's okay, now that we're together, we'll take care of each other."

Han Li bowed his head, "Thank you, everyone."

Yu Kuohai and the others exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with a hint of disdain, thinking that Han Li was a timid and foolish middle-aged man who would be easy to manipulate.

As they continued on their journey, they introduced themselves, and Han Li learned that they were all from different sects.

The group followed a winding mountain path, and Han Li remained silent, listening to their conversation. He discovered that eight out of ten sentences were curses directed at those who had previously stolen treasures.

The remaining two sentences were also not kind, but they were directed at the Tian Shui Sect and the Tong Tian Sword Sect.

Han Li waited for an opportunity to ask, "Brother Yu, are there people from the Tian Shui Sect and the Tong Tian Sword Sect in this sacred realm?"

Yu Kuohai didn't want to answer, but seeing Han Li's fearful expression, he replied, "Don't worry, Brother Shi, this sacred realm is vast, and they can't monopolize it. We'll have our own opportunities."

Fu Guzhu added, "If we encounter any problems, we can always join forces with the Huang Feng Sect and the Mo Xiang Lou. United, we'll be a force to be reckoned with, and those two sects will have to be cautious."

Han Li nodded quickly, relieved, "That's good, that's good..."

Fu Guzhu saw Han Li's reaction and couldn't help but smile mockingly, but he quickly suppressed it.

He didn't know that Han Li wasn't concerned about the Tian Shui Sect and the Tong Tian Sword Sect, but rather about the Qi Mozi and the Xian Gong.

Han Li asked again, "Are there any other sects or forces that I should be aware of?"

Fu Guzhu was slightly annoyed, "Brother Shi, why are you so concerned about this? What's the point of knowing?"
Fu Dao You, I'm not afraid of not recognizing the true person, but what if I accidentally provoke someone I shouldn't, wouldn't that be causing trouble for all of you?" Han Li said with a hint of displeasure.

"Stone Dao You is right to consider this, it's worth paying attention to. However, aside from the Tian Shui Sect and the Tong Tian Sword Sect, others will leave us alone as long as they don't provoke us." Yang Lao pointed his head in agreement.

Han Li listened to this and sighed inwardly, thinking that this was just empty words.

However, from their conversation, it could be seen that whether Qi Mo Zi and the Xian Gong people came or not, at least they didn't show up in their true form. If they had, with their Da Luo realm cultivation, these people wouldn't be so calm and composed.

The specific situation could only be observed by following them.

Han Li didn't ask any more questions, and the rest of the people seemed to be preoccupied with their own thoughts, so the group fell silent.

The crowd walked quietly in the forest for several hours, until finally, a magnificent crimson-colored grand hall appeared in front of them.

Upon seeing the grand hall, Yu Kuo Hai and the others didn't show any excitement, instead, they looked worried, fearing that it was another useless grand hall that had been plundered.

The crowd arrived at the grand hall, and Yu Kuo Hai went forward to examine it for a moment before letting out a sigh of relief, saying:

"Fortunately, the seal is still intact..."

"Stone Dao You, you're skilled at breaking seals, why don't you take a look at this seal?" Yang Lao said with a smile, glancing at Han Li.

"Alright, I'll give it a try!"

Han Li knew that this was another test, so he pretended to be confident and made a show of his abilities.

He walked to the entrance of the grand hall, looked it up and down, and saw that the door was adorned with a circular iron plate engraved with two beasts biting each other's tails, surrounded by eight lightning symbols.

Han Li recognized the eight symbols, which represented the legendary Eight Lightning Gods, and the two beasts in the center were the Yin and Yang Lightning Beasts.

However, he didn't immediately speak up, instead, he stood to the side, scratching his ear and deep in thought, looking puzzled.

Yu Kuo Hai looked at him impatiently and asked: "Stone Dao You, do you recognize this seal or not? If you can't break it, I'll use force to break it open."

"Yu Dao You, this... the two beasts on the iron plate I recognize, but the surrounding symbols are only half-understood. I only know that this seal is related to lightning, and if we force it open, we might trigger the seal and cause the entire grand hall to be destroyed by lightning, and we won't get anything." Han Li said with a hesitant expression.

"Oh, is that so?" Yu Kuo Hai asked, sounding uncertain.

"Yu Dao You, if you don't believe me, you can try using a little force to test it, and you'll see if it's really related to lightning." Han Li said with a wry smile.

Yu Kuo Hai's expression changed, and he suddenly smiled, saying:

"Stone Dao You's words, I naturally believe. But how do you plan to break this seal, do you have a good method?"

"We need to try it out first, I wonder which Dao You can help me with?" Han Li looked at the crowd, saying.

The crowd looked at each other, and then turned their gaze to Han Li.

"Everyone..." Han Li said with a bitter smile.

"Stone Dao You, since you're the one who breaks seals, it's only natural that you try it yourself." Yang Lao said with a chuckle.

The rest of the people nodded in agreement.

"Since that's the case, then please, everyone, take a step back. After all, this is a Xian family's seal, and its power is hard to say..." Han Li said with a helpless expression.

The crowd retreated over a hundred feet, and Han Li turned his back to them, a smile appearing on his face as he began to break the seal.

For Han Li, breaking the seal wasn't difficult, and after a few dozen breaths, he used the Xie Ye Shen Lei in his body to connect with the seal and break it open.

However, he didn't make a sound, instead, he used his heart to contact the Jing Yan Huo Niao, and quietly released it from the gap in the door.

After a few dozen breaths, Han Li's hands suddenly flashed with silver lightning, and a loud "boom" sound was heard as he flew backward.

The crowd was shocked, and no one noticed a flash of silver fire that flew out from the lightning and disappeared into Han Li's sleeve.

Han Li flew out over a hundred feet before landing heavily on the ground, his clothes torn and tattered, looking like he had suffered a great loss.

Yang Lao and the others glanced at him, saw that the grand hall's entrance was open, and rushed inside.

However, after a short while, the sound of shouting and cursing came from inside the grand hall.
