It seems that my intuition was correct, this place is indeed worth my personal visit. Yu Qing looked Han Li up and down, his gaze sweeping over Jin Tong and Xiao Bai, and he felt an increasing sense of excitement.

Others may be able to see through Jin Tong's identity, but they cannot recognize Xiao Bai's true form. However, Yu Qing quickly discovered the anomaly.

Perhaps, Xiao Bai is the big fish in his eyes.

The silver circular mirror released a white radiance, containing a powerful spatial law that suppressed Han Li and the others. They felt an overwhelming pressure, as if a mountain was crushing them, and they were unable to move.

"That person's cultivation realm is far beyond my expectations, we cannot match him. I will think of a way to break the seal, Jin Tong, you take Xiao Bai and escape separately. That Da Luo later-stage cultivator will definitely chase me, if you have the opportunity to escape, return to the Barbarian Realm and wait for me at the Eight Desolations Mountain." Han Li swept his gaze around, transmitting his voice to Jin Tong and Xiao Bai.

"Uncle, I want to stay with you, we can't defeat these people." Jin Tong quickly replied.

"Big brother, I also want to go with you." Xiao Bai also exclaimed.

"When White Ze previously agreed to let you follow me, one of the conditions was that I had to guarantee your safety. If you were to get into trouble, wouldn't I be breaking my promise to him?" Han Li's tone became heavier, transmitting his voice.

"But..."

Xiao Bai wanted to speak, but Han Li continued, "You don't have to worry, as long as you escape, I will definitely find a way to escape."

As soon as he finished speaking, Han Li closed his eyes, and the "Great Five Elements Fantasy Technique" began to operate silently within him.

However, just as his body was about to stir up a wave of spiritual energy, Yu Qing, the newly appointed Palace Master of the Golden Source Heavenly Palace, sneered and said:

"Haha, you're really not seeing the coffin without shedding tears."

The next instant, the silver circular mirror's light flickered, and a loud "rumble" of thunder sounded.

The ring-shaped symbol on the mirror's surface suddenly changed, and a lightning symbol appeared, followed by several thick, purple lightning bolts that shot out from the mirror, striking Han Li and the others.

"Crackle"

The purple lightning bolts surrounded Han Li and the others, filling the entire area with countless tiny electrical sparks. Han Li and the others were unable to avoid it.

At this moment, Jin Tong suddenly flew up, his arms waving, and two thin, crystal-like wings appeared behind him, shining with a transparent light. The wings were formed by his own law, and they hovered above the three of them.

Most of the lightning bolts were blocked by the wings, causing a dazzling display of golden-purple light. The remaining lightning bolts that passed through were no longer a threat.

No one noticed that Han Li's figure had disappeared in an instant.

By the time Yu Qing discovered it, Han Li had already appeared below the silver circular mirror, holding a green bamboo sword, Qingyun, surrounded by golden lightning. He struck the mirror's surface with a powerful blow.

However, almost simultaneously, the silver mirror's surface changed again, releasing a blue radiance that contained a powerful water attribute law.

Han Li's sword struck the mirror's surface, but it was like hitting a vast ocean. Although it created a massive wave, it was eventually dispersed by the residual ripples.

However, Han Li's sword had been imbued with his full strength, causing the mirror's surface to shudder violently. The mirror's interior was also affected, with a powerful shockwave that struck the surrounding ten Heavenly Palace guards.

The guards were mostly at the Taiyi initial stage, with stable cultivation foundations. However, they were still shaken by the impact, stumbling and struggling to maintain their balance.

But with the mirror's assistance, they were able to withstand Han Li's attack.

Just as they were about to breathe a sigh of relief, a burst of golden lightning exploded from Han Li's sword, releasing a series of powerful golden lightning balls that struck the silver circular mirror.

Thick, golden lightning bolts shot out from the mirror, transforming into lightning whips that swept across the area.

The ten Heavenly Palace guards were unable to dodge, and they were struck by the lightning, crying out in pain as they fell to the ground.

The silver circular mirror, no longer being controlled, shook violently, its light extinguished, and it fell to the ground.

Han Li didn't even bother to catch the mirror, shouting in his mind: "Now, let's go!"

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot upwards, heading towards the highest point in the sky. Jin Tong and Xiao Bai followed, flying in a different direction.

However, just as they were about to escape, a figure appeared in the sky, raising a foot to stomp down on the ground.

"Where are you going?" Yu Qing's voice thundered, his foot already stomping down on the void.

A deafening explosion shook the heavens, and the void trembled violently.
Han Li felt a powerful pressure descending from the sky, forcing him to plummet downwards and crash back onto the surface of the Jade Vase Peak.

The entire peak shook violently, as if it had been struck by an earthquake. The local cultivators and disciples of the Ti Hu Mountain, who were gathered around the peak, were affected by the aftershocks and fell from the sky like dumplings.

The elderly ancestor of the Ti Hu Mountain, who was quite perceptive, had already retreated a thousand feet away with the palace master of the Chu Yu Xian Palace. Although he was able to maintain his balance, he was clearly pained by the sight of the smoke and dust rising from the Jade Vase Peak.

The grand hall at the summit of the Jade Vase Peak had been completely destroyed. Han Li stood amidst the ruins, looking up to see that the Golden Boy and the White Child had been intercepted by the two Celestial Enforcers. Not a single one of them had managed to escape.

Just then, Yue Qing's figure descended from the sky and landed not far from Han Li.

Without employing any divine abilities, Yue Qing's physical body alone was enough to cause the entire Jade Vase Peak to tremble violently.

This scene made Han Li's heart tighten.

"Your Profound Body is quite impressive," Yue Qing said, his eyes scanning Han Li from head to toe.

"Thank you, seniors," Han Li replied humbly.

"But I wonder if it can withstand a test?" Yue Qing sneered, stomping his foot once more.

The entire Jade Vase Peak shook violently, and a layer of yellow dust erupted, spreading outwards and enveloping half of the Ti Hu Mountain.

Han Li, who was within the affected area, felt as if the surrounding space was being covered by a dense, earth-attribute law. The dust that had fallen on him became incredibly heavy, causing his feet to sink into the ground.

"Ah, the Celestial Enforcers are fighting, and we're caught in the crossfire... Never mind, let's leave!"

The elderly ancestor of the Ti Hu Mountain sighed, knowing that their ancestral foundation was doomed. He led his disciples and elders in retreating from the sect, followed by the cultivators of the Chu Yu Xian Palace.

In an instant, the only ones left in the Ti Hu Mountain were Han Li and the cultivators of the Jin Yuan Xian Palace.

However, the ten Celestial Enforcers had already retreated to a distance of a thousand miles, no longer participating in the battle. They had handed the battlefield over to Yue Qing and the two Celestial Enforcers.

Han Li's gaze shifted slightly, glancing at the other side of the battlefield. He saw that the Golden Boy was fighting against an old man named Wu Hui, exchanging blows in a fierce battle. The outcome was still uncertain, while the White Child was struggling against a woman.

Han Li's current cultivation had improved significantly, but it was mainly due to the power of his bloodline. He lacked experience in actual combat, and his strength was only at six-tenths of its potential.

"You're worrying about others in the midst of battle?" A mocking voice sounded.

Han Li knew he was in trouble. A golden glow erupted from his body, forming a time domain that enveloped the entire Jade Vase Peak.

However, before his time domain could take effect, a figure appeared behind him, its hand pressing down on his shoulder.

Han Li felt as if a mountain was crushing him, his bones cracking like exploding beans. He gritted his teeth, his body sinking into the ground.

At the same time, the ground beneath him lit up with a yellow glow, and a powerful suction force emerged, pulling him downwards.

Han Li's heart tightened, and he let out a loud shout. His body's Tian Xia Town Prison technique activated, and his acupoints lit up with starlight. He burst out of the ground, his arms shaking with power.

The yellow glow enveloping the ground shattered, and Han Li's figure emerged, his sword flashing as he struck back at Yue Qing.

Yue Qing sneered, his fingers dancing in the air as he conjured a yellow energy that clashed with Han Li's sword.

The energy ripped through Han Li's sword, and Yue Qing's palm flashed with a blue light, summoning a massive sword with golden runes etched onto its surface.

The sword was enormous, with a presence that felt like a mountain range. Yue Qing swung it in a wide arc, and the sword sliced through the air, heading straight for Han Li.

As the sword descended, the surrounding space was filled with an intense, suffocating pressure that seemed to crush Han Li in place.

Han Li's body felt heavy, as if he was being pressed down by a mountain. He couldn't dodge, only able to endure the attack.

He switched to a two-handed grip on his sword, holding it horizontally above his head. His body began to glow with a golden light as his Tian Xia Town Prison technique and his True Spirit Bloodline activated.

Just as he was about to transform into a three-headed, six-armed demon, the massive sword came crashing down, its power like a mountain range.
