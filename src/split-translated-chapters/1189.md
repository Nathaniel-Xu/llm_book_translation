"Little White, don't be reckless, now that the Ink Eye Pixiu bloodline only has you as its successor, you absolutely cannot get into trouble again." White Ze said in a deep voice.

Little White opened his mouth, about to say something, but was stopped by White Ze's waving hand.

"You and Han Xiao want to do what, I already know. What is the Nine Yuan Observatory? I'm more clear about it than you, its power and foundation are far beyond what you can imagine. Just the two of you wanting to sneak in to rescue someone is no different from seeking death. You should stay on the Eight Desolations Mountain and cultivate well, the revival of the Desolate Region concerns the lives of countless living beings, and this place needs you more. Han Xiao, I advise you not to take risks, this move is nine deaths and one life."

White Ze's face turned even more serious as he exhorted them, then turned to Han Li.

"Han fellow, forgive me for speaking bluntly, the Nine Yuan Observatory is one of the top five powers among the various forces allied with the Heavenly Court, it's not something you two can easily offend."

Li Qi Ma, who was standing beside him, also spoke up to advise them.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed slightly, wanting to speak but hesitating.

If it were just him and Little White, wanting to charge into the Nine Yuan Observatory to rescue Jintong would be a reckless move, he would never do such a foolish thing. After all, as long as he had a chance to escape, he wouldn't worry about not having a chance to rescue Jintong.

But now that the Wheel of Reincarnation had joined the fray, the situation was different. However, this was a secret, and he couldn't reveal it, so he remained silent.

"Cultivation can be done anywhere, Master has a space treasure, I can cultivate with him, it won't be delayed. As for danger, I'm not afraid." Little White said nonchalantly, his attitude resolute.

White Ze's eyebrows were tightly furrowed, his gaze turned to Han Li.

"Little White, White Ze's words have some truth to them, the rescue mission is too reckless, following me would be unsafe, it's better to stay here." Han Li sighed and advised.

Little White had already advanced to the Great Luo stage, but facing the Nine Yuan Observatory, a massive power, his abilities were still limited. Moreover, the Heavenly Court monitored the world, and the Eight Desolations Mountain's matters were unlikely to be unknown to them. Little White's inheritance of the Ink Eye Pixiu's bloodline made him more valuable, if he appeared in the Jinyuan Sacred Realm, the Heavenly Court might send experts to capture him, adding variables to the situation.

More importantly, taking Little White away would offend the Desolate Region, it was better to leave him here.

"Back then, I and Elder Sister encountered the Nine Yuan Observatory's siege, Elder Sister had the opportunity to escape, but she gave it to me. Otherwise, there wouldn't be today's me. Now she's trapped in the Nine Yuan Observatory, her life and death unknown, how can I hide in the Desolate Region? King, your kindness I appreciate, but this time I must rescue Elder Sister, otherwise, I'll always feel guilty, and my cultivation will never progress." Little White's expression was calm, but his eyes were resolute, his tone firm.

Hearing Little White's words, Han Li's face flashed with a hint of surprise, but he didn't say anything.

But White Ze's eyebrows were furrowed even tighter, wanting to say something.

"White Ze, we Desolate Region people repay kindness and revenge, if Little White insists on going, let him go." Yue Meng walked over and said.

"What are you saying, the Nine Yuan Observatory's power is not something you don't know, you're not aware of it?" White Ze turned to Yue Meng, his tone slightly reproachful.

"If Little White's heart is not in the Desolate Region, forcing him to stay here is useless. This cause and effect must be resolved. And Han Xiao doesn't seem like a reckless person, you must have some plan to rescue your companion, right?" Yue Meng's tone was calm, then turned to Han Li.

"I have indeed made some preparations, but the matter is confidential, so I won't reveal it. However, you can rest assured, I won't act rashly." Han Li's expression was calm, bowing to White Ze and Yue Meng.

"See, since Han Xiao has made preparations, he must have some confidence. If you're still worried, give him a few treasures to protect himself." Yue Meng said to White Ze.

"...Alright, since you insist on going, I won't stop you. Take these three treasures with you." White Ze was silent for a moment, then finally relented, taking out three objects and handing them to Little White.

The three objects were a blue jade symbol, a gold talisman, and a white cloth bag.

The blue jade symbol was three inches wide and five inches long, with a peculiar pattern of blue flowers and a mysterious array of characters.

A soft blue light rose from the array, surrounding the jade symbol and flying around it in a circle, before returning to the symbol, repeating the cycle endlessly.

The gold talisman was the size of a palm, with countless twisted demonic symbols, emitting a powerful aura.

The white cloth bag was ordinary-looking, without any special features or powerful aura, only a faint hint of spiritual energy attached to it.

"This blue jade symbol is called the 'Evade Heaven Symbol', a rare treasure I obtained before I reached the Dao. It has the power of invisibility and concealing one's aura, even a Great Luo stage cultivator might not be able to see through it. This gold talisman contains 30% of my power, if you encounter a powerful enemy, you can use it to counterattack. As for the white cloth bag, it's a treasure your father created, a life-bound artifact that I've kept here, now that you've inherited his bloodline, I'll give it to you to keep." White Ze explained the uses of the three treasures.

"Thank you, King." Little White sensed the extraordinary nature of the three treasures and eagerly accepted them.

He glanced at the Evade Heaven Symbol and the gold talisman, then put them away, only leaving the white cloth bag to examine it carefully.
Han Li's eyes lit up as he saw the scene before him, and his heart felt a surge of joy.

With these three treasures in hand, their safety had been secured.

Just then, Bai Ze suddenly raised his hand and waved it, and twelve flashes of white light shot out from his hand, accurately entering Xiao Bai's body, and countless white symbols flew out from the light, gathering around Xiao Bai's body in a circular formation, flashing a few times before slowly disappearing.

Xiao Bai was shocked, and Han Li's face also changed, but Bai Ze had acted too quickly, and they had no time to stop him.

"You don't need to worry, this is the Twelve Great Translocation Symbol Array I've set up," Bai Ze said solemnly. "Xiao Bai, I can agree to let you leave with Han Xiao, but as you know, the current situation in the Heavenly Court and the Barbarian Realm is precarious, and we are preparing for some things... so you only have 200 years, 200 years later, no matter what reason you have, you must return to the Barbarian Realm, or else this Twelve Great Translocation Symbol Array will forcibly transport you back."

"200 years!" Xiao Bai's face changed, and he looked at Han Li.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed as he heard this, and he thought to himself that the Revolving Hall had not given him any news, and he didn't know when they would make their move.

Although he didn't put his hopes on the Revolving Hall, if they were to take action, it would definitely be a great help to him.

"I hope I can make it," Han Li sighed inwardly, nodding at Xiao Bai.

"Alright, I'll definitely return in 200 years," Xiao Bai said to Bai Ze.

Bai Ze nodded, his face slightly relaxing.

"Thank you, Bai Ze, for allowing Xiao Bai to accompany me," Han Li said to Bai Ze and Yue Meng. "You can rest assured, no matter what happens, I will ensure Xiao Bai's safety."

"Alright, Xiao Bai is in your care," Bai Ze said to Han Li.

The group chatted for a while, and then Han Li bid farewell and left, using the Ink Dragon Flying Boat to carry the two of them away, turning into a streak of dark green light that disappeared into the distance.

As they watched Han Li and Xiao Bai leave, Bai Ze glanced at Li Qi Ma beside him.

Li Qi Ma understood, bid farewell, and turned to leave, leaving only Bai Ze and Yue Meng on the square.

"Here," Yue Meng waved his hand, and a ball of blood light flew out, landing in front of Bai Ze.

The blood light flashed with twelve virtual shadows, which were the twelve true spirit bloodline shadows within Han Li's body, intertwining and swirling.

Apart from these twelve true spirit shadows, the blood light also flashed with many blood-colored characters, condensing into a cultivation technique.

If Han Li were here, he would be shocked, because this cultivation technique was identical to the main vein of the Jing Qian Jue he had been cultivating, with only some minor differences.

Bai Ze's eyes lit up, and he waved his hand to grasp the blood light. "I used the Kun Peng bloodline within Han Li's body to sense the operation of the other bloodlines, and I've roughly understood the main vein of the cultivation technique he's been cultivating. It's indeed a very high-level technique, but I don't know why it's appeared in the lower realm."

Yue Meng spoke slowly, "Indeed, it's very high-level. In our eight tribes, there are some cultivation techniques that fuse true spirit bloodlines, but at most, they only fuse four or five true spirit bloodlines. If there are more, the true spirit bloodlines will conflict with each other, causing the body to explode. This cultivation technique can fuse twelve true spirit bloodlines, and the balance and coordination between each bloodline is truly remarkable. With this technique, the tribes of the Barbarian Realm can increase their strength significantly."

"You want this technique, why not just search Han Li's soul or make him hand it over directly?" Yue Meng snorted, unhappy. "Why use such a roundabout method, and make me play along with this farce?"

"That Han Li is not an ordinary person, we can't touch him," Bai Ze said calmly, shaking his head.

"Oh, who is that kid? Why are you being so cautious?" Yue Meng asked curiously.

Bai Ze looked at Yue Meng, took out a black token, and showed it to him. On the token was a ferocious beast face.

"It's him!" Yue Meng's face changed as he saw the token.

"The wind and clouds of the True Immortal Realm are about to rise, and I don't know where they will flow..." Bai Ze put the token away, gazing at the distant clouds, sighing.
