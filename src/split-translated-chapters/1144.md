Han Li ignored the words of Miao Fa Xian Zun and continued to activate his technique, resisting the increasingly cold air around him. He glanced around at the six ice mirrors surrounding him.

After a moment, he suddenly had an idea and raised his hand, and a small, seven-colored flame appeared in his palm. A small, silver flame man emerged and floated in his hand.

Han Li then looked around at the ice mirrors and saw that only his own reflection was visible, with no sign of the Jing Yan Huo Niao.

"It seems that this ice mirror, condensed from the power of ice attributes, cannot reflect the image of fire attributes. That makes things easier," Han Li thought to himself, and raised a finger to point at one of the ice mirrors.

The silver flame man moved in tandem with Han Li's thoughts and transformed into a flame that wrapped around his arm and shot out from his fingertips, drilling into the mirror like a fire drill.

As expected, the seemingly indestructible ice mirror began to melt, its surface rippling like a lake.

"Hmph! You think you're so great with your Jing Yan Huo Niao, but you won't have the chance to come out again," Miao Fa Xian Zun said, her eyebrows furrowed in annoyance, as she descended towards the ice mirror.

Just then, the air around them suddenly shook violently, and a warm breeze blew in from the southeast.

Miao Fa Xian Zun's descent was halted, and she flew back up to the ice crystal city wall, gazing out into the distance.

A figure clad in red was approaching from the southeast, riding a cloud of flames.

As the figure moved, the sky behind her changed, with a massive wave of flames rolling in like a tidal wave. The air in the surrounding space grew hotter and more oppressive.

Miao Fa Xian Zun's expression turned cold as she sensed the figure's aura.

The figure in red stopped in front of the ice crystal city and gazed over at Miao Fa Xian Zun.

"Ah, I thought it was someone else. It's Miao Fa Xian Zun! I'm looking for a fugitive from the Tian Xian Bang. Have you seen him?" the figure asked, pretending to be surprised.

"There's only one person here, a prisoner from the Jiuyuan Guan. I've already apprehended him, and you can look elsewhere for your fugitive," Miao Fa Xian Zun replied coldly.

The figure in red was none other than Chi Meng Xian Zi, who had also come to capture Han Li.

"That's quite a coincidence. The person I'm looking for is also a wanted fugitive on the Tian Xian Bang. Since you've caught him, it's only fitting that you hand him over to me. I'll make sure to reward you and the Jiuyuan Guan for your troubles," Chi Meng Xian Zi said with a smile.

"Things don't work that way. Since I caught him first, I'll take him back to the Jiuyuan Guan for trial. Once we've finished questioning him, we'll hand him over to you. Isn't the Tian Xian Bang supposed to be strict about following rules?" Miao Fa Xian Zun retorted.

"Ah, but are you certain you've caught him?" Chi Meng Xian Zi asked, her eyes glinting with amusement.

Miao Fa Xian Zun's expression changed, and she frowned.

Behind the ice crystal city wall, a swarm of red fire ants suddenly emerged from the ground, surrounding the ice mirror that held Han Li captive. The ants were covered in a sticky, flaming substance that burned everything they touched, leaving deep gashes in the ground.

The ice mirror, however, was imbued with the power of ice attributes, and the fire ants were unable to penetrate it. The ants' flames were extinguished, and they were frozen into ice crystals.

Despite this, the sheer number of ants made them a formidable force. Han Li, trapped inside the ice mirror, was unaware of the commotion outside, but he continued to try and break free using the Jing Yan Huo Niao's power.

Just as his body was about to be frozen solid, his finger, wrapped in silver flames, finally broke through the ice mirror.

Han Li's eyes lit up, and he summoned all his strength to punch through the broken ice mirror.

The sound of shattering ice filled the air as the six ice mirrors surrounding Han Li broke apart, and he emerged from the wreckage.

Han Li saw that the ice mirror shards were still intact, and a new wave of fire ants was approaching him. He didn't have time to react, and he leapt into the air, attempting to flee.

As he did, he caught sight of Miao Fa Xian Zun's figure, surrounded by a whirlwind of snow and ice, descending from the city wall to pursue him.
Han Li's heart was shocked, and he quickly reversed the True Speech Treasure Wheel inside his body, his figure rapidly retreating to avoid the attack.

At this moment, behind the Miao Fa Immortal, another figure appeared, a fiery red person who was chasing after him with a smile on her face, shouting loudly:

"Since the Immortal couldn't capture this person, then let's see who's first and who's last...!"

As soon as she finished speaking, a golden light flashed beneath her feet, and the entire cloud of fire seemed to ignite, shooting out flames that carried her figure forward, instantly surpassing Miao Fa Immortal and keeping pace with Han Li.

Han Li's heart was filled with despair, he really hadn't expected that a Da Luo middle-stage cultivator would already be giving him a headache, and now another Da Luo middle-stage cultivator was also claiming to want to kill him.

Chi Meng chased after him and raised her hand, her five white fingers grasping, and a flame dragon appeared in her palm, its mouth open wide as it bit towards Han Li.

Although the flame dragon hadn't immediately approached, its intense burning power had already invaded the surrounding space, causing it to distort slightly.

Han Li felt his breathing become stifled, and his figure, which had been advancing, was slowed down by the invisible force in front of him.

Just as he was about to be enveloped by the flame dragon's intense flames, a silver flame rose from his shoulder, rushing towards his arm.

Han Li immediately raised his hand and waved it, and a giant fire bird's head appeared on his arm, its mouth open wide as it bit towards the flame dragon.

The Jing Yan Fire Bird's bite was so powerful that it bit off half of the dragon's head, and its body retreated back.

However, the flames on the dragon's body didn't immediately disappear, but instead continued to struggle violently, spewing out flames everywhere.

Han Li felt his entire arm burning, the pain unbearable, but he could only grit his teeth and endure.

Seeing the Jing Yan Fire Bird's actions, Chi Meng's expression didn't change, but instead, she smiled and said: "Ah, you actually have a Jing Yan Fire Bird, and it's even swallowed a seven-colored fire sand... this little guy, I'll take him..."

As soon as she finished speaking, she condensed her gaze, and her body's flames surged, her figure instantly approaching Han Li.

As soon as she drew near, Han Li felt his skin burning, his blood boiling, and his body's spiritual energy becoming increasingly unstable.

Han Li's face turned red, his eyes filled with bloodshot eyes, and his body's spiritual energy became more and more violent.

"Young people should be hot-blooded, come... let me add some fuel to the fire." Chi Meng smiled and said, her hands weaving a spell.

As she spoke, Han Li felt the temperature around him rise by at least ten times, a white light bursting forth from beneath his feet, covering an area of a thousand meters, with a three-legged golden crow's figure appearing in the center, surrounded by intense flames.

Han Li's figure was instantly engulfed by the flames, as if he had been thrown into a alchemist's furnace, unable to escape no matter how hard he struggled.

Fortunately, the Jing Yan Fire Bird had already transformed into a layer of flames that covered his body, protecting him from the intense heat.

However, even so, Han Li still felt the heat unbearable, his soul on the verge of shattering.

Just as he was about to be consumed by the flames, a clear cry suddenly echoed through the air!

A giant ice phoenix appeared out of thin air, its wings spread wide as it flew towards them, its wings creating a whirlwind that carried extreme cold and snow.

The flames surrounding Han Li immediately sensed the ice phoenix's approach and began to rotate violently, shooting out flames that clashed with the ice phoenix.

In an instant, the surrounding air was filled with steam, and the temperature dropped rapidly.

"Immortal Miao Fa, it seems that the Nine Yuan Sect is determined to oppose me, and oppose the Heavenly Court?" Chi Meng's eyebrows rose, her gaze fixed on the approaching Miao Fa Immortal, her voice cold.

"I had already captured him, but you ruined the rules, so don't blame me for retaliating." Miao Fa Immortal's face remained expressionless, her voice cold.

"Fine, since we're not willing to give in, let's settle this between us. Whoever wins gets to take him away, and whoever loses will retreat, how about that?" Chi Meng smiled.

"Exactly what I had in mind." Miao Fa Immortal glanced at her, her voice even.

As the two of them spoke, Han Li's body began to calm down, the flames surrounding him weakening.

Han Li felt his body relax, but his heart remained tense.

This was his only chance!
