Everyone, regardless of whether there is a Golden Power Field inside, we should be cautious. So why don't we split into two teams and enter the great hall one after another?

Jin Liu hesitated for a moment before speaking.

"But how do we determine the order of entry?" Yu Kuohai raised an eyebrow and asked.

"Those who cultivate Golden Attribute techniques and those who are skilled in sealing arrays will form the vanguard team, entering the hall first. If there is indeed a sealing array within, those skilled in breaking seals will remove the restriction, and the second team will follow," Jin Liu said.

"Jin Liu, this method may be good, but it's unfair. Our Sect Master has cultivated Golden Attribute techniques, so wouldn't we be making them go first to test the waters?" Zhao Vice-Sect Master stepped forward and said.

"Zhao, don't worry, the vanguard team will receive any benefits, regardless of whether there is a sealing array inside. As for the second team, we will provide support from outside and aid you if anything goes wrong," Jin Liu replied.

"If that's the case, then it's reasonable," Zhao Vice-Sect Master thought for a moment before saying.

"This time, the vanguard team will be composed of those who cultivate Golden Attribute techniques from Lietu City, our Sect, and Tian Shui Sect. As for Ling Xiao Gate, Mo Xiang Lou, and Qing Su Valley, you can choose a few skilled in breaking seals to join us," Jin Liu said after a moment of consideration.

Everyone nodded in agreement, finding the plan reasonable.

Han Li watched as Yu Kuohai walked towards him, knowing he would be asked to join the vanguard team. Han Li didn't refuse, but he was surprised when Yu Kuohai also decided to join.

After each faction selected their representatives, a team of less than a hundred people was formed.

"I originally thought we should choose a leader for the vanguard team, but I didn't expect Yu, Yang, and Zhao to volunteer. It's a pleasant surprise," Jin Liu said with a smile.

"Hmph, how could I, as the leader of this expedition, wait outside while my Sect members enter?" Zhao Vice-Sect Master said with a sense of righteousness.

The people from his Sect looked at him with admiration in their eyes.

"I, too, will enter the hall with my Sect members. We will advance and retreat together," Yang Long said, stepping forward.

"We, Ling Xiao Gate, don't primarily cultivate Golden Attribute techniques, but I, Yu Kuohai, will join the vanguard team with Shi," Yu Kuohai added.

Han Li listened to their words, smiling inwardly.

In the end, these people were all trying to enter the hall first to gain an advantage in obtaining the treasure. As for whether it was a Golden Power Field inside, they either thought they could handle it or were being reckless.

Han Li didn't care about this, but what caught his attention was the "Lan siblings" who were also part of the vanguard team.

Earlier, when they broke the array, they didn't reveal anything. Han Li wondered what would happen once they entered the hall.

Lan Yuanshi was talking to Lan Yan when he suddenly sensed someone's gaze on him. He frowned and turned around, but the gaze had already moved away.

"What's wrong, brother?" Lan Yan asked, puzzled.

"Nothing, it was just my imagination," Lan Yuanshi replied with a smile.

"What if there's treasure inside?" Lan Yan asked, switching to a transmission.

"If there is, I'll take it and give it to you," Lan Yuanshi replied.

"I'll take care of those annoying people, and you can take care of obtaining the treasure. I'll kill them all," Lan Yan said, her face still smiling.

"They're not worth killing yet. We can use them as cannon fodder," Lan Yuanshi transmitted.

Lan Yan's face scrunched up in distaste, and she replied, "But I don't want to keep pretending to be this ugly girl. I want to kill them all."

"Even if you kill them, you'll still have to maintain your disguise. Who else would you show your true self to?" Lan Yuanshi asked.

"Only you, brother. You're the only one worthy of seeing me," Lan Yan replied, smiling.

"Besides, in my eyes, you're the most beautiful woman in the world. Whether you're in disguise or not, it doesn't matter," Lan Yuanshi said, his eyes warm with affection.

Lan Yan's face turned red, and she looked at him with admiration.

After a brief adjustment, the two teams approached the entrance to the hall, where golden light was emanating from within.
The group of cultivators walked forward, their movements swift and silent. Jing Liu nodded and said, "Don't worry, we've got your backs. We won't let anything happen to you."

Su Zhenzi's eyes were cold and expressionless, her face a mask of calmness. She seemed to be thinking deeply, but her thoughts were impossible to discern.

Yu Kuohai exchanged a glance with Yang Lao, and they both nodded in unison. With a wave of his hand, he led the group, including Han Li, towards the entrance.

The group from Wangyou Pavilion followed closely behind, entering the doorway in a swift and orderly manner.

As soon as they crossed the threshold, they were enveloped by a blinding golden light. Their figures disappeared from view, and even their auras became difficult to detect.

Han Li walked behind Yu Kuohai, and as soon as he stepped into the new space, he felt a sudden constriction around him. A powerful binding force emanated from all directions, restricting his movements.

This binding force was different from the heavy pressure of the earth element or the sticky sensation of the water element. It was as if he was being wrapped in a multitude of thin, yet incredibly resilient metal threads.

Accompanying this force was a series of sharp, bone-cutting golden winds that blew towards him, making his skin prickle with pain.

The golden light that permeated the air made it difficult for anyone to see clearly, and even the cultivators' vision was affected. The view became hazy and indistinct, as if shrouded in a layer of golden mist.

"What's going on? This feeling... Could it be..." Zhao Fuyuan's voice trembled as he exclaimed.

Yang Lao's face turned pale, and he let out a bitter laugh. "It seems that Su Xianzi was right. This is indeed a Golden Force Field."

With a flick of his wrist, he produced a golden orb and placed it on his chest. A golden arc of light burst forth, protecting him from the Golden Force Field's influence.

Even with his cultivation level, Yang Lao still needed to rely on a treasure to withstand the effects of the Golden Force Field. The others were not as fortunate, and their faces contorted in pain as they struggled to resist the force.

Yu Kuohai formed a hand seal, and a series of golden patterns emerged on his body, shielding him from the Golden Force Field's influence. However, his internal spiritual energy was being depleted at an alarming rate.

"This Golden Force Field is incredibly powerful. I've never seen anything like it before. It must be reinforced by a powerful formation. Quickly, go and find the formation's eye and foot, and destroy it!" Yu Kuohai's expression turned grave as he pointed at Han Li and the others.

Han Li, although affected by the Golden Force Field, did not feel as much pain as the others. His physical body was far more resilient, and he only pretended to be in discomfort to maintain his cover.

"We can't even take a step forward in this Golden Force Field... Brother Yu, it's not that I'm unwilling to help, but..." Han Li's words were cut off by Yu Kuohai's brusque interruption.

"Enough! Hurry up and go! If we don't destroy this formation, we'll never be able to obtain the treasure. We'll all be trapped here and eventually die!" Yu Kuohai's anger was palpable.

Han Li let out a forced sigh and pretended to be reluctant. "Fine... I'll go and take a look."

As he walked forward, he discovered that his spiritual sense was severely limited, unable to perceive the surroundings beyond a hundred paces. Even his Nine Underworlds Devil Eyes were restricted, unable to see the full extent of the space.

He proceeded forward, his footsteps echoing in the silence, until he came across a massive golden stone pillar. The pillar was adorned with intricate symbols that flashed with golden light, emitting a strange, pulsating energy.

"Could this be one of the Golden Force Field's formation feet?" Han Li muttered to himself.

He reached out and touched the pillar, feeling a surge of sharp energy flow into his fingertips.

As he looked up, he saw that the pillar was embedded in the golden light, making it impossible to discern its full extent. However, he could see that the top of the pillar seemed to be adorned with a pair of wings, belonging to a strange, two-winged beast. The wings' sharp tips protruded from the golden light, gleaming with an otherworldly aura.

Just as Han Li was about to examine the symbols on the pillar more closely, a sudden, piercing cry echoed above him. The two-winged beast, which had seemed like a mere carving, suddenly came to life and swooped down towards him.

Han Li dodged to the side, narrowly avoiding the beast's attack. The beast's wings sliced through the air, leaving a trail of glittering golden light in its wake. The air itself seemed to be torn apart, revealing a glimpse of the void beyond.

As Han Li retreated, he caught a glimpse of the beast's true form â€“ a magnificent, golden bird with wings as sharp as knives. Its body seemed to be made of a metallic material, and its aura was even more powerful than the two metal beasts Han Li had encountered earlier.

The golden bird's wings beat the air once, and it launched itself at Han Li, its talons extended. A blast of golden energy shot towards him, threatening to tear him apart.

Han Li's hand flashed, and a golden sword appeared in his grasp. The sword, adorned with golden threads, blocked the bird's attack, but the force of the blow sent it trembling.

The golden bird's wings beat the air once more, and it launched itself at Han Li, its beak snapping wildly.
