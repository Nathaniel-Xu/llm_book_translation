Qing Dian gazed at Liu Le Er's figure and the transformed scale in her hand, seemingly finally recognizing her identity. However, when his gaze fell upon Han Li, his eyes grew increasingly dark.

"This is my friend. I implore you, esteemed Daoist, to look at the token and our Fox Clan's humble face, and not to dwell on past grievances. Let them enter the city with me," Liu Le Er said with a smile, putting away the token.

Qing Dian's face broke into a mocking smile as he replied, "I've long heard that your Fox Clan is fond of being ambiguous with humans. Now, it seems that this statement is indeed true. The person beside you has undoubtedly infiltrated our Savage Domain with ulterior motives, yet you're going to great lengths to protect him. Could it be that you're planning to rebel against the Savage Tribes?"

Liu Le Er's expression changed ever so slightly as she replied, "Your words are unreasonable, esteemed Daoist. To place such a large hat on my head, I dare not accept."

The Savage Tribes' disdain for humans was something Liu Le Er was well aware of. Qing Dian's revelation of Han Li's human identity was equivalent to pushing him towards death.

As expected, the surrounding crowd's expressions changed upon hearing that Han Li was human. Some looked at him with suspicion, while others glared at him with hostility.

Even Sang Tu and Yun Bao, who were standing by the carriage, looked over at Han Li with complex expressions.

As for Han Li's identity, they had indeed harbored doubts, but they had been unwilling to acknowledge them. On one hand, it was due to his strength, and on the other hand, without Han Li, they might not have had the opportunity to come to the Savage Domain.

Just recently, Han Li had saved them, so they felt a mix of fear, reverence, and gratitude towards him.

"You're called Qing Dian, right? Food can be eaten carelessly, but words cannot be spoken carelessly. My true spirit bloodline is not something that can be faked, so why would you say I'm human?" Han Li's expression remained unchanged as he coldly replied.

"The transmission of bloodlines is not limited to a single method, and humans have frequently stolen the bloodlines of demonic beasts and true spirits over the years. Although you possess a true spirit bloodline, it doesn't mean you're one of our Savage Tribes. Moreover, when she presented the transformed scale earlier, you didn't even pay respects. This shows that you have no reverence for the True Spirit King, and you're definitely not one of our Savage Tribes," Qing Dian coldly retorted.

"You've analyzed... with some reason, but it's all just wild speculation. I'll only ask you one question: if I were a spy sent by humans, would I be able to possess this object?" Han Li said with a smile, nodding his head.

As he spoke, he flipped his palm, and a flash of light appeared, revealing another transformed scale identical to the one Liu Le Er had presented earlier.

"Another transformed scale...!" someone in the crowd exclaimed.

"Could it be fake?"

"Is this person also someone trusted by the True Spirit King?"

The crowd was shocked once again, and even Liu Le Er's eyes flickered with surprise.

However, this time, only a portion of the crowd bowed in respect, while the rest remained still, their eyes filled with doubt.

"Hmph, what a joke! Your token must be fake, and the True Spirit King's tokens only number seven. How could it be so coincidental that two of them appear here at the same time?" Qing Dian's expression turned stern as he loudly declared.

"This object is genuine or not, you should be clear about it in your heart. You've said it yourself, there are only seven tokens. Who has the ability to forge a token that's identical in every aspect, including its aura?" Liu Le Er solemnly replied.

Qing Dian's expression faltered for a moment, but he still refused to give in.

"The object has been shown to you, and if you don't move aside, don't blame me for not considering your Qing Yuan Clan's face," Han Li coldly said.

"Oh, I'll see about that! I'll see whether you can crush my Qing Yuan Clan's face or whether I can unmask your true identity!" Qing Dian seemed to have made up his mind, saying.

Han Li's gaze narrowed as he scanned the surroundings. Qing Dian's brief moment of hesitation earlier was likely due to someone's secret instructions.

That person was able to remain resolute in the face of the token, which suggested that they were confident in their ability to determine Han Li's human identity. Such a person was likely a powerful being of the Great Luo level.

With this thought, Han Li became more cautious and transmitted a message to Liu Le Er, saying, "Things will likely become chaotic here soon, and my identity may be exposed. It's not safe for you to stay by my side, so please return to your Fox Clan. After you escape, I'll find a way to contact you."

Unexpectedly, Liu Le Er smiled and replied, "Stone Brother, I'm not the same little girl who used to hide behind you. Don't worry, even if a fight breaks out, I have the ability to protect myself."

Han Li's heart stirred as he thought about her background as a member of the Savage Domain's Sixteen Great Savage Tribes, the Fox Clan. He felt a bit more at ease.

"You're courting death, yet you still don't know it. Come and meet your demise!"

Qing Dian's eyes grew more jealous as he watched Han Li and Liu Le Er's exchange, and he charged forward with a loud shout.

As he took each step, a dark red glow spread from his feet, causing the entire city wall to tremble. The crowd retreated, clearing a space in the middle, leaving only Han Li and Liu Le Er standing.
Han Li's gaze suddenly focused, and he saw that Qing Dian's eyes had turned bright red, and the skin on his body was covered in ancient, crimson-colored patterns, emitting a fierce, bloodthirsty aura.

At the same time, his body had only grown slightly larger, not as exaggerated as Qing Dian's, but his face had undergone a more noticeable change, with his nose shrinking, his mouth protruding, and two massive fangs extending from his mouth, making him look even more like a ferocious, white-haired ape.

As Qing Dian charged forward, Han Li's eyes suddenly locked onto him, and he took a step forward, blocking Liu Le'er behind him.

Liu Le'er was about to do something, but she felt a gentle, unseen force push her body backward, and she landed steadily hundreds of feet away.

Han Li's hands suddenly shot forward, and the air around him was filled with thunderous roars, as silver-colored electrical threads burst forth, twisting into two massive, electrified claws that clashed with Qing Dian's fists.

A burst of electricity illuminated the air, and Han Li's body simultaneously activated the Tian Xia Zhen Yu Gong, channeling all his strength into his arms. He grabbed Qing Dian's fists, and with a fierce twist, he tried to send Qing Dian crashing to the ground.

However, Qing Dian's body was as stable as a mountain, and he didn't budge.

"Hmph, daring to compare strength with me? You're truly courting disaster," Qing Dian sneered, retracting his fists. Han Li lost control, and his hands were forced to release Qing Dian's fists.

Han Li was shocked, as his Xing Chen Twelve Transformations' power was not as strong as the Mountain Giant Ape's, but it was still formidable. Qing Dian's strength was actually beyond his own.

Before Han Li could comprehend this, Qing Dian launched a swift punch at him, striking him with incredible force.

Han Li's body flashed with silver light, and he vanished from Qing Dian's punch, reappearing behind him in the next instant.

At the same time, his hand flashed with a blue light, and a blue bamboo sword materialized, its blade crackling with electricity. A golden, electrified aura burst forth, stabbing towards Qing Dian's neck.

The attack was too fast, and Qing Dian couldn't react in time.

But as the sword struck, Qing Dian's skin glowed with a bright, crimson light, and his skin turned crystal clear.

A deafening explosion shook the air, and a brilliant, golden light erupted!

Countless electrical threads burst forth, transforming into numerous, tiny, golden snakes that shot out in all directions.

In the midst of the golden light, a strange, pulsating wave suddenly appeared, and a crimson-colored wave burst forth, hurtling towards Han Li with incredible speed.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat, and he instinctively reversed the rotation of his internal mantra, his body shifting to the side.

The crimson wave grazed his shoulder, striking the castle wall behind him.

A deafening crash shook the castle, and the wall trembled.

Han Li felt a searing pain on his shoulder, and he saw that his clothes had been torn apart, revealing a bloody, crimson-colored wound.

He examined the wound and found that a layer of crimson-colored, molten rock had attached itself to his shoulder, spreading towards his arm. The True Extreme membrane that protected his body had been breached.

As he turned to look, he saw that the castle wall behind him had also been damaged, with a gaping hole that seemed to be burning with an intense, crimson-colored flame.

Han Li's brow furrowed, and he raised his hand, a silver flame erupting from his palm. With a swift motion, he sliced away the molten rock, removing it from his shoulder.

However, despite removing the rock, Han Li still felt a lingering, strange energy within his wound, slowing down the healing process.

"Brother, don't compare strength with him, Le'er can assist you!" Liu Le'er called out from a distance.

Han Li shook his head, indicating that he was fine and didn't want her to interfere.

At the same time, an old, white-haired man stood on the castle walls, his back bowed, and his hands clasped behind his back. He gazed at Han Li with narrowed eyes, muttering to himself:

"His physique is not bad, and he's actually cultivating the Time Law. Although it's likely just a superficial understanding, it's still a Supreme Law. Qing Dian will probably need to expend some effort..."

The old man's skin was dark, with only his face being pale, and his features were deeply etched, giving him an unusual appearance. However, his aura was extremely subdued, and he blended into the surroundings.

As he pondered, the air around him began to distort, and a faint, red mist seemed to spread.

"He's even using this move, it seems there won't be any unexpected twists," the old man said with a hint of a smile.

The air around him seemed to ripple, and a strange, pulsating wave appeared, as if a red mist was spreading through the air.

"Looks like things are going as expected," the old man said, his voice barely above a whisper.
