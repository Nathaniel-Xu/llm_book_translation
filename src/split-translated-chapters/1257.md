Just as Han Li and the others were being suppressed, a ripple appeared in the golden light, and a gray-robed old man suddenly materialized out of thin air.

"Old Ancestor!" The three Pure Yang True Persons' faces lit up with joy.

Han Li and the others were shocked to hear this, and their hearts were filled with awe.

The person who could be called "Old Ancestor" by the Pure Yang True Person was none other than the legendary Nine Yang Daozu of the entire Nine Yang Palace.

The gray-robed old man ignored the Pure Yang True Person and looked at the black-clothed girl, his hand raised in a casual gesture.

The black-clothed girl's storage ring flashed with light, and the five-colored vial flew out, heading towards the gray-robed old man.

However, just as the vial was halfway there, the air above suddenly split open, and a large, dark red hand shot out, grabbing the vial.

The gray-robed old man's expression remained unchanged, and he waved his sleeve.

The golden light in the hall fluctuated, and a golden hand appeared out of thin air, grabbing towards the dark red hand.

The dark red hand moved, forming a hand seal, and six mysterious incantations appeared in the air, blocking the golden hand for a moment.

"Ah, this is..." The gray-robed old man looked at the incantations, his eyes narrowing.

The dark red hand flashed back, grabbing the black-clothed girl, Jiao San, Wu Yang, Lu Chuanfeng, and Shi Kongmo, and pulling them towards its palm.

The palm of the dark red hand created a whirlpool, sucking the five people in.

The dark red hand then shot out again, heading towards Han Li in the distance.

The gray-robed old man's face finally flashed with anger, and he raised his hand, pulling the air towards him.

A deep, ancient, and mysterious golden iron whip appeared in mid-air, flashing with a whip-like motion, striking the dark red hand.

A loud, muffled sound echoed through the hall.

The dark red hand was struck, shattering into a cloud of dark red light that dispersed into the air.

A faint hum came from the depths of the void, sounding like a mixture of pain and anger.

The dark red light suddenly contracted, disappearing into the void without a trace.

The exchange had been as swift as lightning, and even the Pure Yang True Person's high cultivation couldn't keep up.

As soon as they reacted, everything was already over.

The gray-robed old man's face was slightly solemn as he looked towards the void where the dark red hand had appeared, remaining silent and not pursuing.

After a moment, he retracted his gaze, waving his hand.

The golden light in the hall fluctuated once more, and the blue ice wall shattered.

The golden light flashed, and the Pure Yang True Person, Chi Meng, and the others regained their freedom, except for Han Li, who remained motionless.

"We pay our respects to the Old Ancestor!" The three Pure Yang True Persons bowed, their hands clasped together.

Chi Meng and Huo Yuan, who had been haughty and arrogant earlier, were now filled with trepidation and hastily bowed.

"Pure Yang, I entrusted the Nine Yang Palace to you, and it's been managed into this state?" The gray-robed old man said calmly, his voice not loud but filled with authority and coldness.

"Disciple is guilty! The Wheel of Reincarnation Palace invaded, and disciple failed to detect it early. Please, Old Ancestor, punish us!" Pure Yang True Person's body trembled as he knelt down, his voice shaking.

Yang Zhenzi and Lei Zhenzi also looked frightened and apologized.

"Enough, there are outsiders present, so let's not discuss this now. You three, withdraw and clear out the Wheel of Reincarnation Palace's people from the palace." The gray-robed old man glanced at Chi Meng and Huo Yuan, his voice light but with a hint of displeasure.

"Yes!" The three Pure Yang True Persons nodded, flying out of the hall.

"Chi Meng, Huo Yuan, my Nine Yang Palace's actions were improper, and we were invaded by the Wheel of Reincarnation Palace. You two must have laughed at us." The gray-robed old man turned to Chi Meng and Huo Yuan, a hint of a smile on his face.

"Senior, you're being too polite. The Wheel of Reincarnation Palace is a great enemy that even the entire Heavenly Court must be cautious of. Except for the Middle Earth Immortal Domain, no other immortal domain can withstand them. They launched a surprise attack, and Pure Yang Dao Friend managed to command the Nine Yang Palace's disciples to resist to this extent, which is already remarkable." Chi Meng forced a smile, choosing his words carefully.

Huo Yuan stood beside him, not daring to speak.

"Ah, is that so? In that case, he's not only innocent but also has merit." The gray-robed old man laughed loudly, his voice echoing through the hall like thunder.

The laughter grew louder, shaking the air, and Chi Meng and Huo Yuan's ears were filled with the sound of thunder. Their bodies trembled, and their minds were shaken.

Their faces changed, and their bodies were surrounded by a red glow and purple light as they hastily protected themselves with all their might.
However, there was no effect, and their souls' tremors grew even more intense, like a flame in the midst of a fierce wind, on the verge of being extinguished at any moment.

Han Li's body and soul were also violently trembling, but he was unable to use his spiritual energy to protect himself, and his pain was unbearable.

Fortunately, his physical body was incredibly resilient, and his soul was extremely powerful, so he was not in danger of falling just yet.

Just then, a red glow burst forth from Chi Meng's body, instantly enveloping her and Huo Yuan's body.

Chi Meng and Huo Yuan's faces immediately lost their look of pain, and they gasped for breath, their eyes filled with a mixture of shock and fear.

"Nine Yuan Daoist, please calm down," a red-robed old woman's voice rang out, her figure emerging from the red glow.

This old woman had a head of vibrant red hair, which was not inferior to Chi Meng's, but her face was covered in wrinkles, and she held a crane-headed staff in her hand, exuding an aura of weakness. However, her expression was sharp and fierce.

Upon seeing the red-haired old woman, the gray-robed old man's eyes flickered, and the laughter echoing in the hall gradually subsided.

Han Li let out a sigh of relief, but his mind was still on high alert, and he stared at the red-haired old woman in shock.

"Could it be that this old woman is another Daoist ancestor? She seems to have some resemblance to Chi Meng, could she be Chi Rong Daoist?" Han Li's thoughts were racing.

"Chi Rong, you've let your granddaughter trespass on my territory, coveting the treasures of the Nine Yuan Pavilion. Who is behind this?" the gray-robed old man asked coldly.

"It's indeed Chi Rong Daoist..." Han Li's eyes widened as he listened to the old man's words.

"Nine Yuan Daoist, this is all a misunderstanding. Little Meng'er was sent by the Heavenly Court to capture the Jin Xian, and Han Li, we accidentally stumbled upon this place. As for the bottle, it was just a childish curiosity. Nine Yuan Daoist, you wouldn't be so petty as to hold a grudge against a junior, would you?" the red-haired old woman said with a gentle smile.

"A simple curiosity? You think the Nine Yuan Pavilion is a place where anyone can come and go as they please?" the gray-robed old man's expression did not change, his voice still cold.

"This is indeed Little Meng'er's fault. How do you plan to deal with this, Nine Yuan Daoist?" the red-haired old woman asked, her brow furrowed.

The gray-robed old man did not respond, his eyes scanning Chi Meng and Huo Yuan.

Two golden lights shot out from his eyes, striking Chi Meng and Huo Yuan with incredible speed.

"Stop!" the red-haired old woman shouted, her staff striking out and hitting the golden light aimed at Chi Meng.

A faint sound echoed, and the golden light pierced through the staff, but its intensity was greatly reduced. It still flashed into Chi Meng's forehead, and she let out a pained cry.

The other golden light struck Huo Yuan's forehead, and he was unable to react in time.

His body trembled, and his entire body was enveloped in a brilliant golden light. The next moment, his head exploded, and his headless corpse fell to the ground.

The red-haired old woman waved her hand, and a red crystal light enveloped Chi Meng's body, reducing her cries of pain.

"You!" the red-haired old woman's face turned pale, and she glared at the gray-robed old man, her eyes flashing with a venomous light.

"I'll spare your granddaughter this time, but if she dares to cause trouble in the Nine Yuan Pavilion again, she won't be so lucky. Farewell!" the gray-robed old man sneered, and with a wave of his sleeve, a golden light enveloped Chi Meng and Huo Yuan's corpse.

In an instant, they disappeared, as if they had been transported away.

Han Li, who had witnessed the entire scene, was shocked and amazed.

This gray-robed old man seemed gentle, but his actions were ruthless. He didn't even give face to Chi Rong Daoist, and his treatment of Chi Meng was harsh.

Han Li's thoughts were racing, thinking of how to escape, but he was unable to move.

At this moment, the Nine Yuan Pavilion's old master walked towards him, his hands behind his back, and his eyes fixed on Han Li.

Han Li met his gaze, and suddenly felt like he was staring into two deep, bottomless wells, with a moonlit glow that seemed to be reflected within, but without any ripples.

The old man didn't speak, but instead walked around Han Li, as if carefully examining him.

Han Li felt a chill run down his spine, as if the old man's gaze could see through all his secrets.

Fortunately, the old man soon looked away, and with a wave of his hand, a dense golden light enveloped the entire hall, forming a golden barrier that trapped Han Li.

Han Li's eyes widened in shock, and he realized that he had never seen a spiritual domain like this before, one that could exert such immense pressure on him.

The surrounding scenery was no longer visible, and the entire space had transformed into a massive golden sphere, with a golden light that seemed to be poured into it, completely sealing off the area.

Han Li soon discovered that his connection to the outside world had been severed, and even his connection to Jin Tong and Qi Hun, as well as the Qing Zhu Sword, had been cut off by this spiritual domain.

As for the unreliable bottle spirit, he was even more impossible to contact, and Han Li's hope of relying on him to escape through the small bottle was now lost.

Han Li's thoughts were a jumble of shock and fear, and he wondered how he would be able to escape this place.
