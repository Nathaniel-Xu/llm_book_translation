That kind of divine lightning's power is enough to annihilate anyone, there's no chance of survival. Han Li's face was solemn as he replied to Lan Yan's hesitant question.

As soon as he finished speaking, he struggled to get up, but as soon as he stood up, he felt a wave of dizziness wash over him, his legs went soft, and he fell back down.

Lan Yan saw this and hurried over to help him up, but was waved off by Han Li.

"I've consumed too much, I'll just take a moment to meditate, you don't need to worry." Han Li said slowly.

After finishing speaking, he sat back down, closed his eyes, and began to meditate.

Lan Yan saw that he was really fine, so she let out a sigh of relief and stood up, looking upwards towards the top of the underground space that had completely collapsed. A patch of sunlight shone down, illuminating her and making her squint.

The sunlight cast her shadow long and stretched out, reaching all the way to Han Li's side.

The battle between Ti Hu and the other party was also nearing its end. After absorbing the last bit of residual yin energy, she let out a satisfied burp and returned to her human form.

Seeing Han Li meditating, she didn't disturb him and instead walked over to examine the ancient tome.

Lan Yan saw this and was about to go over and talk to her.

But just as she took a step forward, her body suddenly froze, and her eyes flashed with a look of incredulity.

It turned out that her body had moved, but her shadow remained in place.

At that moment, a strange phenomenon occurred.

The shadow that remained in place suddenly lit up with a dark glow, and a figure emerged from it, holding a ghost-headed dagger and stabbing straight at Han Li's chest.

His face was thin and long, his eyes cold and sinister - it was none other than Gui Ling Zi.

This sudden turn of events was too shocking, and neither Lan Yan nor Ti Hu had time to react. Gui Ling Zi's ghost-headed dagger was already mere inches away from Han Li's chest.

But Han Li seemed completely unaware, continuing to meditate with his eyes closed.

The battle earlier had exhausted him greatly.

Gui Ling Zi's eyes were wide with excitement, and his pale face flushed with a hint of red as he seemed to be savoring the moment.

But just then, Han Li suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze piercing and full of energy, and a cold smile spreading across his face.

"I knew you wouldn't give up, I've been waiting for you..."

He said with a mocking tone, his hand flashing out to grab Gui Ling Zi's neck.

"How... how is this possible?" Gui Ling Zi's ghost-headed dagger was pressed against Han Li's chest, but he couldn't push it in any further, and he muttered in disbelief.

"Earlier, I didn't have enough energy, I knew that one sword wouldn't be enough to kill you. I was thinking that if you had any sense, you'd run away, and I'd let you off. But it seems you couldn't resist taking advantage of my weakness. You're really asking for death."

Han Li sneered.

"This is the Jiuyuan Tower, you dare to kill me?" Gui Ling Zi exclaimed in shock and anger.

"I've come prepared, of course. Your cultivation is barely a tenth of what it used to be, killing you would be easy. But first, I need to search your soul."

Han Li smiled, his brow flashing with a light, and a crystal thread extended from his forehead, piercing into Gui Ling Zi's brow.

Han Li's mind stirred, and his soul-refining technique began to operate, attempting to break through Gui Ling Zi's mental seal.

"Ha ha, you think you can search my soul? You're dreaming. Since you've come uninvited, I'll give you a gift." Han Li's mind had just entered Gui Ling Zi's, but he was met with Gui Ling Zi's voice.

Han Li's heart sank, and he immediately withdrew his crystal thread, opening his eyes.

But in that instant, he saw a strange, purple-colored talisman emerge from Gui Ling Zi's brow, ignite, and transform into a purple symbol that struck his own brow.

A wave of intense pain, unlike anything he had ever experienced before, washed over him, threatening to split his skull open.

Even Han Li, who had endured countless agonies, found it difficult to bear. His hand relaxed, and he fell to the ground, clutching his head and rolling around in agony.

Gui Ling Zi took advantage of the opportunity to create some distance between them.

"What did you do?" Ti Hu asked, enraged.

"I told you, I gave him a gift. That's the Zhanshi Xian talisman I prepared for myself, to help me break through the bottleneck in the future. If I used it in the late stages of the Daluo Realm, it would be incredibly effective, surpassing countless alchemical pills and medicinal herbs. But using it on a mere Daluo Realm cultivator like him... Ha ha ha..."

Gui Ling Zi's face twisted with a sinister grin as he laughed maniacally.
"Quickly, release him!" Ti Hu screamed, charging towards him.

However, Gui Lingzi dispersed into a cloud of ghostly mist, disappearing into thin air.

This time, his battle with Han Li had left him severely injured. Even if he could maintain his current realm and avoid falling, he would never be able to make further progress and reach the late stage of the Mahayana realm. It was a luxury he could no longer afford.

If not for this, he wouldn't have used the "Zhan Shi Xian Fu" (Slashing Corpse Heavenly Symbol) on Han Li.

"Ahhh..."

A heart-wrenching scream echoed through the air as Han Li suddenly sprang to his feet, his body as stiff as a spear. He stood motionless, his eyes fixed on some unknown point.

"Don't go near him, look at him..." Ti Hu cautioned, grabbing Lan Yan's arm.

Ti Hu gazed intently at Han Li, noticing that something was off about him.

His face, which was never particularly striking, now had two conflicting expressions. The left half of his face was twisted in a scowl, his eyes wide with fear, his nose scrunched up, and his mouth curled into a malevolent grin. The right half of his face, on the other hand, looked more normal, but his eyes were filled with a struggling expression.

"Master, what's wrong with you?" Ti Hu exclaimed.

Han Li slowly raised his head, seemingly responding to Ti Hu's words. The right half of his face twitched, as if trying to speak, but the left half refused to cooperate, instead contorting into a grotesque smile.

"This time, it's really bad..." Lan Yan muttered, her expression grim.

Han Li let out a pained roar, his body lurching forward as if trying to charge towards Ti Hu and Lan Yan.

Lan Yan's eyes flashed with fear as she stumbled backward, trying to create some distance between herself and Han Li.

However, Han Li's movements suddenly stopped, and he clutched his head in agony, collapsing to the ground and rolling around wildly.

"What kind of technique did he use? Master's soul is becoming unstable!" Ti Hu exclaimed, sensing the turmoil in Han Li's soul.

"It's the Zhan Shi Xian Fu," Lan Yan replied gravely.

"Zhan Shi Xian Fu... what's that?" Ti Hu asked urgently.

"The Zhan Shi Xian Fu is one of the most precious heavenly symbols in the True Immortal Realm, a rare technique that can aid a Mahayana realm cultivator in slaying their corpse," Lan Yan explained.

"Slashing the corpse? Isn't that a bottleneck that only appears at the peak of the three stages of the Mahayana realm?" Ti Hu asked, perplexed.

"You're right, which is why this is the problem. Han Li is currently only at the early stage of the Mahayana realm, far from reaching the middle stage, and yet he was forced to use the Zhan Shi Xian Fu..."

Ti Hu's face turned even more grim as she realized the severity of the situation.

She knew Han Li's condition better than Lan Yan did. After breaking through to the Mahayana realm, Han Li had made rapid progress in his cultivation, but he was still far from reaching the peak of the early stage. He was nowhere near ready to face the bottleneck of slashing the corpse.

Normally, a Mahayana realm cultivator would prepare extensively before attempting to slash the corpse, finding a secluded location to meditate and cultivate. Even then, there was no guarantee of success, and the risk of backlash was high.

The Zhan Shi Xian Fu was an extreme measure, forcing Han Li to prematurely split his soul and create a corpse. Given his current state, he was doomed to fail, and the consequences would be catastrophic.

"Is there any way to stop it?" Ti Hu asked, her eyes fixed on Han Li.

"Gui Lingzi activated the Zhan Shi Xian Fu, and it's already in motion. We can't stop it... all we can do is hope that Han Li can suppress the symbol's effects," Lan Yan replied, her voice laced with despair.

Just then, Han Li's body suddenly stopped rolling, and he sprang to his feet, disappearing in an instant and reappearing in front of Ti Hu.

Ti Hu was caught off guard, only managing to cross her arms in a defensive gesture. Han Li's fingers transformed into claws, and he swiped at her with a ferocious roar.

Ti Hu glimpsed Han Li's face through the gap between her arms, and her eyes widened in horror. His face had contorted into a grotesque, evil visage, with a twisted grin and a mouthful of transparent saliva.

"Hehe, you seem to be connected to him quite closely..." Han Li sneered.

In the next instant, Ti Hu felt a massive force assault her, her arms trembling as if they were about to shatter. Her body was flung backward, crashing into the ruins and leaving a deep gash in the ground.

She finally came to a stop when she collided with a massive stone wall, her hand instinctively covering her mouth as she spat out a mouthful of blood.
