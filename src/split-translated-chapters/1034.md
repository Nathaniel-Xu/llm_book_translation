“Stone Brother, you just came out of seclusion, you don't know that the Golden Source Immortal Palace has encountered a great calamity. It's said that over a hundred years ago, someone single-handedly killed their way into the Golden Source Immortal Palace, slaughtering the palace master, Dongfang Bai, and his five Tian Yin disciples, as well as other powerful experts. The current Golden Source Immortal Palace's power has greatly decreased, and the Heavenly Court doesn't know why, but they still haven't sent anyone to take charge of the situation. So, they probably won't come this time.” The grey-haired old woman looked at the white-haired old man and slowly said.

“Such a thing has happened! Dongfang Bai was a peak existence in the Tai Yi realm, his true strength was almost equal to the Da Luo realm. Who could have done such a thing? Could it be the Wheel of Reincarnation Temple?" The white-haired old man's body shook, and his eyes revealed an expression of disbelief.

“According to rumors, it was done by someone named Han Li on the Extermination List. I don't know if this person is a member of the Wheel of Reincarnation Temple, but the Heavenly Court has never encountered such a... absurd thing. Now, the Heavenly Court has issued a pursuit order, offering a heavy reward for capturing this person, but there's been no news of him. I don't know if he's already left the Golden Source Immortal Domain.” The grey-haired old woman chuckled and said.

The white-haired old man nodded thoughtfully, his expression returning to calmness, but his eyes still flickered with a hint of excitement.

At this moment, near the group of people from the Huang Feng Gate, two figures stood nearby.

The two figures were both wearing black robes, the woman was a young girl with a beautiful face, and the man was slender with a slightly pale complexion.

After hearing the conversation between the Huang Feng Gate group, the two figures looked over, their expressions somewhat unusual.

“So many years have passed, and Han Li, you've given me more and more surprises.” The young girl's mouth curved upwards, and she whispered to herself in a barely audible voice.

“What's wrong, do you want to go find that person? Don't forget our mission.” The black-robed young man looked at the young girl, his brow furrowed as he transmitted his voice.

“You can rest assured, I know what's important.” The young girl waved her hand and said lightly.

At this moment, several majestic blue lights flew over from the distance, carrying an extremely dense water aura, and quickly arrived nearby.

As the lights flashed, four blue-robed cultivators appeared, directly descending towards the ground.

The four cultivators emitted extremely powerful auras, all of them being Tai Yi realm existences. The people in front hastily made way.

“They're from the Tian Shui Sect! I didn't expect them to come too.” The Huang Feng Gate's yellow-faced man's expression changed, and he whispered.

The Huang Feng Gate's other members also changed expressions, and the people nearby all did the same.

The Tian Shui Sect's four cultivators ignored the surrounding people, quickly arriving near the golden light pillar.

Two of the four cultivators walked in front, one was a twenty-one or twenty-two-year-old woman with beautiful features, her face cold and detached, as if she was a goddess from the moon palace, always emitting a feeling of rejection.

The other person was a middle-aged man with long, narrow eyes and a hooked nose, his entire body radiating a fierce aura, making people shiver.

The two cultivators behind were a sturdy, tall man with a dense brow, and a refined, elegant young man holding a folding fan, resembling a worldly, elegant gentleman.

The Ling Xiao Gate and other sects stood up, hastily making way to the side, clearing a space.

“Su Xianzi, Jing Liu Daoist, it's been many years since we parted ways at the Lake of Suspension. I didn't expect you two to come here too.” A broad-faced, large man from the Ling Xiao Gate walked out, smiling as he spoke to the cold-faced woman and the middle-aged man, but with a hint of probing.

“Are you saying this place is your Ling Xiao Gate's territory, and we can't come here?" Jing Liu glanced at the broad-faced man, his expression cold.

“I wouldn't dare, but the Tian Shui Sect is quite far from here, and you two are important figures within the Tian Shui Sect. Now, you've come here together, and we're all curious – do you know something about this anomaly?" The broad-faced man shook his head, his eyes flashing with a hint of inquiry.

The people from the Wang You Pavilion, Lie Guang City, and other forces also looked over.

Being stared at by so many people, Jing Liu's eyebrows furrowed.

“We were handling some matters near the Golden Source Mountain Range, and we heard about this anomaly, so we came to investigate. As for the situation here, we know nothing. But the Qing Su Valley is closest to this place, they should have some information.” Su Xianzi interrupted, her voice clear and cold, yet lively, and then looked at the group of blue-robed cultivators nearby.

“I, Qing Su Valley, although we're closest to this place, it's quite desolate, and people rarely come here. But I've already sent people to investigate, and this mountain valley is called Qing Si Gou. It's indeed strange, and within Qing Si Gou, there's a place called White Hair Valley. According to the nearby mortals, there's a clear spring in the valley, which can make old and dying people regain their youth. However, that clear spring is currently enveloped by the light pillar, and we can't investigate.” A blue-robed cultivator from the Qing Su Valley walked out, hastily explaining, as if afraid of being targeted.

“Making people regain their youth... that's quite unusual. Could it be related to the time laws? Is that clear spring the legendary Guang Yin water?" Su Xianzi's face showed a hint of surprise, and she guessed.

“Guang Yin water is extremely precious, how could it appear in such a remote place? Mortals are foolish, maybe that clear spring has nothing to do with this light pillar anomaly.” Jing Liu shook his head.

Su Xianzi glanced at Jing Liu, but didn't speak.

“Haha! Fellow cultivators, you've arrived quickly, but I, Lei, have come too late.” A loud voice suddenly echoed through the mountain valley, reverberating through the air.
Everyone heard the sound, and their expressions changed as they looked up.

Jin Liu's eyebrows furrowed as he gazed into the distance.

Su Zhang's face turned cold, and her entire body suddenly radiated a chill, icy aura.

A golden light appeared on the horizon, and in the next moment, it rapidly expanded and brightened, transforming into a golden sun-like light that illuminated the valley, making it impossible for anyone to open their eyes.

"Lei Yu Ce, you're quite bold," Jin Liu sneered, waving his sleeve.

A layer of blue light, like a wave, shot out from his hand and rapidly spread out.

Wherever it passed, the dazzling blue light seemed to be absorbed, disappearing from sight.

"Ah, Fellow Daoist Jin's 'Cang Hai Shen Jue' is even more exquisite, I must admit," a voice said as the golden light flashed and disappeared, revealing two figures descending from the sky.

The first person was a sturdy man in his thirties, wearing a golden robe, with a robust physique and visible muscle lines, like a majestic lion.

The other person was a handsome young man with a gentle, ethereal aura, and a calm demeanor.

"Originally, it was Fellow Daoist Lei and Fellow Daoist Wen from the Tong Tian Sword Sect, I didn't expect you two to be here as well, what a fortunate encounter," the burly man from the Ling Xiao Sect and the green-robed man from the Qing Su Valley said, greeting them with even more respect than they had shown the Tian Shui Sect's four cultivators.

"We two were also handling matters in the Jin Yuan Mountain Range, and we happened to hear about the events here, so we came to take a look. The treasure within the secret realm is naturally meant for those with the right fate, our Tong Tian Sword Sect doesn't intend to monopolize it, so please don't worry," the handsome young man said with a smile.

"We're willing to follow Fellow Daoist Lei and Fellow Daoist Wen," the burly man and the others said, relieved.

The four Tian Shui Sect cultivators looked on, their expressions not very pleasant, but they didn't say much.

"Su Xianzi, it's been many years since we last met, you've been closed off, cultivating the 'Tai Yin Bing Po Dao', I've visited you many times, but never managed to see you, I didn't expect to run into you here today. It seems you've broken through the bottleneck of the Tai Yi Later Period, I'm truly happy for you," Lei Yu Ce said, ignoring the others and gazing at Su Zhang with a deep, affectionate look in his eyes.

Su Zhang snorted, turning her head away, her expression annoyed.

Lei Yu Ce didn't seem to mind, continuing to gaze at Su Zhang with a lovesick expression.

The surrounding crowd didn't react with surprise, as if they were accustomed to this scene.

The Tong Tian Sword Sect's Lei Yu Ce had been pursuing the Tian Shui Sect's Su Zhang for tens of thousands of years, and this was a well-known fact throughout the Jin Yuan Continent.

"These two are quite strong, what is the Tong Tian Sword Sect?" a young girl from the Huang Feng Sect asked, her brow furrowed, in a whispered transmission.

"The Tong Tian Sword Sect is considered the number one sect in the Jin Yuan Xian Domain, its strength is comparable to the Jin Yuan Xian Palace, and this Lei Yu Ce is the Tong Tian Sword Sect's Vice-Sect Leader, his strength has reached the Tai Yi Later Period, making him one of the top experts in the Jin Yuan Xian Domain. As for the handsome young man, his surname is Wen, and he's probably the Tong Tian Sword Sect's Sword-Bearing Elder, Wen Zhong, his strength is also not to be underestimated. These two, along with the Tian Shui Sect's Su Zhang and Jin Liu, are the main enemies we'll be facing on this journey. Didn't you read the documents before we set out? I'm starting to doubt whether it's suitable for you to be in charge of this matter," a black-robed youth said, his brow furrowed, in a whispered transmission.

"You're getting things backwards, they're just a few local tyrants in the Jin Yuan Xian Domain, they're not that powerful, our true enemies are them," the young girl said, her eyes glinting, as she nodded towards the distance.

The black-robed youth looked over, and saw two blue-green lights flying towards the valley.

These two lights weren't very bright, and the valley was filled with lights, so they didn't stand out.

The blue-green lights quickly arrived, and transformed into a male and female cultivator, the man with a thick beard, and the woman with a round face and a cherry blossom mouth, both of them looked ordinary, the kind of people who would blend into the crowd.

"Who are they?" the black-robed youth asked, his expression puzzled.

The young girl flipped her hand, and a white pearl the size of a chicken egg appeared in her palm, with a ring of white light flashing within.

The light flashed, and the images of the two cultivators appeared, but their faces had changed to new ones.

The man was in his thirties, with a white face and a short beard, giving off a scholarly aura, while the woman was only seventeen or eighteen, with a pale, oval face, and a lively, mischievous expression, with big, round eyes that seemed to be constantly moving.

"Are they the Blue siblings from the Jin Han Xian Palace, Blue Yuan and Blue Yan? How did they end up here? Has our presence been discovered?" the black-robed youth's eyes widened in surprise.
