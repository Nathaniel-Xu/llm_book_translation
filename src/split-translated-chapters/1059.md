Hehe, who knows, our arrival here is a blessing or a curse!" Jin Liu said with a self-deprecating smile.

"Whether it's good or bad, this place seems to have a stronger suppressive force on one's spiritual sense as we ascend, making it quite uncomfortable." Fu Gu Zhu said with a furrowed brow.

"Let's go. We can't turn back now, since we've arrived, let's explore the tower together and see what's at the top, it's not a waste of a trip." Su Xian Ci said calmly.

With that, she led the way forward, Jin Liu followed closely behind, his eyes slightly sunken.

Fu Gu Zhu and the others looked at each other with complex expressions, gazing at the massive stone gate behind them, seemingly still hesitant.

"The seal on this stone gate is no weaker than a large sect's protective array, breaking it won't be easy, let's find another way out." Han Li said as he walked past Fu Gu Zhu, reminding him.

As he spoke, he also hurried towards the black building.

Fu Gu Zhu and the others saw this and changed their expressions, hesitating for a moment before following him.

As they walked, the air grew thick with an eerie, malevolent energy, and the temperature dropped, causing the noses and mouths of the Golden Immortal cultivators to emit wisps of white mist.

When they arrived at the black building, they found it was an ancient, overgrown temple.

The temple's entrance was in disrepair, with weeds growing in the cracks between the bricks, and the wooden doors were covered in moss, with rusty door rings hanging crookedly.

Han Li stood outside the entrance, gazing up at the sign above the door, murmuring, "Eighteen Layers..."

The others looked at the sign and their faces turned strange.

"How can it be eighteen layers? We just entered the third layer, how did we get here?" Fu Gu Zhu asked in surprise.

"Don't be alarmed, perhaps it's just the name of the temple, 'Eighteen Layers'." Jin Liu said dismissively.

"This place is eerie and foreboding, I think we shouldn't go in." A Golden Immortal cultivator said fearfully.

Just then, the creaking sound of the temple doors opening echoed through the air, and the doors swung open by themselves.

The group waited for a moment, seeing no movement inside, they looked at each other in confusion.

Jin Liu and Su Xian Ci exchanged a glance, nodded, and led the way inside.

Han Li raised an eyebrow, feeling a sense of curiosity, and followed them in.

Fu Gu Zhu and the others hesitated, but eventually followed, their hearts heavy with foreboding.

As they entered the temple, the doors creaked shut behind them, and two green ghostly flames emerged from the darkness, floating before them like lanterns, guiding them deeper into the temple.

The group was shocked by this eerie scene, and after a moment of hesitation, they followed the ghostly flames, venturing deeper into the temple.

Beyond the entrance lay a small, white plaza, which Han Li found was not paved with white stone, but rather with broken, white bones, the ground uneven and emitting faint, creaking sounds.

As they walked, the group arrived at the Heavenly King's Hall.

 Inside, two massive, dozens of feet tall statues of the Heavenly Kings stood, their faces twisted into malevolent grins, their hands grasping a demonic mallet and a bloody human head.

The group passed through the hall and entered a larger plaza, where nine high platforms stood on either side, with figures looming in the shadows, and the sound of mournful wails echoed through the air.

Han Li's brow furrowed as he gazed up at the first platform, where a green-skinned demon was using a black iron pincer to extract the tongue of an elderly woman, her face contorted in agony.

On the opposite platform, a beautiful woman was bound to a stone bed, her body exposed, as two green-haired demons used giant scissors to cut at her flesh, her cries echoing through the air.

Han Li's gaze swept across the platforms, each one displaying a different, gruesome scene.

On one platform, a massive stone mill was being pushed by a powerful demon, grinding human limbs and bones, the victim's head still intact, screaming in agony.
In another place, a giant iron cauldron was set up, with flames swirling beneath it, and boiling oil inside. Several evil spirits were seen carrying a terrified person, who was about to be thrown into the cauldron, causing a massive explosion of black smoke and a foul stench.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed tightly as he finally understood why this place was called the "Eighteen Layers".

In the mortal realm and the spiritual realm, there were rumors that the Underworld had eighteen layers of purgatory. Han Li had heard many stories about it since he was young, so seeing this scene before him didn't feel strange, but rather more puzzling.

"What kind of place is this?" Fu Gu Zhu asked with a serious expression, his voice loud and questioning.

As soon as his words fell, a red light appeared in the high sky in front of the square, and ten figures slowly descended from the air.

Han Li took a closer look and saw that they were ten ghostly figures wearing crimson official robes, with golden jade belts around their waists. Those ghostly figures were born with different features, some with cow heads, some with horse faces, and some with monkey-like features... each one was terrifying and strange, without any human form, except for one who had a pale face and no beard, with a red flower on his chest, looking like a scholar who had just passed the imperial examination.

"You dare to pretend to be gods and demons, and deceive people with your tricks?" Jing Liu's eyes turned cold, and he shouted angrily.

"You dare to not kneel down and confess your crimes when you see the Ten Judges of the Underworld?" The pale-faced man with the red flower on his chest pointed at the crowd, scolding.

His voice was sharp and thin, and with his somewhat feminine movements, he broke the image of a scholar, looking more like a eunuch.

"Ten lowly ghost generals dare to call themselves the Judges of the Underworld? Laughable!" Su Zhen Cai sneered, saying.

"Today, you have entered the Eighteen Layers of Purgatory, and you will be sentenced to the punishment of no reincarnation. Do not think of escaping!" The pale-faced ghost general shouted, flying up into the air.

The other nine ghost generals followed him, their crimson robes fluttering without wind, making a loud "whooshing" sound.

As they rose into the air, the surrounding area was filled with wailing winds, and a large amount of dark mist burst forth from the ground, with countless evil spirits wielding white bone swords, rushing towards the center of the square.

Due to the sheer number of evil spirits, they were already crowded together, colliding with each other, trampling and pushing, their wailing and screaming voices shaking the heavens.

"This... how can there be so many ghostly creatures?" Fu Gu Zhu frowned.

"They are just ordinary yin creatures, and can be easily defeated. Do not panic, and do not disrupt the formation. First, let us clear away these miscellaneous soldiers, and then we will deal with the ten ghost generals above." Jing Liu's expression remained calm, and he said loudly.

As he spoke, he waved his hand, and a Linglong Pagoda appeared in the air, emitting a silver light.

Han Li took a closer look and saw that the pagoda was surrounded by a spatial aura, and he thought to himself:

"A spatial treasure... it's not bad, but the quality is not high."

Just then, the doors of the pagoda opened, and over a dozen figures flew out, their bodies rotating as they landed, and they turned out to be over a dozen elders of the Tian Shui Sect.

Among them was the leader, a Tai Yi initial-stage cultivator, and the rest were mostly Golden Immortal late-stage and Golden Immortal peak-stage cultivators.

"Ru Qiu Elder, there are many ghost generals here, and we need your help." Jing Liu bowed to the group, saying.

"No need to be polite, we volunteered to enter the Shedding Body Pagoda, in order to assist you at the critical moment, so there is no need to be polite." The leader, a white-haired and thin elder, waved his hand, saying.

Fu Gu Zhu and the others saw this, and their hearts slightly calmed down. They held their magical tools, preparing to defend themselves.

After that, Jing Liu and Su Zhen Cai exchanged a glance, and led the dozen Tian Shui Sect elders to fly up and attack the ghost generals who claimed to be the Ten Judges of the Underworld.

"Friends, these yin creatures are not powerful, but there are too many of them. If we split up and fight, we will eventually exhaust ourselves. Why don't we work together to set up the Qinglong Hunyuan Formation, and perhaps we can hold on until the Tian Shui Sect wins?" Fu Gu Zhu said, his expression serious.

"This Qinglong Hunyuan Formation is a secret array of the Qing Su Valley, and we are not familiar with it, so how can we set it up together?" A Golden Immortal loose cultivator looked worried, asking.

"The key to setting up this formation is a treasure, and you only need to follow my instructions to do it. The formation is very simple." Fu Gu Zhu said, and then quickly transmitted the method of setting up the Qinglong Hunyuan Formation to the group through voice transmission.

Immediately after, he raised his hand, and a dragon-shaped jade pendant flew out, saying:

"Set up the formation!"

As soon as his words fell, the group immediately acted, following his instructions to set up the formation. They surrounded a circle, stepped on the footwork, and chanted incantations.

Han Li, however, did not move, standing still beside the group.

As the evil spirits rushed towards them like a tide, the group did not have time to care about him, but they all had a bit of resentment in their hearts.

The group continued to set up the formation, and the sound of their incantations grew louder.
