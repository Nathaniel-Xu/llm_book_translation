The mountain range that appeared before Han Li and the others was vast and undulating, with numerous towering peaks that pierced the clouds. However, the surrounding spiritual energy was not particularly dense, and as a result, there were not many fierce beasts or demonic creatures. The area seemed somewhat barren and lacking in vitality.

Places like this, with nothing of value to be found, were naturally not often visited by cultivators.

As soon as Huo Yan entered the mountain range, he seemed to relax greatly, occasionally breaking into a loud and cheerful poem, or pointing out some interesting sights to Han Li and the others.

Han Li was initially uninterested, but seeing Nan Gong Wan listening intently and occasionally interjecting with her own discoveries, Huo Yan was overjoyed.

Han Li then focused his attention on Huo Yan's current state, and found that it was quite pleasant. He occasionally offered his own insights, which, due to their different perspectives, sparked a discussion between Huo Yan and Nan Gong Wan.

The three of them chatted and laughed as they wandered through the mountains, eventually stopping at a secluded peak.

In reality, Han Li had sensed that this peak was unusual even from a distance.

It wasn't that the peak was vastly different from the surrounding mountains, but rather that it was protected by a series of ingenious restrictions. It was likely that cultivators below the Taiyi realm would not be able to discover them, let alone break through.

Huo Yan produced a white token and lightly waved it, releasing a beam of white light that vanished into the void at the foot of the mountain.

The void rippled slightly, and a white fissure appeared, revealing a hazy white interior that was impossible to discern.

"Please, follow me," Huo Yan said, leading the two into the white fissure.

Han Li felt the scenery around him change dramatically, and suddenly found himself in a secluded and picturesque valley.

The valley was home to several elegant bamboo buildings, surrounded by a bamboo forest and a clear stream that flowed into a pond. The atmosphere was serene and peaceful, with numerous immortal birds and beasts living in the forest and by the stream.

On the other side of the valley, there were several fields and gardens filled with rare and exotic flowers. Two figures were busy tending to the plants.

"Ah!"

As Han Li and the others approached, the two figures looked up and began to walk towards them.

One of them was Yun Ni, and the other was a stunningly beautiful girl.

Han Li was familiar with the girl, who was none other than Bai Su Xian.

It had been many years since they last met, and Yun Ni and Bai Su Xian had both made significant progress in their cultivation. Yun Ni had reached the late stage of the Golden Immortal realm, while Bai Su Xian had actually reached the Golden Immortal realm as well, with an aura that was both mysterious and impressive.

"I wondered who it could be," Yun Ni said with a smile, approaching Han Li. "For years, I've been expecting your return, and every time I drink wine, I think of you."

"Yun Ni, it's been a long time," Han Li replied, bowing slightly.

"Senior Li, I've never forgotten the great kindness you showed me when you took me to the Zhu Long Dao," Bai Su Xian said, her eyes shining with gratitude. "Please accept my respects."

Han Li smiled and raised his hand, and Bai Su Xian's body was lifted by an invisible force, standing up without her noticing.

She was taken aback, and then glanced at Han Li twice, before smiling at Nan Gong Wan and seeming to wonder how she had managed to attach herself to Li Fei Yu.

Yun Ni's eyes, however, flashed with shock, as he realized that Han Li was able to lift a Golden Immortal with such ease, a feat that even a typical Taiyi realm cultivator could not accomplish.

Han Li then introduced Nan Gong Wan to Yun Ni and Bai Su Xian, and they exchanged greetings before entering one of the bamboo buildings.

The interior was spacious and elegantly decorated, with a view of the entire valley that was breathtakingly beautiful.

As they sat down, Han Li asked Huo Yan why they had chosen to live in this place.

Huo Yan sighed and began to explain. "We originally lived in a secluded area of the North Cold Immortal Domain, but a large group of gray immortals suddenly invaded, causing chaos in the immortal realm. Our home was affected, and we were forced to flee. Unfortunately, our friend Feng Yi was killed, and we had to go through a lot of trouble to eventually end up in the Black Soil Immortal Domain."

Yun Ni and Bai Su Xian's expressions turned somber as they listened to Huo Yan's words.

Han Li also sighed inwardly, thinking about the turmoil in the immortal realm. Many immortal domains had been affected, making the already treacherous path of cultivation even more difficult. Those with weak cultivation were often at risk of being killed, and their years of effort could be reduced to nothing.

As the official authority of the immortal realm, the Heavenly Court was still preparing for the so-called Bodhi Banquet, and the various immortal domains were also actively planning for the event. It seemed that they were not particularly concerned with the fate of smaller, less important domains.
Perhaps in the eyes of the great powers in the Da Luo Realm, and even some of the Dao Ancestors, the low-ranking cultivators in the True Immortal Realm are like ants, their lives and deaths are of no consequence.

"We arrived at the Hei Tu Xian Domain and heard that the Huan Yan Swamp was once the site of the True Speech Sect's ruins. After the Heavenly Court destroyed it thousands of years ago, the place was abandoned, and we decided to settle here. You can see that the environment is not bad, right?" Hu Yan Dao Ren continued.

"The winding path leads to a secluded valley, with mountain light and pond shadows, it's a true paradise on earth." Han Li nodded, looking back at Nan Gong Wan, who was also looking at him with a hint of expectation in her eyes, but it was fleeting.

Han Li sighed inwardly, quietly extending a hand to gently pat Nan Gong Wan's palm.

He knew that Nan Gong Wan had endured hardships to reach the True Immortal Realm from the Ling Realm, and although she had the same desire for immortality, a large part of her reason was to be with him.

Nan Gong Wan didn't say it out loud, but Han Li, as someone who had gone through similar experiences, knew that she had a deep-seated weariness.

Who would have thought that after cultivating in the mortal realm and the Ling Realm, and finally achieving true immortality, it was only the beginning of another, even more difficult and longer path?

Even more so, one that seemed endless...

But this woman had always been strong-willed and able to see the big picture, knowing that Han Li's current situation left him no choice but to move forward, and that he couldn't stay by her side for long.

During their recent travels, Han Li had felt Nan Gong Wan's deep affection for him, and her treasured moments with him.

Whenever he thought about it, he felt a warm sensation in his heart.

Nan Gong Wan seemed to sense the emotions in Han Li's eyes, and nodded slightly, her gaze filled with determination.

The two exchanged a glance, which lasted only a breath, but conveyed more than a thousand words.

Hu Yan Dao Ren then asked Han Li about his experiences over the years. Since they had been avoiding the world and living in seclusion, they hadn't seen the news about the Heavenly Court pursuing Han Li.

Han Li didn't want to involve them in his affairs, so he only said that he had been cultivating in the Hei Shan Xian Domain, and didn't mention anything else. He said that he had come to the Huan Yan Swamp to explore the True Speech Sect's ruins.

"Hu Yan Dao Ren, you mentioned earlier that the Heavenly Court destroyed the True Speech Sect's ruins thousands of years ago. What exactly happened?" Han Li asked.

"Ah, it's a story I gathered from the nearby sects. Apparently, several groups of people came, including the Heavenly Court, and searched the True Speech Sect's ruins inside and out. They seemed to be looking for something. In the end, they destroyed the place, including the spirit vein." Bai Su Yuan spoke up, having been quietly listening until now.

"It's indeed typical of the Heavenly Court's actions... Let's not discuss this further. Hu Yan Dao Ren, why has your cultivation declined so much?" Han Li changed the subject, asking about Hu Yan Dao Ren's cultivation.

Yun Ni's expression changed, but she didn't speak.

Bai Su Yuan, who was sitting beside her, lowered her head.

"It's nothing. When I first arrived at the Hei Tu Xian Domain, I encountered an enemy who was evenly matched with me. We fought, and I injured him, but he also wounded me, which led to my cultivation decline." Hu Yan Dao Ren smiled, seemingly unconcerned about his cultivation decline.

"I see." Han Li nodded, knowing that Hu Yan Dao Ren's casual words hid some unspoken secrets, but he didn't press the issue.

"Let's not talk about this anymore. Let's focus on the main topic. Li, I've gathered some spiritual materials from the Hei Tu Xian Domain and brewed some good wine. Let's taste it together." Hu Yan Dao Ren stood up, smiling.

"Ah, Hu Yan, times have changed, and people have changed. Why do you still use the old nickname to address Li?" Yun Ni felt uneasy, seeing Hu Yan Dao Ren call Han Li "little Li", and quickly intervened.

"It's just a nickname, Li. If you can't see through it, you wouldn't have achieved your current level in such a short time." Hu Yan Dao Ren laughed.

"Ha ha, Hu Yan Dao Ren is right! Today, we're all old friends, and we should only talk about the wind and the moon, and drink to our hearts' content. Why bother with cultivation ranks?" Han Li laughed.

Yun Ni looked surprised, but quickly relaxed, a hint of a smile on her face. Bai Su Yuan's gaze shifted between Hu Yan Dao Ren and Han Li, her expression more relaxed, but her eyes showed even more respect for Han Li.

Hu Yan Dao Ren then invited Yun Ni and Bai Su Yuan to accompany Nan Gong Wan to explore the valley, while he took Han Li to a secluded area with a small pavilion.

The pavilion looked unassuming, but inside, it was filled with an astonishing array of wine jugs, wine jars, and wine cups, even more impressive than before.

Hu Yan Dao Ren became like a different person, enthusiastically introducing Han Li to his latest wine collection, and the various wine-making techniques he had learned.

For Han Li, it was as if the Hu Yan Dao Ren of old had returned, the one who wielded his sword and laughed at the world, and who had a deep love for wine.

Han Li finally felt that the Hu Yan Dao Ren he had known was back, and he couldn't help but smile.
