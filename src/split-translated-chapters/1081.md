On the other side of the golden desert, a group of six people, including Lei Yu Ce, gathered in front of a red-brown stone archway that stood out among the dunes. The archway was adorned with a circle of dense, intricate symbols, seven or eight of which were emitting a soft, golden glow. Inside the archway, a dark red light screen was suspended, with nine dark golden chains crisscrossing it. The chains were also adorned with dense, fish-scale-like symbols that radiated a powerful restrictive force.

"If you look closely, you'll see that the nine dark golden chains have symbols like fish scales, which are emitting a powerful restrictive force," Lei Yu Ce said, his face serious.

Jin Liu looked at Lei Yu Ce with a hint of doubt in his eyes. "Lei Dao You, can you really break this Nine Dragon Lock Divine Array?"

Lei Yu Ce did not answer immediately, instead conferring with Wen Zhong in a low voice before responding. "This Nine Dragon Lock Divine Array has been modified, so breaking it won't be easy. It'll take some time."

"How much time will it take?" Su Qian asked, her brow furrowed.

"The array is complex, and modifying just one of the dragon scales makes the solution twice as complicated. At least four of the restrictions have been modified... it'll take at least two to three days to open it," Lei Yu Ce said, his expression thoughtful.

"Two to three days? That's too long!" Jin Liu exclaimed.

"If you have a better way to break the array, you're welcome to try," Wen Zhong said, his brow furrowed in annoyance.

Jin Liu's face fell, and a hint of anger flashed in his eyes, but he said nothing.

In terms of breaking the array, his talent was actually quite average. Otherwise, he wouldn't have mistaken the Xing Gong's Confrontation Array for a Yin-Yang Closure Array earlier. Now, he couldn't break the Nine Dragon Lock Divine Array.

Lan Yuanzi and his sister exchanged a glance, shaking their heads. Neither of them knew the solution to the array, so they said nothing.

Lei Yu Ce looked at Jin Liu, then at Su Qian, his expression softening slightly. "I have another method, but I'm not sure if it will work. We can try it, but I don't have much confidence in it."

"Since we have a method, we should try it. Otherwise, we'll be stuck here for who knows how long," Jin Liu said, his brow furrowed.

"You're making it sound easy, but the method Lei Shixiong is talking about is a forced break, which could harm himself. It's not something to be taken lightly," Wen Zhong said, his anger rising.

Su Qian's eyes flickered with a hint of change as she looked at Lei Yu Ce. "It seems we can only wait...," Jin Liu said, stroking his chin.

"Lei Dao You, if the risk is too great, it's better to wait a few more days," Su Qian said, turning to Lei Yu Ce.

"Su Xianzi, don't worry, I'll try it," Lei Yu Ce said, his voice firm.

Wen Zhong's eyes flashed with a hint of resignation, and he opened his mouth to dissuade Lei Yu Ce, but then closed it again.

"To break the array quickly, we need to use an array to counter an array. We'll use the Wild Array to forcibly open the Nine Dragon Lock Divine Array and create a temporary path," Lei Yu Ce said, his eyes gleaming with determination.

"The Wild Array is something I'm familiar with, but it's far inferior to the Nine Dragon Lock Divine Array. How can it possibly break the array and create a stable path?" Jin Liu asked, his brow furrowed.

"Of course, the Wild Array alone is not enough. Later, I'll use the Nine Dragon Pearl as the array's core to start the array. Once the array is activated, I'll need everyone's help," Lei Yu Ce said, his eyes locked on Jin Liu.

"The Nine Dragon Pearl? If we have that treasure, we might have a chance to break the array," Jin Liu said, nodding.

"We'll do our best to help," Lan Yuanzi said, clasping his hands together.

Su Qian didn't say anything, just nodding slightly.

Lei Yu Ce took out a set of array flags and stones, beginning to set up the Wild Array outside the stone archway. Wen Zhong assisted him, and soon the array's outline was visible.

After that, they buried the array stones in the ground and inserted the array flags, completing the Wild Array.

"Everyone, the array is set up. Please enter the array to help," Lei Yu Ce said, inspecting the array one last time.

As soon as he finished speaking, the group entered the array, standing at the six corners of the hexagonal array. They formed hand seals, waiting for Lei Yu Ce to activate the array.

Lei Yu Ce stood at the corner closest to the stone archway, looking at Su Qian beside him before nodding.

Then, his wrist moved, and a purple sphere the size of a fist flew out of thin air, spinning and falling towards the center of the Wild Array.

The sphere was surrounded by electrical threads, with nine dragon-shaped patterns moving on its surface. A low, rumbling sound emanated from it.

As the Nine Dragon Pearl took its place, Lei Yu Ce's eyes narrowed, and his voice began to chant.
Everyone saw the situation and began to recite their incantations, their hands weaving intricate patterns as they pointed at the purple orb.

The six paths of colorful spiritual energy shot out from their fingertips and converged on the purple orb, producing a low humming noise.

Suddenly, the Nine Dragon Pearl emitted a burst of electric light, and countless purple lightning threads erupted from it, forming a purple glow that filled the entire array.

A dragon's roar echoed through the air as the nine dragon shadows on the pearl shot out, dancing within the purple lightning glow before transforming into nine massive purple lightning dragons that charged towards the circular archway.

A deafening boom shook the air as the dragons crashed into the archway, causing the dark red glow within to violently tremble.

The crowd's hearts were racing as they poured their spiritual energy into the array.

A hissing sound filled the air as the dark red glow began to take shape, forming a hole the size of a human head that revealed a glimpse of the space beyond.

"It's open! Add more force!" Jing Liu exclaimed, urging the others on.

"This is only a partial opening of the transmission gate; the Nine Dragon Lock Divine Seal Array has not been broken, do not be careless..." Lei Yu Ce warned, his voice laced with caution.

As he spoke, the nine dark gold dragon scales binding the dark red glow suddenly flared with golden light, emitting a wave of dragon-scale-like golden energy that obscured the entire array.

The golden light mixed with the purple lightning, producing a chaotic vortex that tore at the surrounding spiritual energy, drawing it towards the newly formed hole.

The hole's center was now a deep, black void, and the only visible feature was a faint, turbulent aura emanating from within.

Lei Yu Ce and the others, still within the array, could feel the terrifying power emanating from the void and exchanged nervous glances.

"It seems we underestimated the Nine Dragon Lock Divine Seal Array's power; let us withdraw our spiritual energy and retreat while the array's power has not been fully activated," Lei Yu Ce shouted.

His words had barely left his lips when a sudden, deafening boom shook the air, and the black vortex at the center of the archway erupted with a massive, chaotic energy that threatened to engulf everything.

The nine dark gold dragon scales binding the archway flashed with golden light, and nine golden dragon silhouettes burst forth, charging towards the crowd with jaws agape.

The group was caught off guard, and Jing Liu was the first to flee, followed closely by the Lan siblings.

As they retreated, the entire array collapsed, and the Nine Dragon Pearl lost control, its surface flashing with a black electrical glow before exploding in a blast of light.

Wen Zhong saw the situation and retreated, leaving only Lei Yu Ce and Su Qi, who were trapped between the golden dragon silhouettes and the purple lightning.

Their reactions were swift, but they were too close to the archway, and they had no time to react.

"Su Xianzi..."

Lei Yu Ce called out, his voice barely audible as he positioned himself in front of Su Qi, his body glowing with a faint, silver light.

A deafening boom shook the air as the golden light and purple lightning exploded, sending the group flying back.

Jing Liu and the others watched in horror as the explosion raged on, the golden light and purple lightning mixing in a chaotic dance that seemed to shake the very foundations of the earth.

The explosion finally subsided, leaving behind a massive, smoldering crater, and the surrounding landscape was scorched and blackened.

The group flew towards the crater, peering into its depths, and saw a massive, charred figure shielding a smaller, unscathed figure.

The figure was Lei Yu Ce, his silver armor shattered and his clothes torn and blackened. His back was heaving violently, and his aura was unstable, as if he had suffered a grievous injury.

Su Qi, however, was unscathed, her clothes only slightly damaged.

Lei Yu Ce's eyes were fixed intently on Su Qi, his expression a mixture of concern and relief.
