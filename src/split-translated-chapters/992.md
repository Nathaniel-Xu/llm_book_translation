Boom!

The void in front of him cracked open, and countless crystal lights surged out from it, condensing into a crystal wall with countless scenes flashing rapidly on it.

With a "chila" sound, the light on the crystal wall suddenly burst out, revealing a huge vortex that rotated endlessly, emitting a tremendous suction force that enveloped Han Li's body.

Han Li's expression remained unchanged, and he did not dodge. He allowed the suction force to pull his body.

However, at this moment, the golden light sphere in his dantian suddenly flickered and went out. The fairy spiritual power within his body came to an abrupt halt, and the suction force emitted by the vortex also greatly decreased. Han Li's body, which had been pulled up, stagnated in midair and then fell back to the ground with a "plop" sound.

However, a pain shot through his mind, and his divine soul was helplessly sucked into the vortex. His vision went black, and he lost consciousness.

When Han Li regained consciousness, he found himself by the side of a vast river in a wilderness.

In the river, countless water droplet-like light spheres were still suspended, flowing forward with a rumbling sound, looking no different from before.

At this moment, Han Li was in his divine soul form, hovering by the side of the river.

"Back in this place again, I wonder what this place really is?" Han Li looked around and murmured to himself.

His thoughts turned, and instead of approaching the river and entering one of the light spheres, he went upstream along the river, wanting to explore this place thoroughly.

He was now in a divine soul state, like a white cloud drifting in the air, moving with the wind, not very fast.

The desert scenery remained unchanged, and no matter where he went, it felt the same. There was no alternation between day and night here, and the flow of time was very vague.

Han Li continued forward, estimating that he had walked for about seven or eight days, but the river beside him showed no change at all.

Gradually losing patience, he endured for another two days, but the river beside him still showed no change.

"Forget it, I don't know how far this place is, or maybe there's some kind of illusion or prohibition here, so continuing on is probably a waste of time." Han Li stopped, pondered for a moment, and looked towards the river, about to leave.

At this moment, a yellow light flashed above his head, and a yellow cloud several feet in size appeared, with two black eyes the size of beans in the cloud, looking at Han Li.

"You are the Bottle Spirit!" Han Li was startled when he saw the yellow cloud appear, and then immediately recognized the true form of the yellow cloud.

The black eyes in the yellow cloud blinked twice, as if observing him.

"I wonder why you have appeared at this moment, what is the matter?" Han Li frowned slightly and asked again.

As soon as he finished speaking, the yellow cloud suddenly lit up, and a yellow crystal light shot out from it, entering his divine soul at an extremely fast speed.

Han Li's divine soul had no time to dodge, and the yellow crystal light had already entered his body, turning into a warm current and fusing into his divine soul.

He was greatly shocked and was about to question, but the Bottle Spirit's yellow cloud above his head disappeared again in a flash.

Han Li stood there in a daze for a moment, then carefully examined the situation inside his divine soul, but found nothing unusual and no discomfort.

He was silent for a moment, temporarily putting the matter aside, and came to the side of the river, looking at the countless shuttling light spheres in the river.

After so many transits, he had a general guess about the origin of the light spheres in the river.

Each of these light spheres represented a time node in the past, and entering one would take him back to that moment in the past.

Han Li's face showed a pensive look, and his eyes flickered.

The ability of the Mastery Sky Bottle to traverse time was unheard of, and if it could be completely mastered, the benefits would be immeasurable.

Not to mention anything else, with this ability, it would be much easier to investigate past events.

However, there were really too many light spheres in the river, and there seemed to be no pattern, making it somewhat chaotic. As for traversing to a specific time, one could only rely on luck.

Han Li sighed and secretly thought that it would be great if he could control the time nodes of the transit. At this moment, he wanted to investigate whether what the Crab Daoist had just said was true or false.

After the Crab Daoist merged with the sacred corpse this time, his cultivation soared, reaching the realm of Dao Ancestor. However, a rift had developed between the two, and they were no longer as close as before.

What the Crab Daoist had just said seemed logical and without flaws.

However, Han Li always felt that there seemed to be something hidden.

At this moment, a sudden change occurred.

The light spheres in the river suddenly fluctuated violently, as if a wave had suddenly risen.

Then, swish swish swish -!

More than a dozen light spheres of varying sizes flew out from various parts of the river and stopped in the river near Han Li, no longer flowing forward.

Han Li's face showed a surprised look, and he carefully examined those light spheres.

As with the previous light spheres, various scenes appeared on them, but this time the scenes on the light spheres were similar, all showing a beautiful palace.

"This palace looks somewhat familiar." Han Li murmured, took a couple of glances, and immediately realized.

The palace on the light spheres was the group of buildings near the Thousand Machine Hall. From the scenes on these light spheres, a fierce battle was taking place in various parts of the palace.

Han Li was greatly surprised. After pondering for a moment, his gaze fell on the largest light sphere, and he took two steps closer.

The light sphere suddenly released a tremendous swallowing force, and with a "swish" sound, it sucked Han Li's divine soul in.
Han Li's vision went dark, and he lost consciousness once again.

...

Unknown how much time had passed, Han Li slowly regained consciousness. He discovered that he had possessed the body of a young man wearing black armor, lying in a half-collapsed palace, with a gaping hole in his lower abdomen where the dantian should be, blood gushing out.

A semi-transparent golden wheel hovered above his head, with more than a thousand temporal runes flickering on it.

Continuous loud noises came from nearby, indicating an intense battle was taking place.

Han Li's heart stirred, but he did not immediately control the man in golden robes to stand up. Instead, he used his spiritual sense to communicate with the man's remaining memories.

Suddenly, a vast amount of memories flooded into Han Li's mind, and he hurriedly digested them. It took a while before he completely absorbed the information.

This man in golden robes was named Wu Xuan, a prisoner who was imprisoned in Jilin Empty Realm. Later, he was taken in by Shi Kong Jie, also known as Crab Daoist, and served as Crab Daoist's personal guard due to his considerable strength.

Over a hundred years ago, Crab Daoist began closed-door cultivation, attempting to cut off the last corpse to take the crucial final step. The entire Jilin Empty Realm was on high alert.

Unexpectedly, a large group of enemies suddenly attacked today, directly targeting the Qianji Palace where Crab Daoist was cultivating.

Seeing Wu Xuan's memories, Han Li's eyes revealed a strange light.

Previously, by the riverbank, he had the idea of investigating the drastic changes that happened to Crab Daoist back then. Now that he arrived here, could it be that he could control the nodes of time?

The more Han Li thought about it, the more he felt it was not a coincidence. Although he didn't know why, he indeed gained the ability to control temporal nodes.

Perhaps it was due to the spirit in the bottle from before, or maybe it was for some other reason.

Regardless, this was the best thing that could happen to him.

Han Li quickly stood up and went to the collapsed entrance of the palace, looking outside.

In the sky outside, he could occasionally see puppets fighting each other, as well as some people with the ability to fly, engaging in fierce battles, creating earth-shaking noises.

Among the two sides in combat, one side wore black armor like Wu Xuan, while the other side wore purple-black battle armor.

Han Li was not unfamiliar with the purple-black battle armor; it was the guard armor of the Night Sun Dynasty.

These people from the Night Sun Dynasty had abnormally tall and large bodies, with dark green skin revealing dragon-shaped patterns. With their fangs exposed, they looked like ferocious ghosts.

Although there were not many of these people, they were extremely powerful, incredibly strong, and fast as lightning.

Although Jilin Empty Realm had more people, they were at a disadvantage.

"Those are the Nightmare Dragon Guards. It seems that back then, it was indeed Shi Kong Yu who attacked." Han Li thought to himself.

When he chatted with Shi Chuan Kong, he had heard him mention the various secret legions of the Night Sun Dynasty, and they had discussed the Nightmare Dragon Guards many times. This was a legion composed purely of body cultivators, directly under the command of the Demon Master.

At this moment, it seemed that these Nightmare Dragon Guards were indeed extraordinary. Each one of them had the strength of an expert who had opened at least 150 mystic apertures.

After taking a couple of glances at the battle outside, Han Li's gaze shifted towards the distance.

From here, he could vaguely see four nine-story pagodas standing in the four corners of a white jade square.

And in the center of the square, there stood a majestic glazed palace - the Qianji Palace.

The closer to that place, the more intense the fighting became.

After a brief contemplation, Han Li pulled his armor to cover the wound on his lower abdomen. He then activated the "Ten Thousand Apertures Empty Silence Technique", and his figure shot out towards the Qianji Palace.

Using the nearby palaces as cover, he quickly approached the Qianji Palace.

At first, relying on the "Ten Thousand Apertures Empty Silence Technique", he went unnoticed. However, the closer he got to the Qianji Palace, the more intense the fighting became, and the more people there were. Eventually, he was discovered.

A Nightmare Dragon Guard holding a battle knife charged towards Han Li like lightning. The sound of exploding bones rang out from within his body like a string of firecrackers. The purple-black battle knife in his hand transformed into a dragon-shaped knife light, slashing towards Han Li's head.

Wu Xuan had only opened a little over a hundred mystic apertures, roughly equal to the strength of a Nightmare Dragon Guard. However, Han Li was now controlling this body, and his eyesight, knowledge, and judgment were naturally vastly different.

His body swayed left and right, transforming into nine shadows, instantly dodging the knife slash. The nine shadows then converged into one behind the Nightmare Dragon Guard, and Wu Xuan's body emerged, continuing to shoot forward.

The Nightmare Dragon Guard was about to give chase but was blocked by other people from Jilin Empty Realm, forcing him to abandon the pursuit.

Seeing that his actions had been exposed, Han Li decided to let loose. He weaved left and right through the crowd of intense battles, squeezing every bit of strength from this body and pushing his movement technique to the limit. He never stopped, avoiding engaging with others, and quickly approached the Qianji Palace.

The battle here was even more intense, with people from both sides fighting together at the entrance of the palace.

"That is..." Han Li hid behind a nearby wall of ruins, looking towards the entrance of the palace.

The leader of the Jilin Empty Realm faction was none other than Sha Xin. She was controlling five puppets, fighting fiercely with a person wearing cyan-colored battle armor.

That person was none other than E Chu.

His entire body's mystic apertures were flashing with light, approximately six to seven hundred. In his hand, he held the Barbaric Dragon Sword.

The appearances of the two had not changed much, but their temperament was distinct and sharp, lacking the smoothness they would develop later.

"E Chu, you actually colluded with Shi Kong Yu to harm our master. You deserve to die ten thousand deaths!" Sha Xin shouted angrily.

"Those who understand the times are brilliant. Shi Kong Jie will undoubtedly die today. Sha Xin, considering our past friendship, I advise you to surrender to the Holy Emperor. With your strength, the Holy Emperor will surely make good use of you." E Chu said with a smile.

"Dream on!" Sha Xin snorted coldly, controlling the five puppets to launch a massive attack.
