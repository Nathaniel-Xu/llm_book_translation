Lu Chuanfeng couldn't help but focus his attention on the white light vortex in the hall, ignoring the other people present.

After a moment, the white light vortex finally began to weaken, slowing down until it dissipated into a burst of starlight, and Feng Tianxian Shi's body fell out of it.

Han Li restrained his curiosity and looked at Feng Tianxian Shi.

He saw that his water armor had already disappeared, and his clothes were torn and tattered, revealing deep wounds all over his body.

But what was even more serious was that several important acupoints on his body, including his dantian, had been torn open by the explosion of star power, and the residual energy was still invading his body, causing him immense pain.

"Ahh..."

Feng Tianxian Shi let out a suppressed scream, his anger and hatred reaching a boiling point.

He couldn't remember the last time he had suffered such a heavy injury, and the sudden betrayal by Tianxing Zun had brought him not only physical pain but also spiritual humiliation.

"I will hunt down all the cultivators of the Day and Night Alliance throughout the entire Xian domain," Feng Tianxian Shi said, his voice filled with hatred.

"Xian Shi, you should first tend to your wounds. Huo Shan has already gone to pursue Tianxing Zun, and we can discuss the matter of punishment after he is caught," Lu Chuanfeng said, his brow furrowed with concern.

The Day and Night Alliance was a powerful force, with a vast network of cultivators, and it was impossible to hunt down every single one of them.

"No matter what, I will make Tianxing Zun and the Day and Night Alliance pay a hundredfold price," Feng Tianxian Shi said, his hatred unabated.

As he spoke, he winced in pain again, his face twisted in agony. He glanced at the people from the twelve sects, feeling a sense of shame and humiliation.

The cultivators from the twelve sects didn't dare to look at him directly, exchanging nervous glances instead.

"This is a disaster... a simple ceremony has turned into this..." Zi Luoxian sighed, her face filled with worry.

"We can't stay here, something else might happen...," a white-haired elder said, his brow furrowed with concern.

"We can't just sit here and wait for death. We have to leave," someone else said in a low voice.

"Let's go, let's leave this place..."

Someone called out, and the group of cultivators began to stand up, preparing to leave the hall.

But just as they were about to depart, the short and stout elder, Yu Chang, stepped forward again, blocking their path.

"You can't leave. Our sect leader has given orders that you are not to leave the Jiu Yuan Ge without permission," Yu Chang said.

"Yu Chang, you said earlier that the Jiu Yuan Ge was the safest place, with the strongest restrictive formations. But now that the formations have been broken, this place is a danger zone. Do you still want to keep us here?" Zhou Xianyang asked, his voice loud and clear.

Yu Chang looked embarrassed, unsure of what to say.

"Yu Chang, you have the time to stop us, but why not go and calm down the situation in the sect instead? We just want to leave the Jiu Yuan Ge," Luo Yuanshan said.

"Fine, I'll let the sect elders escort you out. But if anyone tries to sneak away or cause trouble, they will be treated as rebels and killed," Yu Chang said, sighing.

The cultivators listened to his warning, their faces changing.

But they all wanted to leave the Jiu Yuan Ge as quickly as possible, so they nodded in agreement.

Yu Chang then called over several sect elders and ordered them to escort the cultivators from the twelve sects out of the hall in batches.

Han Li was thinking about how to find an opportunity to leave when he heard Zhou Xianyang's voice in his mind.

"Brother Han, our task is complete. We can leave now."

"I still have some business to attend to. I'm not leaving yet," Han Li replied.

"Brother Jiao told me that if you don't want to leave, you should give me the Bodhi command. I'll take care of getting what you want," Zhou Xianyang said.

Han Li didn't hesitate, taking out the command token from his sleeve and handing it to Zhou Xianyang.

In return, Zhou Xianyang handed Han Li a jade pendant.

"Brother Han, I'll take my leave. This place is not safe. Take care of yourself," Zhou Xianyang said.

And with that, he left the hall with the other cultivators from the twelve sects.

Han Li held the jade pendant, thinking for a long time, but still couldn't find a suitable opportunity to leave.

As he watched the batches of cultivators leave, the hall grew quieter, until only a dozen or so Hu Shan sect elders and Han Li remained.
These people will be led out of the Nine Yuan Pavilion by you, and none of them should be lost. The elder Yu glanced at Han Li and the others, instructing the last elder of the Nine Yuan Pavilion in the hall.

"Yes." The elder nodded and said.

Then, he led Han Li and the others to the entrance of the hall.

Han Li walked at the end of the group, and with a glance, he saw the Phoenix Heaven Immortal Envoy surrounded by a layer of pale blue light, with a semi-transparent blue crystal the size of a dragon's eye floating above his head, emitting intense water attribute law fluctuations.

Under the nourishment of these layers of water attribute law, the terrifying wounds on the Phoenix Heaven Immortal Envoy's body had almost completely healed, but his aura was still unstable, and the star power raging within him had not yet been cleared.

Just then, Han Li suddenly felt a strong sense of crisis, and a powerful sense of danger swept over him.

He couldn't care about pretending to be someone else, and the time law power in his body instantly activated, his figure blurring as he flashed from the end of the group to the front.

However, at the same time, the temperature in the surrounding air dropped rapidly, and an extremely cold force swept through the entire Nine Yuan Pavilion.

Han Li watched as the Lake Mountain Sect elder, who had just passed by him, was frozen into an ice crystal, and his own body was frozen in place at the moment he was about to step out of the hall.

In a daze, he even felt that the time within a thousand feet had been frozen.

"Bad..."

Han Li's heart cried out, and the cold sensation seeped into his bones, causing the "Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique" to stop working, and his body's immortal spirit power was completely frozen.

It was a strange feeling, as if his divine soul had been sealed by the Isolation Lock Chain, and Han Li's immortal spirit power couldn't be mobilized at all, and no techniques could be used.

Fortunately, he had already attained great success in his cultivation, and his physical body had long since surpassed its former state, so he quickly activated the "Heavenly Extermination Prison Technique", mobilizing the star power within him.

As the technique activated, his body's acupuncture points lit up, and under the ice crystal, a white light appeared, constantly colliding with the blue ice crystal that surrounded him.

However, under the star power's impact, the blue ice crystal didn't show any signs of shattering, and instead, the intense cold force it emitted grew stronger, constantly invading his five organs and six viscera.

Han Li could clearly feel his heart slowing down, and his heartbeat becoming slower, so he quickly mobilized his spiritual energy, summoning the Spirit Flame Fire Bird to protect his heart.

At the same time, the entire Nine Yuan Pavilion was sealed in ice, with a pale blue mist spreading everywhere, and human-shaped ice sculptures stood motionless, looking both exquisite and strange.

The Phoenix Heaven Immortal Envoy was naturally not affected by the ice seal, and he had also sensed the sudden change, so he opened his eyes, looking at the Gold Source Heaven Palace's palace master, Lu Chuanfeng, with a puzzled expression.

"Palace Master Lu, what are you doing? Why have you released your Extreme Cold Spirit Domain?" he asked, furrowing his brow.

"The Immortal Envoy doesn't need to be alarmed, there's a little mouse from the Wheel of Rebirth Hall in the Nine Yuan Pavilion, and once I capture him, I'll lift the Spirit Domain." Lu Chuanfeng's gaze fell on Han Li, and he smiled.

Han Li noticed his gaze, and his heart skipped a beat, realizing that he was the target.

However, amidst his fear, he was also very puzzled, as he had been wearing a mask and hadn't shown any signs of being out of line, so how did Lu Chuanfeng discover his true identity?

Han Li was using all his strength to activate the Heavenly Extermination Prison Technique, trying to break through the ice crystal's seal, while also using the Spirit Flame Fire Bird to resist the intense cold force that was invading his body.

At the same time, he was constantly using his divine sense to connect with the Bottle Spirit of the Heavenly Bottle, and if he was in a desperate situation, he could use the bottle to perform a physical transmigration, allowing him to escape the danger.

But this would mean that he would have to leave the Nine Yuan Pavilion, and rescuing the Gold Child would become even more impossible.

"Is there someone from the Wheel of Rebirth Hall among these people?" the Phoenix Heaven Immortal Envoy asked in surprise.

"I wasn't sure at first, but when I released the Spirit Domain just now, this person used the Time Technique 'Great Five Elements Phantom World Technique' from the True Speech Sect, which confirmed that he is indeed a thief from the Wheel of Rebirth Hall." Lu Chuanfeng smiled.

"I'd like to take a look, which one is the thief from the Wheel of Rebirth Hall?" The Phoenix Heaven Immortal Envoy's gaze turned cold, and he stood up, saying.

He shook off the ice crystals on his clothes and walked to Lu Chuanfeng's side, exhaling a white mist.

"If I'm not mistaken, this person is the newly appeared fugitive on the Extermination List, Han Li." Lu Chuanfeng pointed at Han Li.

"Han Li..." The Phoenix Heaven Immortal Envoy heard the name, and his expression changed slightly.

After a moment of thought, he suddenly realized, "It's actually him?"

"How, do you know him, Immortal Envoy?" Lu Chuanfeng asked.

"Hmph, this person has repeatedly opposed us, the Heavenly Court, and previously even killed the East White of the Small Gold Source Heaven Palace, and escaped. Even the Heavenly Court's Miao Fa Immortal Lord personally pursued him, but returned empty-handed. I didn't expect him to appear here." The Phoenix Heaven Immortal Envoy's expression turned joyful, and he quickly said.

"It seems that this person is not an ordinary person." Lu Chuanfeng's eyes narrowed, and he said thoughtfully.
