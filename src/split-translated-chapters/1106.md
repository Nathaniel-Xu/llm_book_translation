Qi Mózǐ saw the two sides facing off, and the atmosphere was somewhat subtle, so he opened his mouth to say, "Everyone, there's no need to be like this. We all have the same goal in coming here, which is to seize the treasure. Although they are yāo and mó, they don't have any deep grudges or hatred towards you, so why must you be so hostile towards them?"

Lei Yùcè sneered and said, "Hmph! Those who are not of our kind must have a different heart. These yāo and mó brought calamity to the heavenly realm's common people, and were suppressed here for no less than a million years. If we say they don't have any hatred towards us, and don't want to devour us, do you think we would believe it?"

Qi Mózǐ smiled and said, "So, Lei Dàoyǒu, do you think we should have a fight to the death here? The one who dies will naturally have no chance of getting the treasure, and the one who lives... how much confidence do you have in being able to pass through the Tiānxiàn Sword Array? Oh... I almost forgot, as a member of the Tiānxiàn Sword Sect, Lei Dàoyǒu, you naturally have a way to pass through it."

Lei Yùcè's expression changed, and his anger grew. Qi Mózǐ's words were indeed vicious and aimed at his heart.

As expected, Jiǎo Sān and the others heard this and began to hesitate.

"Everyone, don't listen to this person's one-sided words. Yāo and mó are like ghosts and demons, and cannot be trusted..." Wén Zhòng frowned and reminded them.

The White Bone Yāo Mó heard this and coldly sneered, "Heh heh, if we talk about being cunning and ruthless, aren't you humans even more so?"

The Copper Lion Yāo Mó said, "Second brother, I've already said it, there's no point in talking to them. It's better to just take action."

The Blood Hand Yāo Mó and the Turtle Back Yāo Mó looked at each other, but neither of them spoke.

The Eagle Nose Yāo Mó also didn't speak, but he glanced at the Copper Lion Yāo Mó, who immediately shrunk his neck and became silent.

The White Bone Yāo Mó saw this and slightly nodded, saying no more.

Lei Yùcè heard this and his heart skipped a beat. Almost everyone was gathered here, so the identity of the person in the array was clear.

If it were anyone else, Lei Yùcè wouldn't be too worried, but the person in the array was likely to be Hàn Lì. That person's strange divine abilities had always been unclear to him, so he naturally couldn't help but be concerned.

Moreover, the Tiānxiàn Sword Array's array diagram must not fall into his hands.

"Alright, Dàoyǒu's words are reasonable, and I have no way to refute them. Let's put aside our differences and work together to break the array, how about that?" Lei Yùcè sighed and said.

Qi Mózǐ looked at the Eagle Nose Yāo Mó, seemingly asking for his opinion.

"Everything is up to Dàoyǒu's decision." The Eagle Nose Yāo Mó nodded and said.

"We have no objections, it's up to you." Qi Mózǐ heard this and said.

Lei Yùcè heard this and turned to look at Jiǎo Sān and the others, who also nodded in agreement.

"To show our sincerity, I have ordered our subordinates to stay far away from here and not approach. I hope Lei Dàoyǒu can also show some sincerity." Qi Mózǐ looked at Lei Yùcè and said.

Lei Yùcè pretended not to understand and asked, "What do you mean, Dàoyǒu?"

"This Tiānxiàn Sword Array is from your Tiānxiàn Sword Sect, Dàoyǒu. Don't you have any method to break the array to teach us?" Qi Mózǐ coldly said.

Lei Yùcè sighed and said, "Dàoyǒu, you don't know that the complete method to set up the array has already been lost in our sect. The sword array has undergone changes over the years, and it's no longer the same as the original. As for how to break the array, I can only figure it out after entering the array."

Qi Mózǐ heard this and raised an eyebrow, clearly not believing his words.

"If Dàoyǒu doesn't believe me, I have no way to convince you. You can try to break the array first, and we won't stop you." Lei Yùcè shrugged and said.

"Alright, since that's the case, let's enter the array together. I believe that once we enter the array, we'll have to rely on Dàoyǒu's strength to break the array." Qi Mózǐ smiled and said.

"Of course, once we enter the array, I'll be able to break the array with confidence." Lei Yùcè nodded and said.

After deciding, the group split into two teams and stood in front of the sword array.

"Everyone, when we enter the array, remember not to move randomly. The more you move, the stronger the array's attack will be. You can try to find a weak point in the array and break it." Just then, Xióng Shān, who had been silent, suddenly spoke up.

His words made Lei Yùcè's heart skip a beat. Almost everyone was gathered here, so the identity of the person in the array was clear.

If it were anyone else, Lei Yùcè wouldn't be too worried, but the person in the array was likely to be Hàn Lì. That person's strange divine abilities had always been unclear to him, so he naturally couldn't help but be concerned.

Moreover, the Tiānxiàn Sword Array's array diagram must not fall into his hands.

"Alright, let's enter the array!" Qi Mózǐ shouted.

As his voice fell, the group surged forward, entering the sword array.

"Follow me..."

Just before entering the array, Lei Yùcè suddenly grabbed Su Qīng's delicate hand and entered the array with her.
Su Zhi's heart skipped a beat, and she felt a faint warmth on her cheeks.

As soon as everyone entered the sword array, the figures flying in mid-air suddenly sank, as if a massive, invisible force had suddenly pressed down on them, causing them to fall to the ground.

Before they could figure out what was happening, the surroundings had already fallen into chaos.

"Rumble, rumble..."

A loud, thunder-like sound echoed in everyone's ears, and the sky and earth were in turmoil. Everywhere, only a yellowish haze could be seen, and above, a dark yellow cloud seemed to be covering everything, making it impossible to see anything clearly.

Su Zhi and Lei Yuze were together, and after entering the array, they could only see each other. The others were nowhere to be seen, and they couldn't even sense their presence.

However, the gravity between the sky and earth seemed to have increased tenfold, making it difficult for them to stand still. They had to rapidly circulate their internal energy to resist this force.

Nearby, a yellow light column rose from the ground, twisting and turning like a dragon, and shooting into the dark yellow cloud. Inside the light column, a stone sword with a dark yellow glow was slanted.

"It seems this array is based on the power of the earth attribute law. Breaking it won't be easy," Lei Yuze said, looking around at the changes.

"What do you mean by 'earth attribute law'?" Su Zhi asked, puzzled.

"The Heavenly Sword Array can communicate with all laws, and it doesn't have any attributes itself. However, the flying swords used to set up the array contain different laws, which can create different array phenomena and attacks. This is why I said that we need to enter the array to know how to break it," Lei Yuze explained quickly.

"If that's the case, how can we break this array?" Su Zhi asked hastily.

"The sword array should be controlled by a cultivator to operate smoothly. Since there is no cultivator controlling this array, it's likely that the array is using the Heavenly Sword Array's diagram as a pivot. To break this array, the fastest way is to find the diagram. Once the diagram is moved, the sword array will be unable to operate," Lei Yuze said after a moment of contemplation.

Just as they were talking, a muffled sound came from above.

"Rumble"

A sound like suppressed thunder echoed from the yellow clouds.

Lei Yuze and Su Zhi instinctively looked up and saw a magnificent heavenly gate standing in the depths of the clouds. The dark yellow gate was half-closed, revealing a narrow slit.

Through the slit, a massive yellow whirlpool could be seen inside, emitting waves of earth attribute law energy that made their hearts tremble.

Su Zhi was about to speak when the whirlpool inside the gate suddenly flashed with light, and a series of dark yellow light columns shot out from the gate, falling towards the ground.

These light columns condensed into giant yellow swords, each tens of meters long, and fell towards the sword array. Two of the swords fell towards Lei Yuze and Su Zhi, and before they even reached them, a suffocating pressure descended upon them, as if the air above their heads was being compressed.

"Su Zhi, be careful..."

Lei Yuze warned, then stood in front of her, his hands raised in a "supporting the heavens" gesture.

His body glowed with light, and a circular symbol appeared on the ground, emitting a golden light. A series of giant, illusory swords shot out from the symbol, rising into the air and colliding with the two giant swords.

The sound of the collision was deafening, and the two giant swords continued to fall, their pressure crushing.

Lei Yuze's eyes widened in shock, and he muttered, "Is this the true power of the Heavenly Sword Array?"

Just then, a blue light flashed beside him, and a water attribute law energy spread out.

Su Zhi was surrounded by a blue glow, her hands clasped together in front of her, holding a small, round bead that emitted a gentle blue light. The bead was filled with a swirling blue water that seemed to be moving on its own.

Su Zhi's eyes were closed, and her eyelashes were slightly raised, giving her an ethereal beauty. She seemed to be one with the blue light, and her presence was captivating.

Suddenly, her eyes opened, and she raised her hand towards the sky.

"Whoosh"

A sound like a wave crashing echoed through the air, and the blue water around her hand suddenly surged upwards, forming a massive wave that crashed into the two giant swords.

The swords were momentarily slowed down, but they didn't dissipate. Instead, they continued to fall, their pressure still intense.
