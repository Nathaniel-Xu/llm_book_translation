Shaxin and Shi Zhanteng's toes lightly touched the surface of the Blood Lake, and they stood by the water, beside the crystal coffin. The lake's surface rippled with waves.

Shaxin looked at the skeleton inside the crystal coffin, and her eyes flickered with complex emotions. She took a deep breath and said:

"Shi fellow, lend me your vital blood. I promise to repay you after this matter is settled."

Shi Zhanteng nodded silently, lifted his palm, and made a heavy stroke on the Three- Edged Sword in his hand. A cut opened on his palm, and a few strands of dark red blood with a hint of golden light flowed out.

Shaxin saw this and took out a star-pen carved from white bone, covered in intricate hollow patterns, from her sleeve pocket.

With a stroke, the star-pen was stained with Shi Zhanteng's vital blood. It began to dance and draw on the crystal coffin at an incredible speed.

The dark red bloodstains turned into lines, forming a large blood-colored symbol array on the coffin, complementing the complex five-pronged star map on the crystal coffin and blending into one.

Han Li frowned and looked away, only to see the crystal coffin glowing bright red. The coffin's body was shaking violently, causing the entire Blood Lake to ripple.

A layer of blood-red lake water spread out like a living thing, covering the entire crystal coffin and transforming it into a giant blood cocoon.

A loud "Boom" shook the air.

E Xian continued to attack the surrounding bone chain array that trapped him, with an unstoppable force.

The lightning-covered restraint array absorbed the star power in the attack and blocked the blow, but the cracks on the twelve bone suits of armor increased twofold.

A faint sound echoed.

The twelve white chess pieces on the array plate in front of "Xiaozi" (Little Purple) all cracked open.

Her body trembled violently, and her pale face, covered in black silk, was devoid of any blood color.

Han Li noticed this and his expression tightened, with a hint of hesitation in his eyes.

Under the current circumstances, if he were to act rashly, it was hard to say what actions E Xian and Shaxin would take. Han Li didn't dare to guarantee that his temporary intervention wouldn't backfire and cause unforeseen consequences for "Little Purple."

Although he knew that "Little Purple" was likely Zilong, this wasn't the time to reveal her identity.

Just then, a muffled voice came from the crystal coffin, enveloped in the blood cocoon.

The blood water on the cocoon flowed downward, revealing the legendary saintly skeleton. However, the crystal coffin had vanished, leaving only a blood-red crystal plate beneath the skeleton, floating on the surface of the Blood Lake.

The saint's skeleton appeared without any grand or unusual signs. The corpse itself didn't emit any exceptionally intense energy fluctuations, resembling an ordinary demon corpse.

But when Han Li's gaze fell on the blood-colored crystal plate beneath the skeleton, a glint of surprise appeared in his eyes.

He saw that the crystal plate was covered in mysterious and incomprehensible symbols. Although most of them were unfamiliar to him, the small part he recognized revealed the plate's function – suppressing the blood energy within the skeleton.

E Xian's gaze, piercing through the lightning, looked over, with an increasingly greedy glint in his eyes. He launched another frenzied attack on the confinement array that trapped him.

Shaxin noticed this and focused her gaze, dismissing all nostalgic thoughts. She quickly formed hand seals in front of her.

She whispered incantations, her fingers rotating like blooming flower petals. In front of her, she pinched out a bizarre and intricate spell seal. Pressing her palm against her lower abdomen, a layer of her skin flipped open, revealing a mechanical, clockwork-like interior.

A dazzling white light burst forth from her lower abdomen, accompanied by the sound of machinery whirring.

"It's been transformed into a puppet..." Liu Huaming exclaimed in surprise.

Han Li furrowed his brow, equally astonished.

From the opening in her abdomen, a brilliant, blood-colored glow burst forth, illuminating the surroundings.

The blood-filled lake surrounding them, save for Shaxin and E Xian, was filled with people whose faces all showed shock and astonishment.

Within the blood-colored light, a crystal orb containing a living heart appeared.

Han Li saw through the crystal orb that the heart was still beating – jumping up and down. He could even hear the sound of its rhythmic beats:

"Thump, thump, thump..."

A powerful life force also emanated from the heart.

After removing the heart, Shaxin's opening in her abdomen started to close, layer by layer, like a lily petal folding in. Her entire being weakened, as if she had lost half of her strength; her face turned pale.
"Ha ha... I didn't think that to protect this heart, you would actually nourish it within your own body, yet you dare not take anything from it. No wonder you haven't made any progress in so many years, your cultivation has even regressed significantly. How foolish!" Er Bi said with a loud laugh.

Shaxin turned her back to Er Bi, not looking at him. She took out a beast pill and swallowed it, then grasped the crystal ball with both hands. Her palms began to shine with dazzling white light, as she tried to retrieve the sealed heart.

Just then, a sudden change occurred!

Shaxin's expression changed abruptly, and she let out a low groan.

A white, pointed bone suddenly protruded from her chest, piercing her heart.

The white, pointed bone had three grooved slots, guiding the heart's blood to flow out, instantly staining half her body red.

"Sorry, Shazhong..." Shi Zhanfeng, standing behind Shaxin, said expressionlessly, his hand tightening around the three-edged bone sword. A crumbling sound came from her chest cavity.

Shaxin suddenly spat out blood, her body twisting rapidly as she swung her palm at Shi Zhanfeng's head.

However, he had already released the three-edged bone sword and dodged to the side. His body's acupoints flashed rapidly, and his speed reached an extreme point. He slid past her side, a white bone dagger appearing in his palm, which he stabbed into Shaxin's abdomen.

At the same time, his body surged forward, and he snatched the crystal ball from Shaxin's hand. He retreated violently, landing on the other side of the bloody lake, creating distance between himself and Shaxin's group.

Before everyone could react to the sudden change, another explosion occurred on the shore of the bloody lake.

A loud "boom" shook the air.

A massive silver electric light burst forth, fragmenting into countless silver snake-like lightning bolts that shot in all directions, causing the entire underground space to shudder.

White bones shattered and dispersed, striking the ceiling and walls, riddled with numerous holes.

Han Li's gaze narrowed, his body bending downward. A fragmented white bone flew toward him, shaving off the bizarre rock that was shielding him.

The bone chain formation that was trapping Er Bi finally shattered, and the twelve bone puppet suits exploded one by one. The twelve white chess pieces also burst, taking the black array disk with them. Xicao, who was controlling the formation, stumbled backward, spitting up blood from her mouth.

After escaping, Er Bi didn't bother with Xicao. He glanced at Shaxin, who still had the bone sword lodged in her heart, then looked at Shi Zhanfeng and smiled, "Congratulations, Crown Prince. You've obtained the heart."

"Thank you, Lord Er Bi, for helping me," Shi Zhanfeng replied with a smile.

"Originally... it seems you two were in cahoots all along." Shaxin pulled out the three-edged bone sword from her heart, her brow furrowed in displeasure.

Er Bi chuckled, "Shazhong, forgive me. Was our previous performance convincing enough?"

Shaxin remained silent.

Earlier, Er Bi had been chasing Shi Zhanfeng, and she hadn't immediately intervened, intending to gauge his true loyalties. However, she had underestimated their cunning.

She reached into her sleeve and retrieved a small black stone bottle. She opened the bottle and poured out a golden, sand-like substance, which she applied to the wound on her heart. The golden sand instantly swirled into the wound, repairing the damage.

"Without the heart, you no longer have the chance to revive your master. I'll give you one more opportunity to share this holy skeleton with me," Er Bi said, addressing Shaxin as "master" for the first time.

Shaxin ignored him, her palm opening to reveal a metal ball the size of a dragon's eye.

"Xicao, retrieve the heart at all costs."

"It seems you want to oppose me to the end. I won't hold back our past connection," Er Bi sneered, leaping toward the center of the bloody lake.

Shaxin swung her palm, and the metal ball shot out, lighting up the air. A golden giant emerged, its body like copper and iron, adorned with intricate iron chain armor and eight arms, all bare and muscular. The giant's eyes glowed red as its eight arms struck simultaneously, conjuring a tempest.

Er Bi snickered and raised his fist to meet the giant's attack.

His body's acupoints flashed rapidly, like starlight. His punch shattered the air, producing countless fist shadows that clashed with the giant's eight arms.

A deafening crash echoed through the underground space, accompanied by the sounds of thunder and raging winds.

On the other side, Xicao, now back on her feet, controlled two peculiar puppets that appeared before her. One was humanoid with four metallic wings on its back, while the other was beast-like, with a young girl's head, and resembled a tiger or leopard.

The two puppets charged at Shi Zhanfeng from left, right, above, and below.
