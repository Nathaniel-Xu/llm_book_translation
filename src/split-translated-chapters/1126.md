At the same time, the outside of the Years Tower was already in a state of chaos.

The entire tower was beginning to show signs of massive cracks, with silver light flashing from within, and powerful spatial fluctuations emanating from it.

Before long, people began to emerge from the cracks, including humans, demons, and monsters, with varying shapes and cultivation levels, densely packed and blocking out the sky.

The disciples of the various sects stationed outside the tower were initially shocked, and wanted to retreat, but many of the people who emerged from the cracks attacked without hesitation, and the disciples were forced to defend themselves under the leadership of their respective leaders.

However, at first, relying on their numerical advantage, they were able to suppress some of the people who emerged, but as the number of people increased, some extremely powerful existences began to appear, and the balance of power began to shift.

Outside the Years Tower, the sound of killing and shouting shook the heavens, and both sides suffered heavy casualties, with blood flowing like rivers.

……

On the other side, Han Li and Qu Lin had caught up to the scene, and saw that Jiao San had already released the Wheel of Rebirth, covering an area of hundreds of miles.

Inside her dark red spirit domain, there was another layer of golden spirit domain, which was clearly released by Qimozi.

Lirixima, who had entered the two spirit domains, suddenly slowed down.

His eyes widened, and his four hooves galloped out, creating white whirlwinds that shot out from his feet, stirring up the surrounding space, and his speed increased dramatically.

When Han Li and Qu Lin entered the spirit domain, a golden light ball suddenly appeared, transforming into a layer of time spirit domain, covering an area of hundreds of miles.

As they approached, they found that Qimozi and the others had stopped fighting, and were standing facing each other.

"As long as you hand over the items you obtained from the altar, we can let you go, and you can leave on your own," Jiao San said, her hands forming a seal, but not attacking.

"Hmph, with the Years God Lamp in hand, I'm not afraid of you," Qimozi sneered.

"Qimozi, what about us?" Han Li sneered.

Seeing Han Li arrive with Lirixima and Qu Lin, Qimozi's expression changed, and he realized that he was no match for them.

Moreover, Qu Lin, Liu Zixin, and Lirixima were all powerful cultivators, and even with the Years God Lamp in hand, he was still at a disadvantage.

Just then, Qimozi suddenly remembered something, and a sly smile appeared on his face. He flipped his hand, and a blood-red token appeared in his palm.

"This life token is yours, isn't it? If you don't want me to destroy it, then kill him for me," Qimozi said, his eyes falling on Liu Zixin, and commanding him.

Liu Zixin's eyes flashed, and he looked at Han Li, a hint of hesitation on his face.

"You don't have a choice, believe me, I'll crush it," Qimozi said, his mouth twisting.

"Sorry..."

Liu Zixin's eyes flashed with anger, and he spoke, his body flashing towards Han Li.

"Old fox, sorry, but I won't let you kill him," Qu Lin said, intercepting him.

Lirixima hesitated for a moment, and then his body glowed with white light, transforming into a massive whirlwind that enveloped Qu Lin and Liu Zixin, and sent them flying out of the spirit domain.

"Haha, without them, do you dare to fight me?" Qimozi sneered.

Han Li and Jiao San exchanged a glance, and nodded to each other. The three of them spread out, surrounding Qimozi in the center.

"I admire your bravery, but I'm afraid you don't know the true power of the Years God Lamp," Qimozi said, his eyes scanning the three of them.

Han Li and the others felt a sense of unease, and their hearts tightened with a bad premonition.

"Let me show you," Qimozi said, his hands forming a seal.

The golden lamp shot out, floating in front of him, spinning rapidly.

Qimozi's hands formed a seal, and his aura surged, his clothes flapping wildly.

In front of him, a golden flame condensed, and a fire torch appeared, its flame flickering.

Qimozi's eyes fell on the fire torch and the Years God Lamp, and a crazed look appeared in his eyes. His hands formed a seal, and he shouted:

"Cut off time, cut off space, the fire will not be extinguished, the Years God Lamp will shine forever."
As soon as the words left his lips, the lotus heart-like wick in the lantern on the lotus lake suddenly burst forth with countless golden rays of light, shining brightly in the sky like the sun. Rolling golden waves of light emanated from within, churning and surging like a sea of clouds.

"This is...not good, stop him quickly!" Han Li shouted, his voice stern.

As he spoke, he activated the Heavenly Executioner's Prison technique with all his might, and his palm shot out with a burst of golden light. The thirty-six bamboo swords merged into one, wrapped in dense lightning, and shot straight towards Qí Mó Zǐ.

Jiǎo Sān was a step slower, but he also swung his hand and struck out with a palm, releasing a flying eight-cornered token from his palm. The token was wrapped in a swirling dark red mist, which gathered into a massive fog wall that advanced towards Qí Mó Zǐ.

On the other side, Jiǎo Sān's Heavenly Fox Blood Knife had already been unsheathed, and hundreds of massive blood-colored blades sliced through the void, tearing apart the sky and falling towards Qí Mó Zǐ.

The three attacks were all incredibly powerful, and even a Daluo cultivator would not dare to underestimate them.

But Qí Mó Zǐ, who was at the center of the attacks, seemed completely unaware, and only manipulated the incantation, using all his might to activate the golden fireball, which landed on the Years of the Gods Lamp.

"Rumble rumble..."

Just as the golden lightning-wrapped bamboo sword was about to reach him, the dark red mist wall had already obscured the sky, and the Heavenly Fox Blood Knife's blades were about to fall, the golden fireball and the Years of the Gods Lamp finally merged into one.

In the instant they merged, a dazzling golden light burst forth, releasing a golden glow that was a hundred times more intense than sunlight, causing Han Li's vision to lose its effect.

Han Li only heard a loud rumble, which came from Qí Mó Zǐ's direction, and then he was pushed back by a violent gust of air, his body involuntarily retreating.

After stabilizing his body, he used his mind to connect with the bamboo sword, and with a wave of his hand, the sword flew back into his hand.

Han Li's eyes narrowed as he gazed in the direction of Qí Mó Zǐ, and in the midst of the rolling smoke and dust, a massive shadow stood upright, resembling a giant pillar that supported the sky.

But when the smoke and dust cleared, he finally saw that the object in the smoke was a golden oil lamp over a hundred feet tall, its pillar slightly curved, and its lamp resembling a lotus flower. It was unmistakably the Years of the Gods Lamp.

"This is...the Years of the Gods Lamp?" Jiǎo Sān's voice came from beside him.

Han Li turned his head and saw that she was only slightly disheveled, with no major issues.

"It seems he has used some secret technique to fully grasp the Years of the Gods Lamp, but under such hasty circumstances, it's impossible to maintain it for long. We should be cautious in our response," Han Li said, frowning in thought.

"I don't think it's that simple. This old fellow has enlarged the lamp, and the aura of the lamp is not only not wildly released, but it's actually restrained, which is abnormal in itself," Hú Sān said, flying back with a disheveled appearance.

Han Li listened, closed his eyes, and carefully probed for a moment, his face slightly changing.

"Hú Sān is right, Qí Mó Zǐ has merged the Years of the Gods Lamp with his spiritual domain, and the lamp has become like the domain spirit within his spiritual domain. It's not going to be easy to deal with," Han Li said, his eyes fixed intently on the lamp.

Just then, Qí Mó Zǐ's figure suddenly appeared on the surface of the massive Years of the Gods Lamp, standing on one of the lotus petals, looking down at the three of them with a smile.

"Haha...Han fellow, do you still have a few chances of winning?" Qí Mó Zǐ laughed loudly.

Without waiting for Han Li to respond, he suddenly pinched his fingers together, pointing at the lamp below.

The massive Years of the Gods Lamp suddenly shook violently, and the flames that covered the wick burst forth, shooting out countless golden flames in all directions.

Han Li and the others quickly scattered, avoiding the flames.

The golden flames landed on the ground, but they did not splash or disappear. Instead, they flashed with a golden light, transforming into a series of golden lamps, each about a hundred feet tall, resembling the Years of the Gods Lamp.

The golden lamps were densely packed throughout the spiritual domain, with one appearing every ten or so feet.

Han Li quickly discovered that after the appearance of the lamp's avatars, the fluctuations in the time law within Qí Mó Zǐ's spiritual domain had increased tenfold, and even with Han Li's time spiritual domain to counter it, their actions were still greatly hindered.

"Let's try this again..." Qí Mó Zǐ suddenly shouted from the lamp.

Han Li looked over and saw Qí Mó Zǐ's sleeves shaking, and the wide sleeves opening with a "whooshing" sound.

A fiery red glow surged from within the sleeves, and a dense cluster of red light points emerged, instantly covering a patch of sky.

"Not good, it's the Fire Age Fireflies!" Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he shouted loudly.

As soon as his words fell, the Fire Age Fireflies split into three groups, each rushing towards the three of them.

Hearing Han Li's warning, Jiǎo Sān and the others also realized that things were getting troublesome, and they quickly used their techniques to protect themselves.

Jiǎo Sān's robes shone with a silver light, and a dense array of symbols appeared on the surface, emitting a hazy glow that contained a layer of spatial law, resembling a barrier that enveloped her.

Hú Sān, on the other hand, had a layer of scaly armor appear on his body, with dense, glowing symbols that completely encased him.
