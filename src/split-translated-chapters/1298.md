Han Li's eyes widened as he watched the scene unfold before him. "Xue Li, you're actually...!" Gu Wu shouted, but he was too late to stop Xue Li's actions.

A massive axe appeared above Xue Li, its blade flashing with a brilliant light. The air was filled with a deafening roar as the axe descended, its blade biting deep into the void. A massive blood-red axe shadow appeared, its power so great that it seemed to split the very fabric of space.

The axe shadow plummeted towards Han Li, its power so overwhelming that it seemed to fill the entire sky. Han Li didn't even flinch, simply raising his hand to meet the axe. A brilliant golden light burst forth from his sleeve, coalescing into a massive golden palm print that clashed with the axe.

The two energies collided in a spectacular display, the sound of their impact echoing through the air. The axe shattered, its fragments dispersing into the distance, but the golden palm print continued to shine, its power undiminished.

Xue Li landed back on the giant turtle's back, his eyes fixed on the palm print as it disappeared into the distance. "How...how is this possible?" he muttered, his voice trembling with shock.

The white skeleton on the turtle's back turned to face Han Li, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly energy. "Xue Li, you fool! Why did you attack without thinking? Don't you know that I and the Lord of the Underworld are on this ship?" Gu Wu shouted, his voice filled with anger.

Xue Li looked at Gu Wu in surprise, his voice shaking. "Gu Wu, you're...you're not dead yet?"

Gu Wu ignored him, his body glowing with a soft blue light as he rose into the air. His form expanded, his body growing larger as he bowed deeply towards the white skeleton. "I, Gu Wu, pay my respects to the Bone Emperor."

The white skeleton nodded, its voice like a gentle breeze. "I am the Bone Emperor. Why have you, a true immortal, allied yourself with the mortals?"

Gu Wu's voice was filled with respect. "It's because we share a common goal, Bone Emperor. We wish to defeat the Wheel King, and this Han Li is also seeking to do the same. May I ask, will you permit us to join forces and work together to defeat the Wheel King?"

Han Li's eyes narrowed, his mind racing with thoughts. He had never agreed to work with Gu Wu and the others, and he had only agreed to let them join him because he was interested in the Six Paths of Reincarnation.

The Bone Emperor's voice was like a gentle whisper. "It's not a problem, but tell me, what is your goal in defeating the Wheel King?"

Gu Wu's voice was filled with excitement. "We want to use the Six Paths of Reincarnation to defeat the Wheel King and gain control over the cycle of life and death."

Han Li's eyes narrowed, his mind racing with thoughts. He didn't want to get involved in the conflicts of the Underworld, and he didn't know what the Bone Emperor's true intentions were.

The Bone Emperor's voice was like a gentle breeze. "I will permit you to join forces, but remember, I am the one who will decide the outcome of this battle."

Han Li's eyes narrowed, his mind racing with thoughts. He didn't know what the Bone Emperor's true intentions were, and he didn't want to get involved in the conflicts of the Underworld.

Suddenly, a black-faced giant stepped forward, his voice filled with respect. "Bone Emperor, may I break through the barrier that blocks our path?"

The Bone Emperor nodded, his voice like a gentle breeze. "You may proceed."

The black-faced giant raised his hands, and a massive black giant appeared behind him. The giant's body was covered in black armor, its surface etched with intricate patterns.

The black giant's eyes glowed with an otherworldly energy, its power so great that it seemed to fill the entire sky. Han Li's eyes narrowed, his mind racing with thoughts. He didn't know what the black giant's true intentions were, and he didn't want to get involved in the conflicts of the Underworld.

The black giant raised its hands, and a massive black energy burst forth, shattering the barrier that blocked their path. The group continued on their journey, their destination unknown.
The black-armored ghostly creature let out a deafening roar, its body radiating a dark glow that formed a turbulent black storm, pushing away the surrounding whirlwinds.

Zi Ling's cultivation was slightly weaker, and he was almost blown away by the storm.

A hand reached out from the side and grabbed him, pulling him back. It was Han Li.

"Thank you, Brother Han," Zi Ling said with a sigh, expressing his gratitude.

Han Li waved his hand dismissively, looking at the black-armored ghostly creature and then glancing at the Blood Cloud Wall. He shook his head slightly.

As the black-armored ghostly creature roared, its four massive arms struck out in unison, each fist radiating a swirling black glow that emitted a piercing explosion sound as it hit the Blood Cloud Wall.

A loud, muffled sound echoed out.

The Blood Cloud Wall only trembled, its surface rippling like water, without showing any signs of damage.

The black-faced giant's eyes widened in shock as he witnessed this scene.

At that moment, a flash of blood light appeared within the ripples on the Blood Cloud Wall, and over a dozen thick, blood-red lightning bolts shot out without warning, striking the black-armored ghostly creature.

The ghostly creature's body was easily pierced by the lightning bolts, its exquisite black armor shattering, and it let out a blood-curdling scream as its massive body dissipated into a cloud of black smoke.

The black-faced giant stumbled backward, his body shaking violently, and he almost fell to the ground. He spat out a mouthful of blood.

"Trash!" Gu Huang snorted, his voice cold and disdainful.

The black-faced giant's body trembled, and he quickly apologized, his heart filled with regret for trying to take the initiative and show off.

"Using the Six Paths Wheel to manipulate the whirlwinds and create a natural defense is understandable, but in the face of absolute power, everything is futile," Gu Huang said, his eyes scanning the Blood Cloud Wall as he spoke. He snorted again, raising his hand to make a grasping motion.

A massive, earth-shaking sound echoed out.

The entire void seemed to collapse, and a gigantic white bone palm appeared, grasping the Blood Cloud Wall.

The sound of shattering echoed out as the previously indestructible Blood Cloud Wall suddenly became fragile, breaking apart to reveal a large hole.

"Senior Gu Huang's divine powers are boundless!" Xue Li exclaimed.

"With Senior Gu Huang taking action, it seems that the Turning Wheel King is doomed to perish!" Gui Wu laughed, his eyes gleaming with excitement.

Han Li gazed at Gu Huang, a hint of apprehension flashing in his eyes.

He had witnessed the power of the Dao Ancestors before, but at the time, his cultivation was still weak, and he couldn't truly comprehend their might. Now, with his increased cultivation and understanding of the Dao, he could finally appreciate the terror of a Dao Ancestor's power.

Gu Huang's every move seemed to resonate with the Heavenly Dao, as if he were the embodiment of the heavens themselves. This kind of power was something that even a great existence like the Turning Wheel King couldn't withstand.

Gu Huang listened to the praise from Xue Li and Gui Wu, a hint of pride flashing in his eyes. He raised his hand, and the massive turtle beneath their feet began to move forward, flying into the hole in the wall.

"Who dares to invade?" a voice shouted from within the island.

The island's guardians had already discovered the anomaly when the black-faced giant attacked, and now they saw Gu Huang and the others, rushing towards them.

At the same time, the alarm sounded, and guardians from other parts of the island rushed towards them.

"Leave these trivial soldiers to us," Xue Li said, charging forward with a loud whoop. His massive axe transformed into a blood-red streak, sweeping across the battlefield.

A loud, piercing sound echoed out, and dozens of ghostly soldiers were cut down.

Gu Huang's seven companions also charged forward, killing the ghostly soldiers.

Han Li and the others couldn't just stand by, so they also drew out their magical artifacts and joined the battle.

The island's ghostly soldiers were incredibly powerful, with many of them possessing Tai Yi boundary cultivation. Although no great existences had appeared, their numbers were vast, and Han Li's group was unable to gain the upper hand, being blocked at the entrance.

"Everyone, retreat!" Gu Huang's eyes flashed with impatience, and he waved his hand, signaling for the others to fall back. A bone-white glow erupted from his body.

A wave of bone-white energy shot out, sweeping across the island in a fan-shaped pattern, instantly killing the ghostly soldiers.

The island's guardians were torn apart, their bodies exploding as their bones shattered. The sound of their deaths echoed out, and the island was bathed in a bloody, gruesome scene.

The only survivors were the few ghostly soldiers who had managed to hide near the gray-white stone temple.

A dark red, dome-shaped energy shield appeared around the temple, protecting it from Gu Huang's attack.

"Senior Gu Huang's divine powers are truly boundless!" Xue Li exclaimed once more.

The others also praised Gu Huang's abilities.

The two ghostly generals, Niutou and Mamian, who had been standing guard at the temple entrance, finally showed signs of concern on their faces. They began to gather the remaining ghostly soldiers to defend the entrance, while also sending someone to report to the temple.

As the battle subsided, the island's guardians lay dead, their bodies scattered across the ground.
