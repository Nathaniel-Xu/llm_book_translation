Han Li passed through the layers of white jade bookshelves surrounding him and approached the crystal tower. Upon closer inspection, he discovered that the tower was not carved with any spell patterns, nor was it a fairy treasure. It was simply a uniquely shaped storage shelf.

The crystal tower was divided into eight compartments on each layer, with each compartment containing numerous jade slips and silk papers.

The bottom layer had the largest space and the most books, mostly in the form of books and scrolls, densely accumulated, with about a hundred or so in just one compartment.

As one went higher, each layer of the tower became smaller, and the number of books that could be stored inside became fewer. At the top layer, there were only eight remaining, all in the form of jade slips.

With Crab Taoist's previous words in mind, Han Li had no reservations. He casually took out a jade slip, glanced at it, and then raised his hand to place it on his forehead, carefully examining it.

After a moment, he put down the jade slip in his hand, and his expression changed slightly.

The jade slip he had just put down contained a puppet refining technique called " Hundred Refinements into a Puppet." Han Li was astonished after just a brief scan.

Just the materials used for the puppets were discussed from three aspects: "Heavenly Time," " Geographical Advantage," and " Human Harmony." It not only fully demonstrated the influence of different puppet materials on the quality of the refined puppets but also detailed the importance of refining puppets with different attributes under various heavenly time environments.

However, Han Li's mind was not focused on this at the moment. He wanted to look for some cultivation-related books to see if he could find any techniques or divine powers to suppress or resolve the backlash of the True Spirit bloodline within his body.

So, after putting away the " Hundred Refinements into a Puppet," he continued to pick up other jade slips and place them on his forehead for viewing.

...

In the blink of an eye, seven days passed.

Han Li sat cross-legged, leaning against a corner of the main hall, holding a scroll named " Star Element Blood Refining Technique," carefully examining it.

The content recorded in this technique was indeed unique, different from the common cultivation techniques of tempering the body, muscles, and even tendons and bones. It boldly proposed using the power of the stars to refine the blood.

By cultivating this technique, a cultivator's blood could also be refined, allowing the blood to contain a large amount of star power. When fighting enemies, occasionally using the blood flowing out of wounds as an attack method often produced unexpected effects.

Moreover, the blood of those who practiced this technique often contained more energy. When using some blood-burning secret techniques, they often had an even more terrifying power boost.

However, this technique was extremely difficult to cultivate. During the process of introducing star power into the blood, not only did one have to endure unimaginable pain, but they also had to bear enormous risks.

Because blood travels throughout the body through veins, passing through important points such as the heart and dantian, if one lost control and the star power in the blood went out of control, it would be a life-threatening situation.

However, after reading it, Han Li only marveled at it and had no intention of cultivating this technique. The scroll clearly stated that this technique was not suitable for people with special bloodlines to cultivate.

The reason was simple: the blood power of these people was stronger, making it more difficult to control the fusion of their blood and star power. Han Li's bloodline power was already quite complex. If he wanted to cultivate this technique, it would be like adding fuel to the fire, seeking his own death.

However, this technique was not completely useless for Han Li. The various blood circulation methods and ways to calm the turmoil of star power mentioned in it were very useful.

As for how to cultivate and learn, Han Li still needed to carefully extract the beneficial parts.

After a while, he slowly rolled up the scroll, rubbed his slightly painful forehead, and slowly stood up, placing it back on the crystal tower.

In these few days, he had gone through all the books on this tower, but the useful information he found was not much.

Even the " Star Element Blood Refining Technique" he just found could only serve an auxiliary purpose and could not completely solve his current predicament.

However, since he had found some alleviating methods, Han Li decided to try cultivating them.

He turned around and left the main hall, heading towards another main hall.

When Han Li arrived at the central hall where the star formation was operating, he saw that Crab Taoist in the formation had already been completely covered by a layer of blood-colored crystal light. The light refracted, making it impossible to see his figure clearly.

Han Li did not linger. He only glanced briefly before turning around and leaving.

As soon as he entered another main hall, Han Li felt as if he had bumped into a wall of qi. Immediately after, it seemed as if his entire body was wrapped in a warm current, extremely comfortable.

He looked around and discovered that the entire main hall was filled with various spell patterns. The ceiling and floor were carved with star patterns, flickering unpredictably.

Among them were river-like patterns, with white light flowing like water waves, looking incredibly dazzling.

"No wonder this was Crab Taoist's closed-door cultivation place. The star power here is so dense..." Han Li couldn't help but exclaim upon seeing this.
After finishing his words, he arrived at a lotus platform in the center of the great hall and sat down cross-legged.

Underneath Han Li's buttocks, a white halo of light immediately lit up, as if a cotton cushion had been inserted, making it very comfortable.

After sitting down, he closed his eyes and rested for a while before starting to recall the "Xingyuan Blood Refining Technique" he had just seen in his mind, but he did not immediately start cultivating it.

He directly ignored the part about how to draw the power of the stars into his body to refine his blood, and only selected the latter half of the technique on how to calm the power of the stars to learn.

The star power emphasized in the technique was actually not much different from the nature of the True Spirit Bloodline. When it became violent, the power was uncontrollable. On one hand, it would burn the essence and blood in the body, and on the other hand, it would break through the blood vessels, causing the whole body to explode.

Han Li relied on his strong physique to avoid the fate of his body exploding and dying to a certain extent, but he could not avoid the boiling heat of his blood. After it was completely burned, his whole body would wither and die.

After thinking for a long time, Han Li began to follow the mnemonics in the technique, pinching his fingers and silently cultivating.

...

Time flew by, and more than eight years passed.

In the closed-door cultivation hall, Han Li sat cross-legged on the lotus platform. His entire body was red, and pink mist steamed from his body, filling the room as if a hot spring had been opened.

His eyes were as red as blood, but the divine light in his pupils was calm, without any sense of panic.

He then formed a strange hand seal, and a chanting sound came from his mouth. His body tilted to the right, and he propped up his head with one hand and bent one leg, making a pose of a sleeping Buddha.

As he laid down in this pose, the star power in his body surged like river waves, from his head to his feet, and from his feet to his head. It circulated steadily, gradually suppressing his raging True Spirit Bloodline.

The red color on his body also began to recede from his head to his neck, from his neck to his chest, gradually returning to normal.

"Success! The effort I put in during this time was not in vain..." After a while, Han Li sat up and a smile appeared on his face.

In these eight years, except for a small amount of time when Han Li went to the hall where the techniques were stored to read books, he spent most of his time in the closed-door secret room cultivating the Xingyuan Blood Refining Technique.

After countless attempts, he finally gradually mastered the method to calm his True Spirit Bloodline.

Han Li stood up, stretched, and looked up. He suddenly saw a star map carved above his head, with its light flashing constantly. The Milky Way engraved on it was like a jade belt hanging horizontally in the air. Although it was mysterious and beautiful, it was not as gorgeous as before.

"It seems to be another clear sky with sparse stars..." Han Li was in a good mood and muttered to himself.

He had discovered early on that although the crystal palace he was in was located under the blood lake, it could connect with the outside starry sky. Every time night fell and stars filled the sky, the star map above the palace would light up like the stars.

The denser the stars in the night sky, the brighter the star map in the crystal palace would be, and the denser the star power it would absorb. Today, the moon was clearly in the sky, but the starlight seemed a bit dim.

Han Li looked at it for a while, and suddenly had a thought. He reached into his arms and, after fumbling for a while, took out a small dark green bottle that had accompanied him throughout his cultivation journey. He bent down and placed it on the ground.

The light projected from the roof above spilled onto the small dark green bottle, giving it a soft glow and clearly outlining the patterns on the bottle's body.

However, after waiting for a long time, the small bottle just stayed still in place without any change.

"Sure enough, it doesn't work? It seems that only the starlight can be transmitted into this crystal palace..." Before he could finish his words, his eyebrows raised slightly, and a very familiar scene appeared before his eyes.

A hazy white light enveloped the small bottle, and the leaf-like patterns on it also lit up, making the whole bottle body crystal clear. White spots of light formed around the bottle, turning into a huge white halo that glowed with a soft light.

However, the speed at which these white spots of light gathered was indeed a bit slow, much slower than before in other places.

Han Li looked at it for a while, then put the small bottle away again. He was just curious and wanted to try it, but he didn't plan to use the Palm Heaven Bottle to gather green liquid, because in this Jilin Kong Realm, there was no need for this item for the time being.

After putting it away, he turned around and left the hall, and went to the hall of books again.

...

More than a month later, one day.

Han Li sat cross-legged in the closed-door cultivation hall and took out three items from his sleeves, placing them one by one in front of him.

They were four ancient statues made of the same material, which seemed to be some kind of demon race creature, all in the shape of three heads and six arms, but their facial expressions and action details were very different.
