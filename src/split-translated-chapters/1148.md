Han Li didn't pay attention to the situation at the entrance of the pavilion, and instead looked inside.

The first floor of the pavilion was not large, and there were rows of ancient wooden bookshelves, with over 20-30 of them. Each bookshelf was filled with dense rows of ancient texts, jade slips, and other items, all neatly arranged. These texts were all related to cultivation techniques and secret arts.

The texts on the bookshelves were also shrouded in a layer of white light, similar to the seal on the entrance of the pavilion.

Han Li gave a rough glance and his heart was filled with joy. This place was indeed similar to a scripture repository of a sect, just as he had guessed.

He had finally returned to the True Speech Sect after much difficulty, and he didn't want to leave empty-handed.

Ever since he arrived in the True Immortal Realm, he had been investigating the history of the True Speech Sect due to some unresolved matters. The more he investigated, the more he was shocked.

Although the True Speech Sect was located in the Black Earth Immortal Domain, which was not a large domain, its research into the Time Law was exceptional, especially the insights of the old ancestor Mi Luo. This made the sect's reputation in the True Immortal Realm not low.

Now, he had spent 50 Time Law crystals to come here, and although the reason was to escape those two Grand Luo Realm cultivators, he had to gain something from this trip. Otherwise, it would be a great loss.

Actually, he had always been self-taught in the cultivation of the Time Law, one of the three supreme laws. Although his progress was much faster than others due to the Heavenly Vessel, if he could find one or two texts left behind by the True Speech Sect's ancestors, he could gain some insights.

The Time Law was a profound and difficult law, but it was also the most fundamental law in this realm.

Even ordinary people, or even a tiny ant, could not escape the Time Law in their entire lives. The fate of living beings, the birth and death of all things, the changes of the mountains and rivers... all these were governed by the Time Law.

So, every cultivator who cultivated the Time Law, no matter how long they took, would have some insights to share. Even a single sentence could help someone gain a sudden understanding.

Han Li thought for a moment, then quickly walked through the bookshelves, occasionally stopping to open the seal on a bookshelf with his white token, and browsing through the texts. He quickly flipped through the texts on the first floor, but his joyful expression gradually disappeared.

The texts on the bookshelves were indeed exquisite, but they were all cultivation techniques and secret arts at the Golden Immortal or True Immortal level. Although there were some texts that discussed the Time Law, they were mostly superficial and didn't touch on the essence of the law.

"It seems that this is a scripture repository, and the texts here are all low-level cultivation techniques," he thought to himself, stopping his browsing and walking up the stairs to the second floor.

The second floor also had many bookshelves, but fewer than the first floor, with only around ten. The bookshelves were filled with texts and jade slips.

Time was precious, and Han Li quickly began to browse through the texts.

The texts on the second floor were slightly higher in level than those on the first floor, but they were still not very high. Most of them were Golden Immortal texts, and occasionally there would be a Taiyi Realm text, which was still not very useful to him.

Han Li quickly flipped through the texts on the second floor, but his gains were not great. He sighed and was about to leave.

The golden ring on his head, which displayed the Time Law pattern, had already faded by one-tenth. Every minute was precious.

He suddenly stopped and looked at a bookshelf next to him, which was slightly asymmetrical in its placement.

Han Li's eyebrows rose, and he pushed the bookshelf back, using his divine sense to scan the area. A look of joy appeared on his face.

He stretched out his hand and gently tapped the wall behind the bookshelf, and a small compartment opened up, revealing a small golden box.

Han Li's heart moved, and he was about to open the box, but a layer of golden light appeared on the box, blocking his hand. The box was sealed.

Han Li was taken aback, then his expression turned thoughtful. He raised his hands, and two golden lights appeared, which he used to grab the box again.

The golden light on the box interacted with the golden light on Han Li's hands, and the box's light was quickly crushed.

The box opened with a click, revealing a golden jade slip inside.

Han Li's eyes lit up, and he took the jade slip, using his divine sense to enter it.

He immediately lit up, and the jade slip contained a divine ability called "Immortal Golden Cloud".

According to the jade slip, this was a defensive divine ability based on the Time Law.

Moreover, this "Immortal Golden Cloud" was not an ordinary defensive divine ability, but the first defensive divine ability of the True Speech Sect, known as the "invincible" defense.

However, the requirements to cultivate this divine ability were extremely harsh. Firstly, one's Time Law cultivation had to be extremely strong, otherwise, one would not be able to withstand the powerful energy of the "Immortal Golden Cloud".

Secondly, one had to have a very high understanding of the Time Law, otherwise, one would not be able to comprehend the profundity of this divine ability.

Lastly, the cultivator had to have at least 300 Time Law crystals in their body to provide enough Time Law energy to activate this divine ability.

Han Li's face revealed a bitter smile. The first two requirements were not a problem for him.
The "Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique" was the most top-notch time cultivation technique, and his understanding of time laws was already very deep, so there shouldn't be any major problems, but needing 300 time law crystals was a bit of a hassle.

He currently only had 150 time law crystals in his body, barely reaching half of the "Immortal Golden Cloud" requirement, and even without the recent incident with the bottle spirit, it was still far from enough.

However, being able to find such a time divine technique, he was already quite satisfied.

He flipped his hand and put away the jade slip and golden box, then restored the wall and bookshelf to their original state, so as not to be discovered.

After doing all this, Han Li didn't linger and went downstairs, just as he was about to open the attic door to leave.

A golden light shot over from a distance, landing in front of the Cang Gong Pavilion, revealing a rough and burly man with a mid-stage Taiyi Realm cultivation.

"Friend Jiang, your Cang Gong Pavilion is still so deserted," the rough and burly man laughed.

Han Li's face changed slightly, and he quickly and secretly activated the puppet secret technique.

"I don't usually have many visitors here," the white-haired old man looked up at the burly man and said indifferently, not getting up to greet him.

"Friend Jiang, don't mind, Chen is not making fun of you, the Heavenly Court is getting more and more pressing, and my Tianxing Temple has also had very few disciples come recently. Although our achievements may be average after the thousand-year guard period, it's still better than those elders who were sent out, I've heard that many of them have already fallen," the rough and burly man said, not noticing the white-haired old man's unusual behavior.

The two of them seemed to have a fairly close relationship.

"Hmm, what brings you here, Friend Chen?" Han Li controlled the white-haired old man to ask.

"I didn't come for anything major, today the Patriarch is lecturing on the Observing Sun Peak, and I came to invite Friend Jiang to listen," the rough and burly man said.

Han Li's eyes lit up when he heard this.

The Patriarch? Could it be Miro Old Ancestor? His cultivation technique was also the "Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique", and although he might not necessarily lecture on the "Great Five Elements Illusory World Technique", his insights would definitely be related to it, and he couldn't miss this opportunity.

As soon as he thought of this, he felt a surge of excitement, but his control over the white-haired old man's movements didn't falter.

"Thank you for the invitation, Friend Chen, but I have some things to attend to, so I might be late," the white-haired old man said.

"Alright, I'll go ahead first, Friend Jiang can come as soon as he's finished with his business. Although our Patriarch's cultivation technique is different from ours, it's still good to listen to his lectures," the rough and burly man said, then bid farewell and left, turning into a golden light that shot off into the distance.

The attic door creaked open, and Han Li walked out, raised his hand, and the white-haired old man got up and walked back into the Cang Gong Pavilion.

Then he snapped his fingers, and a crystal light struck the white-haired old man's brow.

The old man's body violently shook, and he fell to the ground, entering a deep sleep.

Han Li smiled slightly, threw the white command token next to the old man, and closed the door.

He had just used the secret technique to shock the white-haired old man's divine soul, putting him into a deep sleep that would last at least four or five days, and wouldn't affect his future actions.

After doing all this, Han Li immediately flew in the direction the rough and burly man had gone, and soon arrived at a towering emerald-green mountain, with lush green trees and strange rocks, looking quite unusual.

"Here..." he looked at the mountain, and a glimmer of unusual light flashed in his eyes.

This mountain was not unfamiliar to him, and he had actually seen it three times before. The first time was when he first activated the Palm Heaven Bottle and saw Miro Old Ancestor lecture, and the location was at the peak of this mountain.

The second time was when he went to the True Speech Sect ruins, and he had passed by this mountain.

Who would have thought that he would come again today?

The emerald-green mountain towered into the clouds, and the peak couldn't be seen. A long stone staircase extended from the peak to the foot of the mountain.

At this moment, the staircase was filled with True Speech Sect disciples, all of whom were listening intently.

The lecture had already begun, and the sound of Miro Old Ancestor's voice echoed from the peak, each word like a precious pearl, giving people a sense of mystery and profundity.

The nearby heavenly energy was trembling with Miro Old Ancestor's voice, and the sky above was filled with flowing lights, sometimes turning into endless storms, sometimes turning into blazing fire rain, and sometimes turning into icy windstorms, changing endlessly.

Han Li looked at the sky, and his brow furrowed again, feeling that the scene before him was somewhat familiar, but he shook his head and flew quietly towards the mountain peak.

However, he didn't fly all the way to the peak, and instead found a place to sit down halfway up the mountain, so as not to get too close and be discovered by Miro Old Ancestor.

From here, he could already see the scene at the peak, with Miro Old Ancestor sitting in the center, surrounded by five disciples, including Qi Mozi and Mu Yan.

Next to Mu Yan was a fat and shiny old mouse, standing on its hind legs and looking at Miro Old Ancestor.
