Han Li's face was twisted in a ferocious grin, and he laughed maniacally without stopping.

Lan Yan looked at him, her eyes widening in shock at the cruel expression on his face and the aura emanating from him, which was completely different from before. It was hard to believe that this was the same person.

Ti Huo shook off the blood from her palm, her eyes becoming increasingly complex.

Lan Yan turned to Ti Huo, opening her mouth to say something.

"Quickly move away!" Ti Huo suddenly shouted, her eyes flashing with warning.

Lan Yan's face changed, and she didn't even have time to think before her body flashed to the side, moving a hundred meters away.

The moment she moved, the spot where she had been standing erupted in a massive explosion, creating a deep pit.

"After losing his mind, his cultivation aura seems to have grown stronger," Ti Huo exclaimed.

"The Corpse Severing Seal has taken effect, and he's probably being influenced by the evil corpse's divine will. His original consciousness can no longer control his body, and if this continues, it won't be him severing the corpse, but the corpse severing his original consciousness and taking over his body," Lan Yan said, her voice trembling with fear.

Ti Huo's expression turned serious. "Regardless of whether it's his consciousness or the evil corpse, we need to make him lose his mind and restrict his movements for now."

"How do we do that?" Lan Yan asked hastily.

"Help me restrict his movements for a moment, and I'll think of a way," Ti Huo replied, her hands clenched in front of her.

Just as Lan Yan was about to ask another question, a loud rumbling sound came from the deep pit, and Han Li's figure shot out of it, folding in mid-air before charging towards them at high speed.

As he approached, a powerful gust of wind pressure hit them, like a massive wall pressing down on them.

Ti Huo's eyes were closed, and her hands were forming a seal in front of her, as if preparing for a secret technique.

Lan Yan gritted her teeth and took a step forward, a blue cloth bag appearing in her palm.

With a sound like a wave crashing, the cloth bag shone brightly, and ten blue water dragons burst out of it, breaking through the wind pressure and charging towards Han Li.

Han Li let out a loud roar, his fist smashing down and colliding with two of the water dragons, causing them to explode.

The remaining eight water dragons wrapped around him, their bodies crackling with electricity as they unleashed a barrage of water blasts.

Han Li, caught in the center of the lightning, let out a pained cry, his body shrinking before expanding again.

As he did so, a dark red aura burst out of his body, and he suddenly activated his blood vessels, creating a massive shockwave that pushed back the water blasts and lightning.

"Is it done?" Lan Yan shouted, her body trembling, her face covered in blood.

Ti Huo, however, remained silent, her eyes still closed.

Just as the eight water dragons were about to collapse, Lan Yan's expression turned resolute, and she spat out a drop of blood mixed with her essence, which landed on the blue cloth bag.

The bag shone brightly, and the eight water dragons, now revitalized, opened their mouths and spat out a blue crystal ball of lightning, which shot towards Han Li.

The eight balls of lightning exploded simultaneously, creating a massive lightning pillar that shot out of the ground.

The lightning pillar struck Han Li, but he didn't fall. Instead, he looked up, his eyes blood-red, and his mouth twisted into a cruel grin.

"Finished..." Lan Yan whispered, collapsing to the ground.

Han Li's eyes locked onto her, and he let out a loud roar, his body charging towards her.

But just as he was about to attack, his eyes flashed with a strange light, and his body suddenly stopped, flipping over and crashing to the ground.

In the next instant, a figure appeared, standing in front of Han Li, a palm pressed against his forehead.

"Ti Huo..." Lan Yan's voice was barely audible as she recognized the figure.

Ti Huo stood before Han Li, her palm pressing down on his forehead, creating a wave of dark red ripples that spread out like water.

Han Li, under the pressure of her palm, sat down, motionless.

Ti Huo's eyes were blood-red, and her eyes were filled with tears of blood. The cost of using this secret technique was evident.

Her other hand moved swiftly, forming a seal, and then she pointed to her own forehead.

Her skin split open, revealing a blood-red vertical pupil.
As soon as the blood-red vertical pupils flashed, a burst of blood-colored crystal threads erupted, spreading like vines, and directly penetrated into Han Li's brow.

"Ah..."

At the moment the blood-colored crystal threads entered Han Li's brow, Ti Huo's mouth let out a mournful cry, and her eyes closed tightly.

In the next instant, Ti Huo's divine sense entered Han Li's sea of consciousness.

Upon seeing Han Li's sea of consciousness for the first time, Ti Huo discovered that it was an exceptionally vast and majestic realm.

However, this sea of consciousness was currently in a state of chaos, with violent storms raging everywhere, and countless dragon-like whirlwinds rampaging, causing the sky to be shrouded in dark clouds, with thunder rumbling incessantly.

"Boom!"

The sea of consciousness suddenly lit up, and a thick bolt of lightning descended from the sky, striking Ti Huo's divine sense.

Ti Huo hastily dodged, and rushed forward.

However, she had only flown out for a thousand feet when another violent whirlwind attacked her.

"Master, where are you?" Ti Huo called out anxiously.

If she didn't find Han Li's divine sense quickly, she, as an external invader, would be subjected to increasingly intense backlash from the sea of consciousness, and would be unable to stop Han Li when he awoke again.

Just then, Ti Huo suddenly raised her head, and saw a faint, flickering figure in the thunderclouds above.

With a surge of joy, she rushed upwards, dodging the lightning bolts, and entered the thunderclouds.

Upon reaching the top of the thunderclouds, Ti Huo found that there were no turbulent waves below, only flashes of lightning illuminating the surroundings.

Just then, a loud explosion boomed, and the thunderclouds lit up like daylight.

Ti Huo took advantage of the light to see a solitary figure in the distance, struggling to move towards a dense area of lightning.

That figure was none other than Han Li.

"Master..." Ti Huo called out, her voice echoing through the thunderous skies.

Han Li, who was stepping on the thunderclouds, his movements laborious as he headed towards the lightning-filled area, suddenly stiffened, and turned his head.

Ti Huo shuddered, and saw a face that was a mix of ferocity and solemnity.

Despite the conflicting emotions, when Han Li saw Ti Huo, his eyebrows rose in unison, and he asked, "How did you come here?"

Although he only had one mouth, two overlapping voices responded, one inquiring in surprise, and the other questioning in anger.

"This is bad, his divine sense has already begun to split!" Ti Huo exclaimed, realizing the gravity of the situation.

She was about to respond when the thunderclouds beneath her suddenly churned, and a bolt of lightning shot up, striking her.

Ti Huo dodged, and rushed towards Han Li.

A "zziila" sound echoed, as a massive lightning bolt pursued her.

Han Li saw this, and raised his right hand, dispersing the lightning with a wave.

"My divine sense has split, and the evil corpse is invading, my sea of consciousness is no longer under my control. You must quickly withdraw your divine sense, or you will be affected as well," Han Li said, his face contorting in effort.

"Hehe, you've come just in time, I'll show you how I'll devour him. You're quite good, once I occupy his sea of consciousness and physical body, you can continue to follow me," a voice said, followed by another voice.

"The Secret Art of Severing the Corpse has already taken effect, we only have one option, to temporarily seal your divine sense, and put you to sleep. Later, when we find a way, we'll awaken you," Ti Huo said, ignoring the evil corpse's words.

The evil corpse was still connected to Han Li's divine sense, and even with the Secret Art, it was impossible to deceive it. Ti Huo had no choice but to speak directly.

"Haha... this is your plan? It's exactly what I wanted," the evil corpse said. "It's useless, the evil thoughts will spread like wild grass, the longer it takes, the more severe the invasion of your main consciousness will be. Even if we both fall into a deep sleep, it won't make a difference. By the time we awaken again, my main consciousness will have already disappeared."

Ti Huo was taken aback, and fell into a dilemma.

"I've reached an agreement with him, to use lightning to separate our divine senses, and then we'll rely on our own abilities to see who can eliminate the other," Han Li said, a determined look on his face.

"This won't work, you're still far from the peak of the early stage of the Great Luo. Forcing the elimination of the corpse now will only end in failure..." Ti Huo said anxiously.

"This is the only option left, and this guy is getting impatient, wanting to come out immediately," Han Li said helplessly.

"Stop talking, if you interfere again, I'll kill you first," the evil corpse said, its voice venomous.

"Since this is your choice, Master, I won't say anything more. I'll continue to follow you, no matter what happens... even if you become the evil corpse's body," Ti Huo said, sighing.

"Since you're so cooperative, I'll give you a chance to see how I'll eliminate the main soul, and become your master... haha..." the evil corpse said, its voice dripping with confidence.

Ti Huo didn't say anything more, and simply stood aside, watching Han Li's divine sense walk towards the lightning-filled area.
