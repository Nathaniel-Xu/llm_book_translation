Didn't the Li Huo Tian Zhu fall into Han Li's hands? Could it be that someone intercepted it halfway and stole it?" Xiong Shan's face revealed a look of surprise upon hearing this.

 Qi Mozi didn't say a word, his mouth muttering to himself as he raised his hand and waved it.

A golden light flashed in his palm, and a small golden mirror the size of a palm appeared, emitting a wave of golden light that spread out in all directions, rapidly fluctuating within a radius of several dozen li before returning to the mirror's surface.

The golden mirror flashed, and three strands of light appeared: gold, white, and red.

The golden light emitted waves of time law fluctuations, while the white and red lights both emitted flames of law. Especially the red light, which was smaller than the white light but emitted stronger law fluctuations, suppressing the white light's law power.

"Ah, this flame law is quite extraordinary, able to surpass the flame law within the Li Huo Tian Zhu." Xiong Shan wasn't surprised by the scene before him, clearly not the first time he had seen it.

"Of course it's extraordinary, this strand of flame law is the legendary flame origin law, how could it be suppressed by the Li Huo Tian Zhu?" Qi Mozi said slowly.

"Flame origin law! This is surprising, but who could have left this strand of origin law? Among the people who entered the Sui Yue Tower, it seems no one cultivates flame law." Xiong Shan's expression changed, and he said.

Qi Mozi's face sank upon hearing this.

The reason for his heavy expression was precisely because of this.

In the world, there were countless laws, with the three great supreme laws being the most revered, but origin laws were not ordinary either, ranking just below the three great supreme laws. Very few people could comprehend them.

Qi Mozi knew that among the people who entered the Sui Yue Tower, no one cultivated flame law. Now, a person who cultivated flame origin law had suddenly appeared, leaving him shocked and secretly guessing whether someone else had entered the tower apart from Han Li and the others.

"Never mind, it's pointless to think too much. Let's just follow and see." Qi Mozi shook his head and said.

Xiong Shan naturally wouldn't object to this, and the two of them transformed into two golden lights, flying upwards.

â€¦

At this time, Han Li was leading the Jing Yan Tongzi, continuing to fly upwards.

The higher they went, the thicker the white mist became, and it gradually became more substantial, like silk threads wrapping around Han Li's flying light, greatly reducing his speed.

Moreover, the higher they went, the thicker the white mist became, and the obstructions increased, his flying speed quickly dropping to only 10% of his usual speed.

Suddenly, Han Li's expression changed, and he stopped his flying light, looking towards the front with a contemplative expression.

The Jing Yan Tongzi looked at Han Li, opening and closing his mouth several times, then using his small hands to gesture, seemingly asking Han Li why he had stopped.

Han Li didn't respond to the Jing Yan Tongzi, only looking towards the front.

At this point, he could clearly sense a powerful time law fluctuation ahead, no longer as unclear as before.

This time law fluctuation was similar to the golden flame aura he had seen at the two array eyes, and should be of the same origin.

If he wasn't mistaken, the source of this time law fluctuation should be the Sui Yue Shen Deng.

Han Li had previously asked Lei Yu Ce about the Black Heaven Demon God's seal, and the five array eyes were only auxiliary, the Black Heaven Demon God being sealed within a main array. The Sui Yue Shen Deng was also within that main array.

Now that the Sui Yue Shen Deng had revealed a hint of its presence, the Black Heaven Demon God's seal should be nearby.

Han Li wasn't as afraid of the Black Heaven Demon God as Lei Yu Ce and the others, but he still didn't want to confront this possible Dao Ancestor existence head-on.

Since entering the Tai Sui Tower, he had first obtained three fire age silkworm nests, greatly increasing the number of time law crystals. Just now, he had also obtained the white fire pearl containing the flame origin law, his harvest already considerable.

If he continued forward, it would mean taking a risk at the Black Heaven Demon God's seal, increasing the danger.

Just then, a loud muffled sound came from somewhere, and the nearby white misty sea fluctuated.

"What's going on?" Han Li's eyebrows rose.

The Jing Yan Tongzi's body suddenly lit up with a white light, and the white fire pearl flew out of his body, its light bursting forth and vibrating intensely, as if resonating with something.

However, this situation didn't last long, and after a few breaths, the white light on the fire pearl quickly dimmed, returning to its original state.

The Jing Yan Tongzi saw this and quickly opened his mouth to absorb the fire pearl back into his body, then used his small hands to tightly hug his belly, looking like he was afraid it would fly out again.

"Could it be that the other two array eyes were broken, causing this white fire pearl to react?" Han Li saw this and smiled slightly, stroking the Jing Yan Tongzi's head as he secretly guessed.

The five array eyes were connected, and the white fire pearl was the pressuring object of one of the array eyes, so it was normal for it to have a connection with the other two array eyes.

He pondered for a moment, then quickly stopped thinking, his gaze looking towards the front.

This brief delay had already made him decide to continue forward, seeing the situation before deciding what to do.

After all, he had already come this far, and retreating midway would be a waste, he was still curious about the Sui Yue Shen Deng and wanted to see it.

Moreover, he had previously agreed with Huo San and the others to join forces, and now leaving without warning would be a breach of their agreement.

With this thought, Han Li didn't hesitate, shouting lightly as a giant golden sword shadow appeared on his body, enveloping him as he flew forward.
The sword shadow was surrounded by a golden electric arc, emitting a fierce and unparalleled sword energy that instantly cut through the fog in front of it, increasing its speed.

However, the good fortune was short-lived, as the white fog around it grew thicker and more resilient after advancing a short distance.

The golden sword shadow found it increasingly difficult to break through the fog, and its speed slowed down again.

Jing Yan Tongzi's eyes narrowed as he saw this scene, and he flew out from Han Li's shoulder, opening his mouth to spit out a white fireball.

The white fireball merged with the golden sword shadow around Han Li, and a few strands of white flames shot out from the fireball, wrapping around the sword shadow and interacting with the golden electric arc.

The sword shadow's speed suddenly increased, and it cut through the fog in front of it with a force like a broken bamboo.

"The road ahead is uncertain, don't waste your energy to activate the fireball, conserve your strength." Han Li frowned and said in a low voice.

Jing Yan Tongzi smiled and seemed to say it was okay.

Han Li carefully sensed the changes in Jing Yan Tongzi's aura, and found that the consumption was not great, and he was surprised and delighted, and quickly accelerated the sword light to move forward.

After flying for a while, the white fog in front of them suddenly began to thin out, and it seemed to have reached the end.

The mountain peaks below were no longer endless, and they could vaguely see the overall shape, and it seemed that they had finally reached the mountain top area.

Han Li was secretly delighted and accelerated again.

But the next moment, a loud "Boom" sound came, and he crashed into something hard, the golden sword shadow around him shattered, and he was shocked and flew back.

Fortunately, Han Li's physical body was extremely resilient, and he was not injured.

The white fireball inside the sword shadow was also shaken back, and Jing Yan Tongzi quickly swallowed it into his body.

"What's going on?" Han Li's body straightened up, and he looked forward, his face changing.

Only to see a layer of white light screen appearing in front of the fog, which didn't seem to be very thick, and inside, he could vaguely see white light flowing and flashing.

But this light screen was semi-transparent, and it was mixed with the fog, making it difficult to discover.

The light screen seemed to be endless, and Han Li's divine sense couldn't sense its full shape, and couldn't penetrate it, as if it was a heavenly moat blocking his way.

And in the depths of the white light screen, he could vaguely see a dazzling golden light, and waves of time law fluctuations were emanating from it.

"That's..." Han Li's eyes lit up, and he flew over to the white light screen, trying his best to see the situation behind the golden light.

Unfortunately, the golden light was too dazzling, and the light screen blocked his view, and he couldn't see the situation inside, but he could be sure that it was the sealed area of the Black Heaven Demon God.

Han Li withdrew his gaze, and his eyes fell on the white light screen in front of him, and he reached out to press it.

The white light screen was slightly soft to the touch, but it was extremely hard and unbreakable, giving him a sense of being indestructible.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and then he let out a low growl, and his body's over 900 acupuncture points burst out with light, and then he punched the light screen with all his might.

A loud "Boom" sound echoed!

His fist sank deeply into the white light screen, and the light screen around his fist showed a wave-like fluctuation, and the surrounding air shook with a loud rumble.

But the white light screen didn't show any signs of shattering, and instead, it emitted a powerful backlash, shaking him back.

Han Li flew back over 200-300 feet, and his body's golden light flashed, and he stopped again.

This time, the backlash was too strong, and it twisted his five organs and six viscera into a knot, and even with his physical body's resilience, he was somewhat unable to withstand it, and his face turned white, and it took a while for him to recover.

Han Li's face sank, and he coldly snorted, and his two hands formed a seal, and he activated the "Tian Sha Zhen Yu Gong".

The next moment, his body burst out with starlight, and his shape suddenly expanded, transforming into a giant demon with three heads and six arms.

The three heads were a mountain giant ape, a true spirit heavenly dragon, and a heavenly whale.

The three true spirit bloodline powers surged out from his body, and a powerful and overwhelming aura burst out from him, and the surrounding air shook.

The white light screen behind him suddenly fluctuated, but the next moment, it returned to its original state.

Han Li only focused on activating the "Tian Sha Zhen Yu Gong", and didn't notice the light screen's situation, and the giant demon let out a roar, and its six fists struck the white light screen with all its might.

A loud "Boom" sound echoed!

The six fists struck the light screen, and it sank deeply into the light screen, and the light screen around it shook violently, and the fluctuations were ten times stronger than before.

But even so, the white light screen remained taut and unbroken, and it emitted a dazzling light, and the white light inside it rotated rapidly, and a powerful and flexible restrictive force emanated from it, slowly dispelling the giant demon's unparalleled strength.
