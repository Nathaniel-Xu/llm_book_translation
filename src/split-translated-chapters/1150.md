Milo Laozu's speed was far beyond Han Li's, and he flew over tens of millions of miles in a short time.

However, the golden space was enormous, and there was no sign of reaching the end.

After flying for an unknown amount of time, Milo Laozu suddenly moved and descended, landing in front of a golden giant peak.

The golden giant peak was majestic and towering, reaching into the clouds and covering half of the sky, like a golden giant beast standing proudly.

The entire peak emitted waves of golden light, and each stone emitted fluctuations of the time law, gathering together to form a boundless and overwhelming flow of law, filling the entire area.

Han Li followed Milo Laozu down and had not even stood firm when he felt an indescribable force of law pressing down on him.

He stumbled backward, taking two steps before stabilizing his body, and looked at the golden giant peak in shock, taking a deep breath.

"These golden stones... are all Xu Mi Xuan Star Stones!"

He had cultivated the time law, and was familiar with various materials containing the power of time law. The golden giant peak before him was entirely composed of a material called Xu Mi Xuan Star Stone.

Xu Mi Xuan Star Stone was a very rare material for the time law, said to be produced in the endless starry sky outside the Nine Heavens. A small piece could be sold for a high price, and the giant peak before him was entirely composed of Xu Mi Xuan Star Stone. If he had not seen it with his own eyes, he would have found it hard to believe.

"This Xu Mi Golden Mountain is the center of the True Words Mystic Realm, and was brought back by the eleventh generation leader of the True Words Sect, Tian Shi Zhen Ren, from the Nine Heavens outer domain." Milo Laozu slowly opened his mouth.

"The True Words Sect's foundation is indeed deep and unfathomable, worthy of being an existence that can rival the Heavenly Court." Han Li let out a sigh, and once again sincerely praised.

The flow of time here was even faster, reaching hundreds of times that of the outside world.

He did not know how the True Words Sect had achieved this, but if he could also master this technique, wouldn't it be equivalent to having hundreds of times more time to cultivate?

Thinking of this, Han Li's heart was stirred.

"Brother Han, you flatter me too much, follow me." Milo Laozu smiled and stepped forward.

There were not many buildings around the golden giant peak, only a large palace at the foot of the mountain, also made of Xu Mi Xuan Star Stone, shining with golden light, and looking exceptionally majestic. However, there was no sign or plaque at the entrance, and he did not know what was inside.

The palace gates were closed, with a "卍" symbol on either side.

Milo Laozu came to the palace gates, and a layer of golden light appeared on his thick palm. He pressed it against the "卍" symbols.

The palace gates suddenly burst forth with a surge of golden light, and four golden divine shadows emerged from the light.

The first divine shadow was a tall and sturdy man in golden armor, with a square face, holding a giant axe in one hand and a giant shield in the other. He looked full of endless majesty.

The second divine shadow had a golden beak on its mouth, with eight golden wings on its back, and a golden crystal crown on its head. It was peculiar that it had three feet, like a tripod.

The third divine shadow was a small girl with two short wings on her back, and a shining light halo on her head. She was chubby and looked adorable.

The little girl held a small golden bow and arrow in her hand, with a heart-shaped arrowhead. It looked like a child's toy.

The fourth divine shadow was a beautiful woman with six arms, each holding a different musical instrument, including a guqin, a bell, a sheng, a pipa, a bell, and a drum. With a slight movement, she produced a beautiful and pleasant sound.

As soon as the four divine shadows appeared, they looked at Milo Laozu, their faces filled with vigilance and a killing intent.

Milo Laozu muttered to himself, and countless golden symbols flew out of his mouth, merging into the four divine shadows.

The four divine shadows' eyes slowly lost their hostility, and they flew to either side, standing on either side of the palace gates. The gates slowly creaked open.

"Let's go." Milo Laozu made a gesture to Han Li, and stepped forward into the palace.

Han Li did not hesitate, and followed behind.

The first thing he saw inside the palace was a vast hall, hundreds of feet in size. The floor in the center of the hall was engraved with dense, intricate golden patterns, including images of the sun, moon, and stars, forming a complex and grand array.

Bright golden light and golden symbols burst forth from the array, and it was peculiar that all the light and symbols were confined within the array, without spreading out, only swirling and flashing within the array.

Next to the grand golden array stood two stone pillars, one white and one gold.

The golden stone pillar was also made of Xu Mi Xuan Star Stone, and was connected to the ground without any gaps. It was engraved with flame-like golden patterns.
On the white stone pillar were also inscribed patterns, but they were silver in color. At the top of the pillar was a black hole, and faintly visible black light flickered within.

A stream of immortal stones flew out of the hole, forming a torrent of immortal stones that poured into the golden array, instantly dissolving into pure immortal spirit energy that merged into the array.

At the same time, a golden pillar emitted waves of flame-like golden light, each containing the dense power of the time laws. These also merged into the golden array.

Under the stimulation of the vast immortal spirit energy and the power of time, the grand golden array began to operate, emitting golden orbs the size of human heads that flew out of the array, containing countless golden talismans that emitted intense time law fluctuations, flying towards the high places.

Above the golden array, a golden disk floated, inscribed with patterns, and at its center was a thumb-sized protrusion with a golden pointer inserted.

The golden orbs merged into the disk, and the golden pointer spun rapidly.

Waves of golden light emanated from the disk, merging into the surrounding void.

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise as he beheld the scene.

He was surprised for two reasons: first, he discovered that the source of the accelerated time flow within the True Speech Mystic Realm was the grand golden array before him.

More accurately, it was the golden disk above the array.

Han Li's second reason for surprise was that the golden disk was the same one he had obtained from the True Speech Sect's ancient ruins.

"Han, you must have noticed that the time flow within the True Speech Mystic Realm is different from the outside world. The source of this is the golden disk, which possesses the divine power to change the time flow. One day outside is equivalent to a month or even a year within the realm. It is because of this disk that our True Speech Sect has become so powerful," said Mi Luo Old Ancestor, his eyes shining with bright light.

Han Li glanced at Mi Luo Old Ancestor, his heart filled with admiration.

With this time difference, one's cultivation speed would be dozens or even hundreds of times faster than others. It was no wonder that the True Speech Sect had become so powerful.

"This golden disk is indeed extraordinary, but it seems that activating it requires the consumption of vast amounts of immortal stones and time laws. And this array looks very unusual," Han Li said, his gaze falling on the golden and white stone pillars beside the array.

Mi Luo Old Ancestor smiled. "This array is called the Light-Time Heavenly Array, one of the ten ancient arrays. Only this array can activate the golden disk. As for the consumption, immortal stones are not a problem, but the time laws are the real challenge. Fortunately, our sect has the Mustard Seed Golden Mountain, which contains almost infinite time laws, allowing us to sustain the activation of the golden disk."

Han Li's heart sank as he listened.

Creating such a time difference space required such a massive consumption of resources, even the True Speech Sect's power was stretched to its limits. As for him, it was even more hopeless.

Even if the golden disk were in his possession, it would be a distant hope.

"The consumption of activating the golden disk varies from person to person. The True Speech Mystic Realm is too vast, and changing the time flow for the entire realm is a massive undertaking. However, if one only wants to change the time flow for a small space, the consumption would be much smaller," Mi Luo Old Ancestor said, his eyes glinting with a hint of meaning.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he heard this.

Mi Luo Old Ancestor's words seemed to carry a hidden meaning, as if he had discovered that the golden disk would eventually fall into Han Li's hands.

"The golden disk is just the beginning. Let's go, I'll take you to the deeper part of the hall," Mi Luo Old Ancestor said, walking towards the depths of the hall.

Han Li followed, his brow furrowed in thought.

As they passed through the hall, they came to a long corridor, and ahead of them, two paths diverged.

The right path emitted dazzling light, and powerful law fluctuations emanated from it, as if it contained powerful immortal artifacts, including time artifacts.

The left path was much quieter, with no unusual phenomena.

"The right path is our True Speech Sect's treasure hall, where many immortal artifacts are stored. Let's go to the left path, which leads to the cultivation hall, where our sect's cultivation methods and divine techniques are stored," Mi Luo Old Ancestor explained, leading Han Li towards the left path.

They soon arrived at another golden hall, several hundred feet long and shaped like a rectangle, with a height of only a few dozen feet.

The walls of the hall were lined with empty grid cells, each containing a book or a jade slip, covered by a golden light screen.

Each grid cell had a metal plaque beside it, inscribed with golden characters that marked the contents of the book or jade slip.

"The Day and Night Qiankun Cultivation Method", "The Four Seasons Mystic Light Spectra", "The Wujing Tianyin Divine Technique", "The True Speech Great Hand Seal", "The Extinguishing Time Divine Light"...
