Han Li's face turned pale, his eyes wide with shock and anger. He spat out a mouthful of blood as he stumbled backward, his body trembling with fear.

The five Time Law treasures, which had been his most precious possessions, had been shattered into pieces. The True Speech Treasure Wheel, the Light Purification Vessel, the Phantom Hourglass, the Time Severing Torch, and the Dong Yi Divine Tree â€“ all of them had been destroyed.

Han Li's face was ashen, his eyes filled with despair. He had never imagined that the Chaos God Thunder would be so powerful. He had thought that with his Time Law treasures, he could withstand the attack, but now...

The Chaos God Thunder continued to bombard Han Li, its power unrelenting. The gold vortex that had protected him earlier had been destroyed, and his body was now exposed to the full force of the attack.

Han Li's body was engulfed in a sea of chaotic energy, his life force dwindling rapidly. He knew that he couldn't withstand this attack for much longer.

Suddenly, a figure appeared beside him. It was the Wheel of Rebirth Master, who had been watching the battle from a distance.

"Quickly, retreat!" the Wheel of Rebirth Master shouted, his voice filled with urgency. "We can't withstand this attack!"

Han Li didn't need to be told twice. He turned and fled, the Wheel of Rebirth Master following close behind.

As they retreated, the Chaos God Thunder continued to bombard the area, its power unrelenting. The two of them knew that they had to get as far away from the attack as possible if they wanted to survive.

The Wheel of Rebirth Master turned to Han Li and said, "We need to find a way to counter this attack. If we can't, we'll be destroyed."

Han Li nodded, his mind racing with ideas. He knew that he had to think of something, and fast, if he wanted to survive this attack.

The two of them continued to retreat, their eyes fixed on the Chaos God Thunder as it continued to bombard the area. They knew that they had to come up with a plan, and fast, if they wanted to survive this attack.
A wave of destructive power permeated the air, invading Han Li's body.

Han Li's body shook violently, his meridians trembling intensely, even in his current Tianxia Demon God form, he was barely able to withstand it.

He was shocked awake, not daring to think too much, and fully activated the remaining Time Law within his body, as well as the Tianxia Prison Technique.

A burst of dark energy exploded from his body, a massive force that immediately expelled the invasive destructive power.

At this moment, the Golden Clouds surrounding Han Li finally could not withstand the power of the Chaos Thunder, and they all collapsed, with a massive amount of thunderbolts descending upon him.

Han Li let out a low shout, his 36 arms waving in unison, striking upwards.

36 golden fist silhouettes exploded forth, containing a power that could punch a hole through the heavens, but upon colliding with the Chaos Thunder, they were like stones sinking into the sea, without even a ripple.

A massive amount of Chaos Thunder descended upon Han Li.

Han Li's 36 arms all exploded, turning into a bloody rain, his scales flying everywhere, his body blown open, revealing his dark black bones.

If not for the fact that these bones contained the strongest power of the Tianxia Demon God, and that he had used the last of his Time Law to protect them, these bones would have been shattered.

Han Li's broken body was blown away, his body reforming into human shape.

The Chaos Thunder dispersed quickly.

The Six Paths Reincarnation Disk still stood, its surface cracked, its dark red glow dimmed.

Behind the disk, a figure floated, its body bursting open.

The Reincarnation Palace Master emerged, his face pale, having clearly suffered greatly from resisting the Chaos Thunder.

He turned to look around, his expression sinking.

The demon lord's hiding place had disappeared, a broken and fragmented corpse floating nearby, its aura gone, it was indeed the demon lord's.

And on the other side, Han Li's situation was slightly better, but he was still on the brink of death.

"Hahahaha, how's the taste of the Chaos Thunder? Now that your two helpers are gone, you're the only one left, still wanting to seek revenge?" Guo or Jin laughed loudly, his face full of triumph.

A wave of Chaos energy flowed into his body, his face fully restored, his aura even more powerful.

"The Chaos Thunder is indeed formidable, but it's not the end yet, who will die and who will live, is still unknown!" The Reincarnation Palace Master sneered, his body suddenly flying backwards, as he spat out a dark red energy ball.

The energy ball contained dozens of dark red threads, which were the threads of the Reincarnation Law, merging into the Six Paths Reincarnation Disk.

The disk began to spin rapidly, as if it had received a boost.

A massive attractive force emerged, pulling the demon lord's corpse and Han Li's body towards the disk.

The disk's black light flashed, six black holes appeared, one of which enlarged, swallowing the demon lord's corpse.

The Reincarnation Palace Master's fingers moved swiftly, as he controlled the disk, which spun and danced, emitting a dazzling dark red glow, which permeated the void.

Guo or Jin's eyebrows furrowed.

"Out!" The Reincarnation Palace Master stopped his hand seals, and clapped his hands.

The disk's other hole flashed, and a figure emerged, it was the demon lord.

He was now fully restored, his eyes shining with life, and he was alive again.

The demon lord looked around, his expression shocked and confused.

"Revival!" Guo or Jin's pupils constricted.

"Thank you, Palace Master." The demon lord bowed, having understood the situation.

"Stone friend, no need to be polite, the Reincarnation Law can revive you, but it will also consume one of your reincarnations, do not use it too much." The Reincarnation Palace Master shook his head, looking at Han Li's body, about to heal him.

"Ah!" He suddenly stopped, his face changing.

At this moment, Han Li's body floated in mid-air, his aura almost gone.

His remaining Time Law had been blown away, dispersing into the void, his body empty and hollow.

Han Li's body felt no pain, his senses fading away.

"Will I die here?"

Han Li's mind flashed with this thought, but he felt no fear.

Instead, he felt a sense of unity with the world, as if he had become one with it.

Everything around him slowed down, the fluctuations of the qi, the rolling of the lights, everything became extremely slow, clear, and present.

He could no longer see, but he was perceiving the world in a different way...
