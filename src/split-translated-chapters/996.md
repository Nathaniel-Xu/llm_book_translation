The moonlit city, a wide and bustling main street in the city center, branched off into a narrow alleyway.

The alleyway was secluded, with no one in sight, and at the end of it stood a weathered stone wall, covered in the marks of time.

As the sun set, the fading light of the evening sun cast an orange glow on the wall.

At this moment, the space behind the wall rippled, and a figure clad in a blue robe suddenly appeared, revealing Han Li.

As soon as he entered the alley, he turned his wrist and pulled out a mask from the Wheel of Rebirth, putting it on his face. A wave of light rippled out, and he transformed into a young demon with a short horn on his forehead, walking towards the entrance of the alley.

As he exited the alley, he saw a giant banyan tree with lush branches and leaves, its canopy stretching out like an umbrella, and seven or eight people gathered under the tree, chatting idly.

Han Li had not yet approached when he heard a loud-voiced black-clad man say, "I think the Third Prince is doing a good job ruling. In the past, if you wanted to visit the Mahayana district, you had to go through repeated identity checks, but now it's much more convenient for both merchants and cultivators."

"I disagree," said an elderly man with a thin build, "When the First Prince was in power, the law and order in the Raksha district, Mahayana district, and even our own Black Heaven district were all much better. Look at the situation now, street fights break out every few days, and when they do, it's not just the people involved who get hurt, but also the innocent bystanders."

"If only the two princes could work together and rule jointly..." said a young demon boy, leaning against the elderly man, "that would be perfect."

The others laughed at this suggestion.

"I'm a traveler from outside the city," Han Li said, walking up to the group and bowing, "Could you tell me where I am?"

"Ah, you're from outside the city?" said the middle-aged man, looking at Han Li with curiosity, "We're in the southernmost part of the Black Heaven district. Where are you headed?"

"I'm going to the Mahayana district to visit a senior member of my clan," Han Li said, feigning ignorance, "I thought I was almost there, but it seems I'm still in the Black Heaven district. This city is really big..."

The elderly man smiled and said, "You're new here, aren't you? Hurry up and rent a carriage at the market ahead, or you'll be walking for who-knows-how-long to get to the Mahayana district."

Han Li nodded, but didn't leave, instead asking, "I overheard your conversation earlier, and I'm a bit confused. Isn't the Holy Ruler in power?"

The middle-aged man laughed and said, "You're from a remote village, aren't you? News travels slowly there, I suppose. The Holy Ruler has been in seclusion for 500 years, and now the Third Prince is in power."

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise, and he asked, "But wasn't the First Prince in power before?"

The elderly man chuckled and said, "The First Prince has been missing for over a thousand years. Some say he's in seclusion, others say he's traveling, and some say he's been imprisoned by the Holy Ruler. There are all sorts of rumors, but no one knows the truth."

Han Li thanked them and left, walking along the main street towards the market.

...

Several days later, on a moonless night.

In the northern part of the imperial city, a series of connected palaces were brightly lit, with demon guards patrolling the grounds, their spears at the ready.

In the shadows of the palace walls, a figure clad in black was moving swiftly, dodging between the buildings with ease. It was Han Li, his aura suppressed, relying solely on his physical strength to move undetected.

As he moved, he noticed that the palace's defensive arrays were like an open book to him, and he avoided them with ease.

Before long, he arrived at a beautiful, isolated palace.

Without approaching the door, Han Li wrinkled his nose, sensing the strong scent of medicinal herbs. He noticed that the windows were all closed, and a faint mist was rising from the roof.

After a brief examination, he pressed his hand against the door's lock, and a burst of silver light flashed out, destroying the hidden symbols and disabling the lock.

Han Li pushed open the door and slipped inside, his figure flashing into the palace.

As he entered, he was met with a sudden gust of wind, and he dodged to the side, his fists flying forward, striking the two figures that had been hiding in ambush.

The two figures crashed to the ground, their bodies limp and lifeless.

Han Li had not intended to kill them, so he had struck them with precision, hitting their vital points and rendering them unconscious.
"If not to kill, then it's to seek something...‚Äù A hoarse voice sounded, accompanied by the splashing of water.

Han Li didn't immediately respond, instead gazing forward.

In the center of the palace, a large water pool resembling a heavenly well was filled with a dark, viscous liquid that seemed to be slowly churning. The misty vapor emanating from it was rising into the air.

From within the pool, a stout figure slowly emerged, its body covered in a massive black cloak that obscured its head and body, making its face impossible to discern.

"Is the friend's surname Li?" the person asked, seeing Han Li's silence.

The stout figure slowly walked out of the pool, its body seemingly surrounded by flames as it radiated intense heat, quickly drying the black cloak.

Han Li's heart stirred slightly at the mention of his surname, but he didn't confirm or deny it, instead asking, "Is the friend the Grand Priest?"

"How can it be that Friend Li has come all this way, yet still can't determine if I'm the one he's looking for?" the Grand Priest asked.

"The Grand Priest is known for being reclusive and secretive, so it's unusual that he's so unguarded today. That's why I'm a bit uncertain," Han Li replied, his brow furrowed.

"Being within the heavily guarded palace, with two Taichi initial-stage cultivators serving as bodyguards, doesn't count as being heavily guarded? Ha ha, I think Friend Li is just too skilled," the stout man chuckled.

"Time is short, so I won't engage in wordplay with you. Since you're the Grand Priest, you should know what I'm seeking," Han Li asked, his expression unchanging.

"I've known for over a thousand years, but unfortunately, I'm unable to fulfill your request," the Grand Priest sighed.

"Unable to fulfill... if that's the case, then I'll just have to take your head and go see the real Grand Priest," Han Li sneered.

"It seems Friend Li still doesn't believe me. I am the Grand Priest," the hoarse voice replied, sounding somewhat helpless.

"You're the Grand Priest, yet you haven't even looked at me. How can you be sure you can't help me?" Han Li asked sternly.

"Over a thousand years ago, I cast a divination, and the results showed that the matter is impossible," the Grand Priest explained.

"Impossible doesn't mean it can't be done. Why must you say you can't do it?" Han Li sneered.

"Knowing that something is impossible yet still attempting to do it is a great taboo," the Grand Priest shook his head.

"It's been over a thousand years since then. Why not cast another divination? Perhaps the situation has changed," Han Li suggested, suppressing the turmoil in his heart.

The Grand Priest was taken aback by Han Li's words, then smiled and said, "If that's the case, I'll cast another divination. If the results still show that it's impossible, will Friend Li not force me to do something I'm unwilling to do?"

Han Li didn't respond.

The Grand Priest saw Han Li's expression and shook his head, then rubbed his hands together and produced five silver coins, which he tossed into the air. His other hand swiftly reached out, palm up, and caught the coins.

The five coins were arranged in a plum blossom pattern in his palm, with two or three of them showing their reverse side.

The Grand Priest manipulated the coins for a moment, then suddenly changed expression, his brow furrowed as he exclaimed, "You're an extraordinary person! Why is your fate so chaotic?"

"Grand Priest, it seems you've calculated something you shouldn't have," Han Li's voice turned cold.

As soon as he spoke, the surrounding air was filled with flashing lights, and nine Cloud-Drifting Swords shot out, cutting through the space around them and pointing at the Grand Priest.

The Grand Priest's eyes flashed with a strange light, as if he had suddenly remembered something, and he asked, "Friend Li, are you surnamed Han?"

"It seems you're truly seeking death..." Han Li's expression remained unchanged as he spoke.

"I think that, as a fellow member of the Wheel of Reincarnation Temple, Friend Li wouldn't do such a thing," the Grand Priest said, his voice hoarse as he laughed.

He slowly raised his arm, and a pale, bloodless hand emerged from his sleeve, holding a round, palm-sized token with the words "Wheel of Reincarnation Token" engraved on it.

Han Li's gaze changed slightly, and his heart was filled with doubt.

"Did you learn of my identity through the Wheel of Reincarnation Temple's internal news?" Han Li asked, his Cloud-Drifting Swords still unsheathed.

"That's not important... what's important is that the matter you're seeking can be accomplished today," the Grand Priest said, shaking his head.

Han Li didn't respond, instead raising his hand to summon a silver light door that floated in the air, revealing a small room inside.

"This... could it be the legendary Cavern of the Heavens treasure?" the Grand Priest asked, surprised.

"Not bad, Grand Priest. Please wait..." Han Li nodded and said.

He stepped into the room, lifted the wailing spirit, and turned to return to the palace.
