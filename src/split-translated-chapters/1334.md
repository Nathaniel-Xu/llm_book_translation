“……I found out you were captured by Feng Qing Shui, so I rushed to the Dragon Abyss Realm and had a great battle with Feng Qing Shui and Chen Ru Yan, two great ancestors of the Dao. With the protection of heaven, I finally brought you back safely.” Han Li said, recounting the events up to this point.

“I had imagined countless times what kind of situation you would encounter after ascending to the heavens, but now it seems that it was not enough to prepare for the countless unexpected events. In this situation, ordinary people would have died countless times, but only you could turn danger into safety time and time again.” Nan Gong Wan's eyes reflected Han Li's image, and she let out a sigh, saying with a hint of admiration.

“Don't praise me, it's just a matter of luck and coincidence, and a bit of good fortune that allowed me to make it this far.” Han Li shook his head and smiled.

“There are also many powerful beauties who have helped you, right? I heard from Gan Jiu Zhen that Ti Hu and Jin Tong have both transformed into beautiful women, and there's also your beloved, Zi Ling.” Nan Gong Wan said with a hint of a smile.

“Wan'er, don't tease me, Ti Hu is someone I've known since the mortal realm, and she's been by my side through thick and thin. As for Jin Tong, she was originally a Gold-Devouring Immortal that I had cultivated, and I didn't expect her to have such a complicated past... As for Zi Ling, she had a past entanglement with me...” Han Li smiled wryly, explaining to Nan Gong Wan.

When he mentioned Zi Ling, his face turned slightly awkward, and he was about to say something, but Nan Gong Wan stopped him with her fingers.

“Husband, at this point, I wouldn't be jealous of these things. It's all just fate and coincidence, and the heavens have their own arrangements, just like our own past.” Nan Gong Wan shook her head and said softly.

“Wan'er, you've been talking about me all this time, but what about you? How have you been in the lower realm these past few years?” Han Li nodded silently, changing the subject and asking.

“These past few years in the lower realm have been relatively simple, not as exciting as your adventures, husband. After you ascended, I closed myself off in the Qing Yun Palace and cultivated diligently, relying on the resources you left behind and some fortunate encounters. I eventually reached the Great Ascension stage, and after preparing for a while, I attempted to transcend the heavenly tribulation to meet you in the True Immortal Realm.” Nan Gong Wan smoothed out her hair and said calmly.

“How was your heavenly tribulation?” Han Li's eyebrows twitched, asking.

“I originally thought that with my preparations, I could overcome the heavenly tribulation, but I underestimated its power... After withstanding several tribulations, I eventually exhausted my energy and was struck by the final tribulation, falling into endless darkness... In my final moments, I called out to the heavens, hoping you could hear my last words.” Nan Gong Wan said with a bitter smile.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he heard this, and he couldn't help but reach out to gently stroke Nan Gong Wan's cheek.

“I thought I was dead for sure, but I woke up in a dimly lit world, and my internal energy had transformed into immortal energy. The people around me were all stronger than Ma Liang, and they were all true immortals.” Nan Gong Wan placed her hand on Han Li's, saying.

“Dimly lit world? Could it be the Underworld?” Han Li's eyes flashed.

“Yes, it was the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation who saved me, but he quickly sealed my memories, and my consciousness fell into a deep slumber, only awakening recently.” Nan Gong Wan nodded, continuing.

“These past few years, I wasn't by your side, and you had to face all this alone. I'm sorry. But why did you leave the Wheel of Reincarnation later on?” Han Li held Nan Gong Wan's hand, asking.

“The Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation treated me with respect, and even allowed me to do as I pleased, but my intuition told me to keep my distance from him, and I also wanted to see you, so I snuck away from that place. Now that I think about it, I've caused you trouble.” Nan Gong Wan lowered her head, feeling guilty.

“How could you cause trouble? It's just a temporary measure, and I wouldn't have been at ease if you had stayed in the Wheel of Reincarnation. If you hadn't escaped, we might not have been able to meet again.” Han Li smiled.

Nan Gong Wan smiled back, and her hands grasped Han Li's.

“Speaking of which, how is the situation in the Spirit Realm? What about the people in the Qing Yuan Palace? Are they all doing well?” Han Li asked.

“With the foundation you left behind, the human tribe is thriving, and the people in the Qing Yuan Palace are all cultivating smoothly. When I transcended the heavenly tribulation, Qi Ling Zi and Hai Da Shao had already reached the peak of the merged stage, and were only one step away from the Great Ascension stage. Bai Guo Er had an even better talent, and had already reached the Great Ascension stage. Bing Feng and Yin Yue had also reached the Great Ascension stage earlier than me, but they were still accumulating strength to overcome the heavenly tribulation.” Nan Gong Wan's eyes flashed with a hint of color, saying softly.

Han Li listened to Nan Gong Wan's words, and his mind flashed back to the past, remembering the events that had transpired with these people. He felt a mix of joy and nostalgia.

The past was vivid in his mind, but the heavens had separated them, and it was uncertain if they would ever meet again in this life. The path of cultivation was a lonely one, but with Nan Gong Wan by his side, he felt a sense of comfort.

“By the way, what about Yuan Yao? How is she doing?” Han Li asked hesitantly.

“Yuan Yao...” Nan Gong Wan's eyes dimmed, and she seemed to hesitate, unsure of how to continue.
"What's wrong with her?" Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he asked.

"Yuanyao also successfully advanced to the Great Vehicle, inheriting the mantle of Qingyuanzi, and later had a strange encounter, making rapid progress in her cultivation, even surpassing me in crossing the Heavenly Tribulation. Unfortunately, the Heavenly Tribulation is unpredictable, and Yuanyao ultimately failed to cross it..." Nangong Wan's eyes dropped, and she spoke in a melancholic tone.

Han Li's body stiffened, and his mind flashed back to Yuanyao's image, his vision blurring slightly.

Even though he had grown strong enough to kill two corpses, his heart still ached with an indescribable sorrow upon hearing the news of his friend's passing.

"Husband, life and death are predetermined, don't be too sad. Yuanyao had a long talk with me before her tribulation, saying that she had lived a fulfilling life, and regardless of whether she succeeded or not, she had no regrets." Nangong Wan added.

"Wan'er, don't worry, I'm fine. I've seen too many lives and deaths over the years, but hearing about a friend's passing still brings me sorrow." Han Li forced a smile, saying.

"According to the Wheel of Reincarnation's master, the Six Paths Wheel can control the reincarnation of countless lives, and if we have the chance in the future, we might be able to use this treasure to find Yuanyao's reincarnation." Nangong Wan hesitated before speaking.

"Yuanyao died in the Heavenly Tribulation, her soul scattered to the heavens, and it's uncertain whether her spirit can be preserved. Even if we find her reincarnation, it would already be someone else. Do we want to do what the Wheel of Reincarnation's master did, forcing them to recall their past memories? That would be equivalent to erasing the Yuanyao of this life." Han Li shook his head.

Nangong Wan had personally experienced this, and her feelings ran deeper, so she didn't say anything further.

"If we have the chance in the future, I'd like to return to the Spirit Realm and pay my respects at her grave." Han Li gently wrapped his arm around Nangong Wan's shoulders, sighing.

Now that he had advanced to the peak of the Great Luo, he could feel the differences between the interfaces even more. With his current abilities, entering the Spirit Realm would cause a massive disturbance in the heavenly energies, likely leading to the collapse of the interface.

Even in the True Immortal Realm, only True Immortals and lower-ranking immortals could enter the lower interfaces.

Nangong Wan nodded.

"Speaking of opportunities, I never thought that you would obtain the Heavenly Vessel back in the Mortal Realm. No wonder your cultivation progressed so quickly in the Mortal and Spirit Realms. You kept it hidden so well, even from me." She gazed at Han Li with a hint of reproach, changing the subject.

"This matter is too important, and if it were to be revealed, it would attract countless killing intentions, so I didn't tell you back then. Please don't be angry, Wan'er." Han Li smiled faintly.

"Now that it's come to this, I wouldn't blame you for that. You did the right thing, as the existence of this treasure is too earth-shattering. The more people who know, the greater the risk. If the Heavenly Court finds out that you possess this treasure, they might send people to steal it again, wouldn't they?" Nangong Wan asked with concern.

"No need to worry, the Heavenly Court is currently at war with the Wheel of Reincarnation, and they're too busy to bother with us. Moreover, my strength has grown significantly, and I can handle anyone in the True Immortal Realm except for three people. Keeping the Heavenly Vessel safe is not a problem." Han Li said confidently.

"Husband, you say that, and I believe you, but my cultivation is still weak, and I'm afraid I won't be able to help you much. The Three Thousand Great Daos are truly unpredictable, and there are even things like traversing time and space." Nangong Wan sighed.

"If you're interested, I can take you to try it." Han Li flipped the Heavenly Vessel, smiling.

"No, every time you use the Heavenly Vessel, you have to exhaust all the Time Dao markings in your body, which is too dangerous." Nangong Wan immediately shook her head.

Han Li chuckled, as he could now communicate with the Heavenly Dao and use the Heavenly Vessel to traverse time and space with a much lower cost.

Nangong Wan's concern for him warmed his heart.

"Then we'll discuss this later," Han Li said.

"Husband, what are your plans now?" Nangong Wan asked.

"I was so focused on rescuing you that I haven't thought about what to do next. However, my battles with Feng Qing and Chen Rushan in the Dragon Abyss Realm must have attracted some attention, so it's best if we leave this place for now." Han Li thought for a moment before speaking.

Nangong Wan naturally wouldn't object to this.
