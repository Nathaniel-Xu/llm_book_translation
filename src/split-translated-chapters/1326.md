Chapter:

"Father didn't say anything, but Feng Qing Shui is a Da Zong level existence, your cultivation..." Jiao San trailed off.

Han Li, upon hearing this, no longer suppressed the aura on his body, and a massive, boundless pressure suddenly burst forth, releasing a brilliant light that seemed to be made of gold.

Although he controlled it to be confined within a hundred meters, the flow of the world's energy seemed to be influenced by his mere thoughts.

He seemed to be the master, and even though he stood still, it was as if he dominated the heavens and the earth, causing those who gazed upon him to feel a massive shock.

The cultivation of the late stage of the Great Luo period was revealed in this moment.

Jiao San felt an invisible pressure rushing towards him, and he involuntarily took two steps back, his heart still reeling from the shock.

"I never thought that after so many years, you could have changed so much. No wonder...no wonder Father..." Jiao San took a deep breath and spoke slowly, but seemed to hesitate and didn't continue.

"He's facing the Heavenly Court, and can attract most of the attention. If I go find Feng Qing Shui, it would be a breakthrough, as long as he's not in the Heavenly Court right now." Han Li suppressed his aura once more and spoke.

"He's not in the Zhongtu Xian Domain, but in another large Xian Domain, the Longyuan Xian Domain, inside the fog dragon sect he founded, where he's been in seclusion for some time." Jiao San said.

"That's perfect, you help me prepare the things I need, and I'll set out tomorrow." Han Li said.

"Alright, you're planning to leave when, I'll go with you." Jiao San said.

"You can't go." Han Li immediately said.

"Why can't I go, Mother..." Jiao San's words were cut off by Han Li.

"She chose to be Nan Gong Wan, even if she's not your mother, she definitely wouldn't want you to go." Han Li looked at Jiao San and said.

"I don't care what you think, in my heart, she's still my mother, I must go." Jiao San said.

"With your current cultivation, you'll only be a hindrance. Besides, I need you to help me send Zi Ling to the Demon Realm." Han Li said bluntly.

Jiao San's face fell upon hearing this.

"Alright, with my cultivation, I'd only be a burden. But why does Zi Ling have to go to the Demon Realm?" Jiao San asked, his brow furrowed in confusion.

"What's wrong?" Han Li asked, sensing something was amiss.

"Don't you know what's happening in the Demon Realm? If Zi Ling is going to find Shi Chuan Kong, it's not necessary." Jiao San's eyes narrowed, and he spoke slowly.

Zi Ling's expression changed, and she felt a sense of foreboding.

"What's going on?" Han Li asked, his eyes narrowing.

"The Demon Realm has been in a state of civil war for over a thousand years, and the past hundred years have been especially brutal. The final battle seven years ago destroyed the entire Night City, and the Ji Liang Kun boundary was completely erased. Shi Chuan Kong's sect, the Shi Kong Jie, was defeated." Jiao San sighed, his voice low and mournful.

"What happened to Shi Kong Jie and Shi Chuan Kong, is there any news?" Han Li asked.

"The Demon Realm has been sealed off, and it's hard to get any news out. The last thing I heard was that Shi Kong Jie was defeated by the Demon Lord, and Shi Chuan Kong's whereabouts are unknown." Jiao San said.

Xie Dao Ren was killed, and Shi Chuan Kong was missing...

Han Li felt a sense of loss, and didn't know what to say.

"Has it been seven years since the war, and there's still no news?" Zi Ling asked.

"The Demon Lord personally ordered the sealing of the Demon Realm, and it's not clear when it will be reopened. Right now, no news can get in or out." Jiao San shook his head.

"This matter will have to wait, I'll go to the Demon Realm to investigate when I return from the Heavenly Court." Han Li took a deep breath, his expression solemn.

Jiao San didn't say anything else, just nodded.

"In that case, you should stay in the Underworld, and wait for us to return." Han Li said to Zi Ling.

Zi Ling's face was filled with worry, but she nodded.

"By the way, what's the news on Ti Hu?" Han Li asked.

"She...she went to the Luo Hun Deep Abyss." Jiao San replied.

"The Luo Hun Deep Abyss...what's that place?" Han Li asked.

"It's a true abyss in the Underworld, a place where even Father has never been. She said she was searching for the true Dao, and I tried to stop her, but couldn't." Jiao San said.

"How long has she been gone?" Han Li asked.

"Over a hundred years ago, she still hasn't returned." Jiao San said.

Han Li's eyes closed, and a white light flashed at his brow, flickering for a moment before reopening.

"What's wrong?" Zi Ling asked.

"Our spiritual connection has been severed..." Han Li muttered.

"It's said that the Luo Hun Deep Abyss is a place where spirits wander, and even if you're in the same place, you can't sense each other's presence." Jiao San said.

"This is the path Ti Hu chose, you have to believe in her." Zi Ling pulled on Han Li's arm, trying to comfort him.

Han Li remained silent for a long time, before nodding.

Ti Hu and Jin Tong were the same, they both had their own paths to follow, just like he had his own path to face the Heavenly Court.

"I'll set out tomorrow to the Longyuan Xian Domain, and you'll help me prepare the information about Feng Qing Shui." Han Li said to Jiao San.

That night, Han Li and Zi Ling lay on the inclined roof of the palace, gazing up at the starry sky they hadn't seen in years.

Unfortunately, the night sky was pitch black, with few stars visible, and even the moon was obscured by dark clouds, casting a hazy glow over everything.

Han Li turned his gaze back to Zi Ling, who was leaning against him, and saw that her beautiful face was still radiant in the dim light.

Her profile was slightly blurry in the moonlight, but it had a unique beauty to it.

"Zi Ling, I..." Han Li couldn't help but call out softly, reaching out to touch her cheek.

As for Zi Ling, Han Li felt a pang of guilt.
They had met by chance back then, and they had immediately hit it off, as if they were old friends who had known each other for a long time. It was as if they had found a kindred spirit, and their meeting was a stroke of good fortune that surpassed all others.

However, due to various circumstances, they had always been like strangers to each other.

"There's no need to say anything," Zi Ling said softly, her eyes still gazing out at the sky. "I'm already content with the peace and quiet of this moment."

Han Li heard her words and couldn't help but smile.

A moment later, Zi Ling reached out and took Han Li's arm, resting it on her own shoulder.

"This time, when you go, be extremely careful and bring back Wan'er without a single scratch. I won't go anywhere, and I'll wait for you here until you return."

Zi Ling looked up at Han Li and said, "Do you know what I saw in the Six Paths Reincarnation Disk in my past life?"

"What did you see?" Han Li asked immediately.

Zi Ling's expression turned calm, and she said, "Actually, there wasn't much turmoil or hardship in my past life. On the contrary, I was just an ordinary woman without a spiritual root, living a short life of only a hundred years. In that life, I waited for someone from my youth to old age, but that person never appeared."

As she finished speaking, her bright eyes locked onto Han Li's.

Han Li's heart skipped a beat, and he faintly heard a voice calling out to him, like the gentle voice of a woman from his dreams. However, he couldn't quite recall her face.

In a daze, he wrapped his arm around Zi Ling's neck, gently stroking her long hair as he drew her closer.

Zi Ling's body trembled slightly, but then she relaxed, leaning into Han Li's embrace. "So... I'm already satisfied with this life," she murmured. "It's not easy to meet someone, and we've formed a connection. What more could I ask for? What more could I regret?"

Han Li looked at her, and saw that her bright eyes were shining with a soft light, like a starry night sky. She was breathtakingly beautiful.

Just then, the night wind suddenly picked up, blowing away the last wisps of cloud and plunging the entire Yellow Spring Great Marsh into darkness. The soft, green glow of the phosphorescent fire rose up from the lake's surface, illuminating the surroundings.

After a moment of silence, the sky above began to drizzle with rain.

The rain in the underworld was different from that in the heavenly realm. The raindrops carried a hint of dark energy, making the rainwater feel heavy and oppressive. Although it wouldn't cause any harm, it was still unpleasant.

Han Li didn't want this rare moment of peace to be disrupted, so he raised his hand to dispel the clouds.

Zi Ling, however, grasped his arm and whispered, "Take me back."

Han Li looked at her, and his eyes widened as he realized what she meant.

He stopped speaking, and instead wrapped his arm around her waist, lifting her up and carrying her towards the palace.

The night deepened, and the clouds and rain gathered above the lake, growing more intense.

The rain continued to fall throughout the night, sometimes gently, sometimes fiercely.

As the storm raged on, the underworld was bathed in an otherworldly atmosphere.

When the rain finally stopped at dawn, Han Li opened his eyes to gaze at Zi Ling's sleeping form, her face still as beautiful as ever.

He didn't know how long he stared at her, but eventually, he opened his mouth to speak, only to realize he didn't know what to say. Instead, he let out a sigh.

He got up, changed into a new set of clothes, and stood by the bed for a moment before turning to leave.

As he walked out the door, he glanced back at Zi Ling, who was still sleeping peacefully. He gently closed the door behind him.

The candlelight in the room flickered, and then returned to its usual calm state.

When Han Li arrived at the palace entrance, Gan Jiu Zhen was already waiting for him.

"Is everything ready?" Han Li asked.

"Where's Zi Ling? Isn't she going to see you off?" Gan Jiu Zhen asked, looking around.

Han Li shook his head. "We said our goodbyes last night, so there's no need to say anything more today."

Gan Jiu Zhen looked puzzled, but didn't press the issue, assuming that Zi Ling was just reluctant to part with Han Li.

She handed Han Li a small, palm-sized token and a black jade slip. "This is a Bodhi Token. Since you're going to the Dragon Abyss Heavenly Realm, which is one of the thirty-six major heavenly realms, you can use this token to say you're attending the Bodhi Banquet in the Middle Earth Heavenly Realm. It's more convenient than any other travel permit."

Han Li took the token and examined it before nodding in approval.

Gan Jiu Zhen continued, "I also recorded some information about Feng Qing Shui and the Dragon Abyss Heavenly Realm on this jade slip. I hope it helps you."

Han Li took the jade slip and glanced at it before nodding. "This is enough."

Gan Jiu Zhen's expression turned serious. "You must bring Mother back safely."

Han Li nodded. "I will."

With that, he formed a hand seal and said, "I'll be off." A bolt of golden lightning struck the ground, and Han Li's figure disappeared into the distance.

Gan Jiu Zhen's eyes remained fixed on the spot where Han Li had vanished, her expression filled with worry.
