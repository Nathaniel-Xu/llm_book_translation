As Han Li stepped onto the last stone step, he arrived in front of the grand hall, and upon a glance, his eyebrows furrowed.

Before him, every brick on the grand hall was engraved with a symbol, and every column had a symbol written on it, dense and intricate, forming a massive symbol array.

The symbol style wasn't too difficult to recognize, and it was mostly used to reinforce the grand hall, making the entire Hall of Time itself like a treasure, with a solidity that surpassed even some high-grade treasures.

However, the grand hall's entrance didn't have any restrictive arrays set up.

Han Li raised his hand, and with a push, the two heavy doors swung open.

He stepped over the threshold, entered the hall, and swept his gaze around.

He saw that the interior space of the grand hall was much larger than he had imagined, and directly in front of him, he could see a massive five-sided stone pedestal, with a broad base and a narrow top, resembling an overturned square cauldron.

The pedestal had five sides, each made of different materials, displaying the five colors of "gold, blue, cyan, red, and yellow", and in the center, a strange symbol was engraved, which seemed to be an altar.

Han Li looked from afar, and saw that on the top platform of the five-colored altar, a gold-colored oil lamp was placed.

The gold-colored oil lamp's column was slightly curved, resembling the stem of a lotus, and the lamp's body was like a lotus flower bud, with petals unfolding, and a central lotus-shaped wick, emitting a brilliant golden light.

The golden light emanating from the gold-colored lamp formed a half-spherical golden light shield, enveloping the entire altar.

Although Han Li was still some distance away from the altar, he could feel the powerful time law fluctuations emanating from the gold-colored lamp, like a tidal wave crashing against the shore, causing his heart to stir.

"This is the Time God Lamp? Such powerful law fluctuations..."

At this moment, a voice of admiration came from the side, and it was Jiao San and the others who had arrived and entered the grand hall.

Qimozi brought Xiong Shan and the five demon kings, and they also entered the grand hall.

As soon as they entered the Hall of Time, Qimozi's eyes immediately fell upon the Time God Lamp, and he stared at it intently.

While the demon kings didn't pay much attention to the Time God Lamp, they all looked at the five-colored altar, with a faint look of fear on their faces.

Just as everyone's attention was drawn to the interior of the hall, a black and white light flashed out from the ground outside the hall, silently and swiftly flew in, and disappeared into the ground.

Han Li shifted his gaze from the Time God Lamp, glanced at Qimozi and the others, and his eyes slightly sank.

"Brother Han, I have a proposal, let's temporarily put aside our differences in this Hall of Time, what do you think?" Qimozi suddenly transmitted a message.

"I also have the same intention," Han Li replied without hesitation.

As for Qimozi's proposal, he didn't take it too seriously, but he had also made up his mind that as long as the other party didn't initiate a conflict, he wouldn't take the initiative to attack, after all, the grand hall was currently a mix of dragons and snakes, with everyone having their own intentions, and if he were to start a conflict with Qimozi first, it would naturally be a hundred times more harmful than beneficial.

For Han Li, whether it was his feud with Qimozi or his private desires for the Time God Lamp, they all had to be put after his own safety, and no matter what the situation, preserving his life was the top priority.

"The Life Token is also there," Huo San said, arriving beside Han Li.

Han Li turned his gaze, and saw that in the shadow of the Time God Lamp's golden light, three palm-sized blood-red tokens were neatly arranged, with a strong life aura emanating from them.

Without needing to think, those should be the Life Tokens of Li Qimu and Qu Lin.

Next to the three Life Tokens, a triangular black iron token was placed, with a symbol engraved on it, but it was somewhat unclear.

Han Li noticed that Jiao San's gaze, aside from lingering on the Time God Lamp, was mostly focused on this object.

He wanted to ask, but after a moment's thought, he restrained himself.

On the top platform of the altar, aside from these objects, there was a golden book scroll, rolled up and tied with a golden thread, but it couldn't be seen if there was any title on it.

When Lei Yu saw the golden book scroll, his eyes flashed with excitement, and he exchanged a glance with Wen Zhong, who also nodded with a look of joy, seemingly something important to their Tian Tian Sword Sect.

Han Li's gaze swept across the crowd, and his heart suddenly rose with a question, what had happened to Qu Lin, who had entered the hall first?

Just as he was wondering, Qimozi suddenly spoke up, saying to the crowd:
"Everyone..."

His words had barely left his lips when the entire great hall suddenly shook violently, and the previously opened doors closed on their own.

At the same time, the surroundings began to radiate a blinding golden light, and a powerful temporal law fluctuation enveloped the area, causing the surrounding void to distort.

Everyone felt as if they were wrapped in a golden space, and the flow of time around them slowed down significantly, while their thoughts and divine senses were severely restricted, making them feel sluggish.

Han Li didn't say a word, and with a swift hand seal, a brilliant golden light burst forth from his body, rapidly spreading to envelop everyone, including Lei Yuze.

Almost simultaneously, Qimozi also opened her spirit domain, enveloping Xiongshan and the five demons.

As everyone entered the temporal spirit domain, their thoughts and divine senses gradually returned to normal, but their movements were still severely restricted, making them feel less agile than before.

Just then, a massive circular light circle suddenly appeared on the ground in front of them, with a brilliant light emanating from within, and a series of blurry human figures emerged from it.

Han Li took a closer look and discovered that the figures were all Dao soldiers, each with a tall and slender build, wearing golden armor that seemed ill-fitting, and making a clanking sound as they moved.

These Dao soldiers appeared weak and frail, but each of them emitted a powerful aura.

What was even more astonishing was that these Dao soldiers didn't charge at them in a frenzy, but instead formed a series of orderly ranks, surrounding them layer by layer.

"What are they doing?" Lanyuanzi furrowed her brow, asking in confusion.

"Forming an array," Han Li replied calmly.

The Dao soldiers had already formed a special array, surrounding everyone in the center.

The Dao soldiers' golden armor glowed with a blinding light, and Han Li felt a sharp pain in his eyes, forcing him to narrow them.

He activated his Jiu You Mo Yan Shen Tong, and a purple light emanated from his eyes, making the dazzling light less piercing.

The others followed suit, using their own methods to counter the light, some using their spiritual eyes, others using artifacts to block the light.

Han Li scanned the area, seeing that the golden light was emanating from the Dao soldiers' armor, and that colorful symbols were appearing on their armor, flying off their bodies, and transforming into different colored lights that flowed back into their bodies.

As the lights entered their bodies, the Dao soldiers underwent strange transformations, with one group growing larger and more robust, another group growing even more massive, with their bodies covered in golden rock-like armor, and another group's armor melting away, revealing a flowing golden liquid.

The red light-infused Dao soldiers had flames erupting from their armor, while the golden light-infused Dao soldiers held golden spears with intricate patterns.

"This is incredible," Jiao San exclaimed, his eyes wide with wonder. "How can there be so many Dao soldiers with different attributes?"

"These Dao soldiers are already incredibly powerful, each with the strength of a Golden Immortal," Han Li said calmly. "And they're all imbued with the power of the five elements. This is impossible!"

"Ha! It seems I underestimated the old man, Wenhui, after all," Qimozi said with a chuckle.

"Lei Yuze, what's going on?" Lanyuanzi asked, turning to Lei Yuze.

"I...I don't know," Lei Yuze replied, looking surprised.

Although he should have been the most knowledgeable about the Suiyue Tower, the constant surprises had shown that even he didn't fully understand it.

"The Dao soldiers' attributes are changing due to the array and the five-element altar," Han Li explained. "They're responding to each other, creating this phenomenon."

"You mean that the Dao soldiers' attributes are being influenced by the five-element altar?" Jiao San asked, furrowing his brow.
