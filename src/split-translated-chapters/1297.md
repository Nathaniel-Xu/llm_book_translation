In front of the palace's main gate, amidst the vast and misty surroundings, aside from the numerous ghostly soldiers scattered about, two extremely tall and stalwart ghostly generals stood guard, holding their weapons and standing majestically still.

One of them, despite having a human body, had a massive and ferocious ox head, and wore thick black iron armor, holding a iron staff engraved with skull patterns, half of which was crimson and half of which was dark blue, like the fusion of water and fire.

The other, similarly, had a human body, but with a long and ugly horse face, wore a deep crimson heavy armor, holding a string of red crystal stone locks in one hand, and a pale white ghostly claw in the other, which seemed to be stained with black blood.

The two of them stood motionless, like two statues, making the already ominous palace seem even more eerie and foreboding, like the legendary Gate of Hell.

However, above the palace gates, there was no signboard, and the two massive doors were tightly closed.

At this moment, deep beneath the palace, there was a vast underground space, lit up by torches, illuminating every corner.

In the center of this space, there was a massive six-sided stone platform, about a thousand feet in diameter, and only three feet high, smooth as a mirror, and naturally formed, with a six-sided depression in the center, filled with dark red liquid.

Above the liquid, a dark red glow emanated, with threads of light swirling around it, and in the center, a massive six-sided wheel floated in mid-air.

The wheel was engraved with various symbols, emitting strange and mysterious energy, and an otherworldly aura that made one feel incredibly small.

At this moment, at the edge of the pool, facing the six-sided wheel, stood a tall, black-robed man, with a wide-brimmed hat on his head, and a black veil covering his face.

However, what was even more peculiar was that this man, despite having a subdued aura, seemed to exude an aura of immense power, surpassing even the six-sided wheel.

The man nodded slightly, his veil falling onto his chest, as if he was deep in thought.

At this moment, footsteps echoed from afar, and a beautiful, pale-skinned woman in a black dress, with a stunningly beautiful woman in a blue palace dress, walked onto the platform, approaching the man.

The woman in black was none other than Jiao San.

Her beauty was unmatched, and the woman in blue was even more stunning, but was actually none other than the woman known as "Ru Xue" in the Wheel of Reincarnation.

If Han Li were present, he would not have recognized her, for her appearance and demeanor were identical to Nangong Wan's.

Jiao San held her hand, feeling the smooth skin, but also a slight chill, which contrasted with her own warm palm.

Compared to the heat in her palm, Jiao San's emotions were even more turbulent, her brow furrowed, and her expression serious, as she couldn't help but steal glances at Ru Xue.

Ever since she learned that Ru Xue was her mother, Jiao San couldn't look at her with the same eyes, but the latter, with her soul incomplete, was oblivious to her observations, and simply walked towards the center of the platform with a calm expression.

"Lord."

Jiao San bowed, releasing Ru Xue's hand, and addressed the man.

Ru Xue also bowed.

"Enter," the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation turned around, his eyes falling on the two women, and said.

Jiao San heard his words, and took Ru Xue's hand, walking towards the pool.

Ru Xue hesitated for a moment, looking at Jiao San.

Jiao San smiled warmly, and gestured for her to enter the pool.

Ru Xue lifted her skirt, and walked down the steps, into the pool.

The water was not too deep, and she only reached chest-deep.

However, as soon as she stood still, and tried to turn around, her eyes suddenly dimmed, and she fell backwards, into the water.

Jiao San saw her fall, and her body floated to the surface, but her expression did not change, as if she had expected this, though her eyes showed a hint of doubt.

"Lord, why did you ask me to bring... my mother here? Why does she not remember me, and not know our mother-daughter relationship?" Jiao San asked, her brow furrowed.

"Your mother does not remember you, because she has already reincarnated once, and naturally, her memories are gone," the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation replied.

"What do you mean by 'reincarnated once'?" Jiao San asked.

"My meaning is... that her previous life was your true mother, named 'Gan Ru Xue'. And this life, she is surnamed Nangong, with the single name 'Wan'. To make her remember you, you must help her recover her memories from her previous life," the Lord of the Wheel of Reincarnation said, after a moment of contemplation.

Jiao San heard the name "Nangong Wan", and felt a sense of familiarity, but did not pay attention, and instead asked: "Gan Ru Xue... I am Gan Jiu Zhen, do I share the same surname as my mother?"

Her mind was filled with questions, why did her mother die in her previous life? Where was her father? Did her reincarnated mother still count as her mother?

But in the end, she only asked one question: "Why do I not remember my mother?"
Chapter:

"You saw your mother only once at birth, so how could you have any memories of her?" the master of the Wheel of Rebirth said.

"Did my mother die because of me?" Jiao San asked, her body feeling icy cold.

"No," the master of the Wheel of Rebirth said firmly.

"But my mother..."

"Nine Truths, you have too many questions. Everything will be explained after she regains her memories," the master of the Wheel of Rebirth said coldly, interrupting her.

Jiao San fell silent, standing to the side and gazing at the figure in the water.

The master of the Wheel of Rebirth clasped his hands together and began to chant, his fingers weaving a complex pattern.

His robes billowed without wind, and a dark red aura swirled around him. He pointed at the six-sided wheel in the air, and a solid red light column shot out, striking the wheel.

A loud whooshing sound filled the air as the wheel began to rotate, its speed increasing rapidly.

The red glow surrounding it was drawn into the rotation, swirling around the wheel. A straight red light beam shot down from above, enveloping Nan Gong Wan's body.

Nan Gong Wan's eyebrows furrowed, and her eyes rolled back and forth, as if she was trapped in a vivid dream.

But soon, she stopped moving, and her body began to sink slowly into the water.

...

In the Yellow Springs, the blood-red cloud wall blocked out the sun, and the original valley landscape was gone. Han Li and the others were like tiny boats navigating through a mountain tunnel, with the blood clouds swirling above them.

"Once we exit this area, we'll be close to the lake's center," Gui Wu said.

Han Li nodded, not responding.

Their journey so far had been relatively smooth, with only two close calls with the whirlwinds. It seemed that Gui Wu's secret waterway was safe.

About half an hour later, the boat emerged from a whirlwind and entered a calm area. The blood clouds and whirlwinds were gone, and the air was still.

"This is strange. Why is there a windless area here?" Gui Wu asked, surprised.

"Isn't it a good thing?" Qi Hun asked, puzzled.

"Not necessarily. The appearance of a windless area means that our planned route has changed. If there's no wind here, the original waterway might be blocked. We could be trapped in this maze," Han Li said, shaking his head.

Just then, his expression changed, and he looked towards the blood cloud wall.

The cloud wall, which had been static, suddenly began to move, surging towards the windless area.

A massive shadow appeared behind the cloud wall.

"What is this?" Gui Wu asked, his face changing.

Qi Hun's eyes flashed with a strange light.

As the blood clouds churned, a gigantic, thousand-meter-long black beast emerged from the lake's surface. It was shaped like a crocodile-turtle, with four massive fins on its underside.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed as he watched. The beast's fins created a black whirlwind that lifted its body off the water, allowing it to float and move.

"What kind of beast is this, unaffected by the whirlwinds?" Qi Hun asked.

"This is impossible. The You Fu Gui has been extinct for tens of thousands of years. How can it still exist?" Gui Wu asked, his face filled with shock.

"There's someone on its back," Han Li said, his eyes fixed on the beast.

Gui Wu and Qi Hun followed his gaze, seeing seven or eight figures standing on the beast's back. The leader was a tall, imposing figure in a gray robe, with a white skull visible beneath. A white aura surrounded him, and he exuded a powerful presence.

Behind the skull-faced figure stood a three-meter-tall, blood-red man with no head, his eyes replaced by breasts. He wielded a massive blood-colored axe, and Han Li recognized him as Xue Li.

Xue Li was followed by several others, including the ghostly general who had led the ghostly army in pursuit of Han Li.

Han Li saw them, and they noticed him.

Xue Li's eyes flashed with a fierce light, and he leapt into the air, his axe swinging towards Han Li.
