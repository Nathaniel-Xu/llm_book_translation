Dong Li Hu said, "What Zhu Yan said is correct. If I had any doubts before, now that I've seen these two, I can sense the fluctuations in their aura, and I know they're not easy to deal with. Moreover, we are all Daozu, and we are bound by the Heavenly Dao. If we were to engage in a life-or-death struggle, it would be a loss for us in the end."

Meng Yuan hesitated, "This matter was entrusted to us by the Supreme, and if we don't take action, it would be a dereliction of duty..."

Zhu Yan smiled and said, "Meng Yuan, if you're really worried about it, why don't you take the initiative to enter the fray first? We won't stand by and watch, and we'll take the opportunity to test your extraordinary abilities. What do you say?"

Meng Yuan's eyes narrowed, and he felt a surge of anger in his heart.

Purple Xuan interrupted, "Enough, now that we've trapped these two, as long as they can't cause trouble in the Heavenly Court, there's no need to take any further action. We'll just have to wait for the Bodhi Banquet to end, and the Supreme will make a decision then."

Among the four, Purple Xuan was clearly the leader, and after she spoke, the others fell silent.

Meng Yuan, who looked like a child, secretly breathed a sigh of relief in his heart. He wasn't really eager to fight Han Li to the death, and he had only said those words to have an excuse in case he was blamed later.

After all, it was the others who didn't want to fight.

"Who would have thought that we'd be stuck here, watching the Bodhi Banquet from afar? It seems we won't be able to taste the flavor of the Bodhi fruit..." The old woman sighed, her voice filled with regret.

The others also sighed, and their resentment towards Han Li grew.

...

In the Zhongtu Xianyu, outside the Heavenly Gate of the South, a massive spirit ship hovered in the air, its flags fluttering in the wind. A giant banner stood at the center, bearing the words "Lunhui Hall" in large letters.

The spirit ship and the surrounding void were filled with people, most of whom wore the uniform of the Lunhui Hall and wore masks of various colors. They were all arrayed in a state of high alert.

On the deck of the leading spirit ship, seven or eight figures stood in a row, six of whom wore black masks. Only the two in the center revealed their true faces.

One of them was a young man with silver hair, who was not very tall but had a muscular build. His face was covered with a black cloth, revealing only his mouth and nose, and his eyes shone with a fierce killing intent.

Behind him, he wore two green war knives, their blades long and narrow, without scabbards. The knives seemed to be alive, emitting a faint green mist that swirled around them.

Next to him stood a young man with dark skin, who was as tall as a iron tower. He was none other than Wu Yang.

"Tan Lang, has the Hall Master entered the Heavenly Court yet?" Wu Yang asked, his brow furrowed with concern.

"He's already entered through the Eastern Heavenly Gate. In a few hours, the Bodhi Banquet will begin," the silver-haired young man replied slowly, his voice like a low growl.

"How are Yan Zhi and Xuan Yu doing?" Wu Yang asked, his heart filled with unease.

"You're too anxious... relax, it's they who should be anxious..." Tan Lang raised his hand, pointing to the distant Heavenly Gate.

Wu Yang followed his gaze, and saw the Heavenly Gate behind which a massive transmission array was located. The array was currently in operation, with powerful spatial ripples emanating from it.

That was the site of the great transmission array that connected the Zhongtu Xianyu to other Xianyu, and it was currently bustling with activity. Many of the top experts from the various Xianyu were gathering there, including Daozu and Daluo cultivators.

"My Cold Green Knives are getting impatient, waiting to taste the blood of our enemies..." Tan Lang's voice was like a low chuckle, and his face twisted into a cruel smile.

His black cloth-covered face revealed a shocking scar that ran from his ear to his mouth.

...

Apart from the Northern Heavenly Gate, the Lunhui Hall had also deployed its forces outside the Eastern and Western Heavenly Gates, facing off against the Heavenly Court in a stalemate that had lasted for some time.

Although both sides had made provocative moves, neither had launched a full-scale attack, and they seemed to be exercising restraint.

Among the three Heavenly Gates, the Northern Heavenly Gate was the most lively, with all the transmission arrays operating at full capacity, constantly transporting cultivators from the various Xianyu to the Bodhi Banquet.

The nine great continents of the Zhongtu Xianyu were all decorated with lanterns and streamers, filled with a festive atmosphere.

The various sects and clans that were rooted in the Zhongtu Xianyu, although they may not have had the qualifications to attend the Bodhi Banquet, still felt a sense of pride and joy. They held their own grand ceremonies during the banquet, and the clans from other Xianyu that were friendly with them also came to visit, sharing in the excitement of the Bodhi Banquet.

Moreover, the great merchant clans and treasure-hunting sects were taking advantage of the opportunity to hold their own treasure exhibitions, gathering all sorts of precious treasures from the various Xianyu and attracting countless cultivators and rogue cultivators.

However, these festivities were merely a sideshow, and the true focus of attention was still the official venues set up on the nine great continents of the Zhongtu Xianyu. That was where the most powerful and prestigious figures of the True Immortal Realm had gathered.
The central region of the Tian Palace Continent was a vast basin, where many important offices of the Heavenly Court were located. The main venue of the Bodhi Banquet was situated in the midst of the vast cloud sea above this region.

From the bottom of the basin, one could see the cloud sea stretching out in every direction, with a kaleidoscope of colors and a misty aura that seemed to shift and change with the wind. On occasion, one could even catch a glimpse of divine horses and celestial maidens dancing in the clouds.

In fact, there was a massive floating island suspended above the cloud sea, known as the Yaochi Paradise, which was the dwelling place of the Seven Rulers of the Heavens. This island was said to be the residence of the Time Emperor, both past and present.

The Yaochi Paradise was surrounded by a ring of mountains, where the air was filled with spiritual energy and the sound of gentle waterfalls. The waterfalls cascaded down the mountainside, creating a misty veil that seemed to shimmer and shine like a thousand pearls.

At the foot of the waterfalls, a group of nine-colored divine deer grazed peacefully, their eyes calm and serene. In the nearby forest, the sound of birdsong echoed through the trees, and one could catch a glimpse of celestial apes playing in the branches.

Above the forest, a flock of vermilion-crowned cranes flew by, their cries echoing through the air like the music of the heavens. The atmosphere was one of natural beauty and tranquility.

Higher up in the sky, a multitude of colorful lights converged on the Yaochi Paradise, like a rainbow gathering at the center of the universe. Among these lights, one could see phoenix chariots and dragon carriages racing by, as well as a group of celestial beings in elegant attire, flying through the air with ease.

As one approached the center of the Yaochi Paradise, the spiritual energy grew thicker, and the air was filled with the fragrance of celestial flowers. Even the dew that collected on the leaves of the trees seemed to be imbued with the essence of the divine.

Every morning and evening, a group of celestial children and maidens would gather in the Yaochi Paradise to collect the dew and use it to brew a divine elixir.

At the heart of the Yaochi Paradise was a crystal-clear lake, its surface smooth and unbroken like a mirror. The lake was surrounded by a ring of mountains, and its shape resembled a folded fan. This was the Qingming Lake, a place of great beauty and tranquility.

Behind the Qingming Lake stood an ancient locust tree, its trunk twisted and gnarled with age. The tree was said to be thousands of years old, and its branches seemed to stretch up to the heavens like a canopy.

Beneath the locust tree stood a small, two-story pavilion, which was said to be the former residence of the Time Emperor. The pavilion was simple and unadorned, but it seemed to radiate a sense of peace and tranquility.

Outside the Qingming Lake, a massive, semicircular plaza had been constructed. The plaza was paved with white spirit jade, and a series of narrow canals had been dug to channel the water from the lake into the plaza. The canals divided the plaza into a series of long, narrow sections, each one surrounded by a low wall.

On each of these sections, a large, purple jade table had been placed, surrounded by a multitude of celestial fruits and delicacies. The tables were arranged in a dense, maze-like pattern, and the air was filled with the fragrance of incense and the sound of celestial music.

At regular intervals, a group of celestial maidens would dance on a raised platform, their movements elegant and refined. The atmosphere was one of joy and celebration, and the guests who had gathered for the Bodhi Banquet seemed to be in high spirits.

At the center of the plaza, a group of seven purple jade tables stood empty, awaiting the arrival of the honored guests. Nearby, a group of elderly celestial beings sat in silence, their eyes closed in meditation.

These elderly beings were the leaders of the various celestial sects, and they were said to possess great wisdom and power. They were surrounded by a group of young, celestial disciples, who seemed to be bursting with curiosity and excitement.

One of the elderly beings, a white-haired old woman, sat with her eyes closed, her body swaying gently back and forth. She seemed to be in a state of deep meditation, but her eyes were actually fixed on a young woman who sat behind her.

The young woman, a celestial maiden with skin as white as snow and hair as black as the night, seemed to be in a state of deep sleep. Her body swayed gently back and forth, and her eyes were closed in a peaceful expression.

But as she swayed forward, her body suddenly emitted a burst of purple light, and a series of tiny, purple snakes seemed to emerge from her body. The old woman's eyes snapped open, and she reached out to touch the young woman's forehead.

The young woman's eyes fluttered open, and she looked up at the old woman with a confused expression. "Master," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

The old woman smiled and said, "Dream Cold, I told you not to practice the Five Thunder True Scripture while you were still learning the Great Dream Spring and Autumn. If you're not careful, you'll end up hurting yourself."

The young woman, whose name was Yu Menghan, looked up at the old woman with a sheepish expression. She had been practicing the Five Thunder True Scripture, a powerful and ancient text, but she had not been careful enough, and her body had begun to emit the purple light.

The old woman, who was the leader of the Mengtan Sect, looked at Yu Menghan with a mixture of concern and amusement. She had taken Yu Menghan as her disciple many years ago, and she had taught her the secrets of the Great Dream Spring and Autumn.
