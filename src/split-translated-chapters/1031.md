Han Li's transformed golden fur giant ape's two massive palms pressed down on the two metal beasts, its eyes flickering slightly.

If he really wanted to kill the two beasts, he had plenty of ways to do so, but he was hesitant at the moment, and had the idea of taking in the two strange beasts as guardians of the Flower Branch Cave Heaven.

Just as he was hesitating, the two metal beasts' long tails suddenly connected, and two dazzling golden lights appeared at the same time. The two metal beasts' bodies suddenly liquefied and merged into one, and in the blink of an eye, they transformed into a massive golden tiger.

After merging, the golden wings on the metal beast's back grew several times larger, but compared to its body size, they still seemed a bit out of proportion.

"Still able to merge, worthy of being a true and pure gold-attributed yuan qi heavenly beast!" Han Li exclaimed, feeling the beast's aura surge.

The metal beast's aura surged, and its temper seemed to worsen, letting out a loud roar as it pounced towards Han Li.

But just as it did, a sudden change occurred!

The colorful flames in the pool behind it erupted violently, and a massive flame bird with wings spread wide flew out of the pool, its beak pointed downwards.

Han Li's words were cut off, and the flame bird's sharp beak had already bitten the metal beast in two, and then swallowed it whole.

"Pity..."

Han Li's hand was still raised in a stopping motion, but it was too late.

The flame bird looked at Han Li with a tilted head, seemingly not understanding his intentions.

"Never mind, never mind, since you've eaten it, it's fine. In the future, when I find Xiao Bai, I'll let him take care of the place, it's not bad," Han Li said with a forced smile, waving his hand.

As he spoke, he withdrew his True Spirit Bloodline power and returned to his human form.

The massive flame bird also shrunk down, and with the colorful flames, it came to the edge of the pool.

Han Li walked forward, and saw that the flame bird was holding a wing, and on it were four round beads the size of dragon eye nuclei, with colors of yellow, green, blue, and red, matching the colors of the pool's flames.

The four beads shone brightly, emitting waves of scorching heat.

"Seven-colored fire dan sand, there's so much of it?" Han Li exclaimed.

The flame bird opened and closed its beak several times, but made no sound, and Han Li understood its meaning:

"You're saying that there's still one red dan sand, which you've eaten?"

The flame bird nodded its head enthusiastically, and the flames in the pool also surged with excitement.

"Ha ha, that's good. If you can refine and absorb all of these seven-colored fire dan sand, your flame power will increase again, and even the legendary Heaven-burning Earth-refining won't be impossible," Han Li said with a laugh.

The flame bird was overjoyed, and its body fell backwards, lying down in the pool like a swimmer, and without moving its wings, it slid backwards with a contented expression.

"You refine those fire dan sand well, I'll go check if there are any other mechanisms, if anything unexpected happens, immediately contact me with your spirit, I'll come find you," Han Li said after a moment of thought.

The flame bird jumped out of the pool and dove back in, indicating that it understood.

Han Li checked the surroundings of the colorful flames pool for a while, and found nothing out of the ordinary, before turning to leave through the tunnel.

After passing through a hundred-meter-long underground tunnel, the terrain gradually rose, and Han Li walked out of the tunnel.

Outside the tunnel, Han Li walked out from behind a screen at the entrance, and entered a golden great hall.

The great hall was empty, with no decorations, only three round white jade cushions in the center, with ring-shaped patterns engraved on them, layered like a maze.

Han Li stared at it for a while, and felt a bit dizzy, before regaining his composure.

"Interesting..."

He smiled and said, walking forward to examine it closely, and found that the three white jade cushions were connected to the ground, and couldn't be moved.

However, apart from that, there was nothing unusual, and no matter how he used his spiritual sense or tried to probe with his immortal energy, the three white jade cushions remained still, without any changes.

Han Li looked at it for a while, and then lost interest, pushing open the door and leaving.

Outside the hall, he found himself in the golden buildings he had seen from afar.

The great hall was surrounded by a white stone plaza, with a stone sundial in the center, and nothing else.
At the other end of the White Stone Square, there was a grand and majestic gate that led to a large mansion.

Han Li did not hurry to leave the mansion, instead, he walked along the road beside the grand hall, passed through a circular archway, and entered a garden filled with flowers and trees.

Inside the garden, there were many rare and exotic plants, including some that were in full bloom, emitting a gentle and ethereal glow. The flowers were a vibrant mix of colors, swaying gently in the breeze.

Han Li stepped into the garden, and his expression changed slightly, as if he had sensed something. He felt a hint of the Time Law's power, just like he had when he was by the spring earlier.

However, this power was dispersed and faint, and Han Li couldn't pinpoint its location, even with his full concentration. He could only sense that it was emanating from the flowers around him, but it was too subtle to grasp.

Han Li randomly plucked a nine-petaled purple flower and examined it carefully. He found that it only had a small amount of spiritual energy remaining, and no Time Law power.

"This is indeed strange," Han Li sighed, continuing on his way.

After passing through the garden, he came to a small, independent courtyard with three rooms: a left wing, a right wing, and a central main hall.

Han Li entered the left wing first, and found that the interior was simple, with only a few bookshelves against the walls, filled with stacks of books.

He randomly took down a book and flipped through it, only to find that it was not a profound or ancient text, but rather a collection of ordinary poetry and essays.

Han Li's curiosity was piqued, and he took down another book, only to find that it was a novel of romantic fiction.

"Ha ha, it seems that the master of this immortal mansion has a wide range of interests," Han Li said to himself, chuckling.

He spent a short time in the room, which seemed to be used as a study, before exiting and heading to the right wing.

The room was filled with various trinkets and ornaments, including gold and silver decorations, jade and porcelain vessels, but not a single magical artifact or immortal tool.

Han Li browsed through the room, and couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment at the master's taste in collecting such gaudy and ostentatious items.

Finally, he came to the central main hall, where he found a large, half-person-high furnace, with two wooden racks on either side, filled with various bottles and jars.

Han Li examined the furnace and found that the fire had long since gone out, but the bottles on the racks contained a variety of medicinal pills, including some of the highest quality.

"Finally, I've found something worthwhile," Han Li said, collecting all the pills.

As he was about to leave, he suddenly frowned, his eyes fixed on the furnace.

"What's this?"

Han Li's heart stirred, and he sensed a faint spiritual energy emanating from the furnace.

He walked over, lifted the furnace lid, and was met with a burst of golden light, which contained a strong Time Law energy.

Han Li's eyes widened, and he saw that the furnace contained ten golden pills, each the size of a dragon's eye.

He carefully picked up one of the pills and examined it, only to find that it was not yet fully formed, and its power was still dispersed.

"This is strange," Han Li thought to himself. "The master of this immortal mansion must have been interrupted or distracted, why didn't he finish refining these pills?"

Han Li hesitated for a moment, then put the pill back, and closed the furnace lid.

He then thought of summoning the Fire Bird to help him refine the pills, but remembered that it was currently busy refining the Seven-Color Fire Sand.

Han Li smiled wryly, and instead used his own internal fire to ignite the furnace.

The flames burned brightly, and after 49 days, the furnace finally produced a golden mist that condensed into a spirit fungus-like shape.

Han Li sat cross-legged beside the furnace, watching the scene unfold, and couldn't help but exclaim:

"Ah, it's a Flowing Fire Spirit Fungus! No wonder the Time Law energy is so dense. It's been left here for who knows how many years, and yet it still has such a strong potential for refinement."

Han Li then waved his hand, and the flames died down, before opening the furnace lid to reveal the results.

Seven of the pills had been successfully refined, each with four Dao patterns on its surface, emitting a strong Time Law energy.

Han Li's eyes shone with excitement, knowing that with these pills, he could make great progress in his cultivation of the Five Elements Fantasy Realm Technique.
