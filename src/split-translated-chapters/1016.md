"This should be an unopened water government, right?" After a moment, Han Li suddenly pointed to the bottom of the map and asked.

"Not bad, this is indeed the case. However, I must advise you, esteemed guest, that even if you're interested in this place, it's not worth trying. It's pointless." The round-faced old man glanced at Han Li, smiling and waving his hand.

"Why is that?" Han Li asked curiously.

"Please don't be offended, I'm only warning you out of kindness. I don't want to see you end up empty-handed. This water government has been attempted by many, including True Immortal and Golden Immortal cultivators, but none have succeeded. The grand entrance's restrictive spell alone has deterred everyone, and two unfortunate souls tried to force their way through, triggering the spell's counterattack. One was severely injured, and the other lost his life, unable to even escape with his Nascent Soul." The round-faced old man shook his head, sighing.

"I see, thank you for the warning. I have some knowledge of restrictive spells, so I'm confident I can at least protect myself. Don't worry, I've made up my mind to choose this place." Han Li revealed a thoughtful expression, then said.

"Very well... I'll wish you good luck, esteemed guest. Once you've paid the fee, I'll send someone to escort you." The round-faced old man saw Han Li's determination and stopped trying to dissuade him, speaking instead.

After Han Li paid the fee, the round-faced old man no longer bothered with him, sending a young girl in a red dress with a gentle complexion to escort him to the Three Rivers Lake.

The girl had a round face with two shallow dimples, giving her a perpetually smiling appearance. She seemed friendly and approachable.

Han Li and the girl flew down from the Comb Mountains, following a small path along the lake's edge towards the shore.

"I don't think you're a foolish person, esteemed guest, so why did you choose this Ghostly Concerns Government?" The girl asked, leading the way.

"Ghostly Concerns Government? What do you mean by that?" Han Li asked, furrowing his brow.

"It's because since this water government was opened, no one has been able to open it. Instead, many people have been injured or lost their lives trying. It's as if the government is 'ghostly' and 'concerning'! We've given it the nickname 'Ghostly Concerns Government' in private. However, this isn't its official name. If you're able to open it, you can give it a more auspicious name."

"Oh, 'Ghostly Concerns Government' is a good name. Let's just call it that." Han Li thought for a moment before saying.

"This... isn't me being talkative, but perhaps we should wait until you've actually opened the water government before naming it. Ah... esteemed guest, if you're willing to listen, I advise you not to force it when you're underwater. If you can't handle the restrictive spell, please return immediately and don't be stubborn." The girl seemed to remember something and warned Han Li.

"By the way, what's your name?" Han Li asked, smiling.

The girl was taken aback, seemingly surprised that someone had asked her name. After a moment, she replied, "My name is Hu Xiaocheng."

"Xiaocheng... a name that implies stability and contentment. It's a good name." Han Li nodded thoughtfully.

After speaking, he fell silent, his mind wandering to another name: Ye Susu.

Just last month, he had heard a rumor that the city of Qinghu had been suddenly attacked by a divine calamity, burning the entire city to ashes and killing everyone. Han Li had only thought about it briefly before realizing what had happened, which was why he had come to the Three Rivers Lake.

The girl saw Han Li's expression change and wisely stopped talking, leading him in silence.

When they arrived at the lake's edge, the gentle breeze blowing from the lake's surface made Hu Xiaocheng feel comfortable, and she couldn't help but stretch and take a deep breath.

Han Li gazed out at the sparkling lake, feeling a sense of freedom and joy that he hadn't experienced in a long time. The shadows in his heart had faded slightly.

"We're here, esteemed guest. If you head down from the water's edge, you'll reach the Ghostly Concerns Government after a few hundred feet." Hu Xiaocheng pointed, looking at Han Li.

"Thank you. Please wait here, I'll be back soon." Han Li nodded, then suddenly dove into the water without waiting for Hu Xiaocheng's response.

Hu Xiaocheng's eyes widened as she tried to speak, but Han Li was already gone. She let out a soft sigh and muttered to herself, "Why is he in such a hurry? I didn't even get to warn him about the dangers... Ah, well, I suppose it's not my place to worry about him. He seems like a big shot, but he's probably just a True Immortal cultivator at best. How could he possibly open the Ghostly Concerns Government? It's just a pipe dream!"

Just as Hu Xiaocheng was about to continue, the water's surface erupted in a massive wave, and a figure appeared beside her. When she opened her eyes to see Han Li standing there, she was taken aback, then smiled and said...
“So you're back already? I thought you'd at least try for a few hours before giving up, but I suppose it's good that you didn't get stuck in the restrictions. You're quite lucky, indeed.”

“You little girl, you're not even that old, but your mind is full of twists and turns. Go call your elder and tell them I want to pay the fee for opening this place.”

Han Li raised his hand and patted Hu Xiao Cheng's forehead, smiling as he said this.

“What...you mean you've already...” Hu Xiao Cheng's eyes widened in shock.

“Go ahead,” Han Li said with a smile, not confirming or denying anything.

Hu Xiao Cheng shook her head and turned to leave, flying towards the mountain.

Not long after, the round-faced elder returned with Hu Xiao Cheng, looking just as surprised.

After he personally checked the place, he finally believed that Han Li had indeed broken through the restrictions, his face filled with a mix of shock and amazement.

After Han Li paid the fee in spirit stones, the round-faced elder smiled and said, “This place will belong to you, Han Li, for the next three years. As we previously said, all the treasures produced here, as long as they don't affect the continuation of the water mansion, will belong to you alone.”

“Thank you,” Han Li said with a bow.

“By the way, now that this place is open, I hope you'll give it a name,” the round-faced elder added.

Han Li glanced at Hu Xiao Cheng and said, “Let's call it Gui Chou Fu.”

The round-faced elder's expression changed for a moment, but he didn't say anything else and simply nodded.

As he prepared to leave, he said, “Xiao Cheng, you'll stay with Han Li and attend to him. If you have any needs, report back to the sect immediately.”

Hu Xiao Cheng quickly bowed and said, “Yes, sir.”

Han Li nodded slightly, not refusing the offer.

“Want to take a look at Gui Chou Fu?” Han Li asked Hu Xiao Cheng after the round-faced elder left.

Hu Xiao Cheng nodded eagerly.

Han Li raised his hand and grasped Hu Xiao Cheng's shoulder, and a layer of blue light enveloped them both. They leaped forward, plunging into the lake.

The surface of the lake still had sunlight, but as they descended, it grew darker.

Hu Xiao Cheng had guided people to other water mansions before, but she had never been this deep. She kept her eyes wide open, looking around.

The lake was filled with broken mountain peaks, some still intact, others shattered into small mounds. The peaks had clusters of light on them, which upon closer inspection, revealed various colored screens covering the water mansions. These water mansions were far away, looking like stars in the night sky.

Han Li brought Hu Xiao Cheng to the bottom of the lake, stopping in front of a small mountain.

Hu Xiao Cheng looked up and saw a screen of light on top of the mountain, with a narrow, winding courtyard hidden inside.

Han Li pulled her arm, and they burst through the screen of light, entering the courtyard.

As they landed on the square, Han Li dispelled the light covering them.

“Ancestor's Hall...this is actually the Ancestor's Hall of that sect?” Hu Xiao Cheng exclaimed, looking at the inscription on the gate.

“Otherwise, why do you think no one has been able to break through the restrictions here for so many years?” Han Li smiled.

“Then, sir, how did you break through the restrictions?” Hu Xiao Cheng asked without thinking.

“I've read a lot of books,” Han Li replied with a smile.

He had actually seen the protective array of the Ancestor's Hall in an ancient text, and it wasn't a mountain-protecting array, so breaking it wasn't too difficult.

“Sir, you've really hit the jackpot this time! The Ancestor's Hall usually has the sect's secret classics and heavy treasures...” Hu Xiao Cheng said, her eyes gleaming with envy.
