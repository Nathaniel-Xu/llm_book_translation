On the right side of the ancient or modern, a lovely girl with a blue short skirt stood, forming a stark contrast with the red-clad old woman on the left. She was not only dressed in a cool and refreshing outfit, but also had a sweet smile on her face, captivating everyone's heart at first sight.

On her head, two delicate dragon horns grew, and her long black hair was transformed into numerous small braids. Her round eyes were full of spirit, and her arms and ankles were adorned with exquisite blue circular rings, which were also decorated with small bells.

Such a dressing style and appearance should have been that of a harmless and lovely girl, but in reality, this girl was actually Chen Ruyan, the Water Attribute Primeval Origin Ancestor who had cultivated the Water Attribute Law to its extreme, one of the Seven Lords of the Heavenly Court.

She and Chi Rong, on the other hand, were like fire and water, with a strong sense of opposition and conflict. It was not a matter of friction between two different paths, but rather a natural aversion between two different paths, which would lead to confrontation as soon as they met.

The girl did not look at Chi Rong, and Chi Rong did not look at the girl, as if they were mutually exclusive, like water and fire.

On the other side of Chi Rong, there was a short, thin old man with a pale complexion. Today, he was not wearing his usual coarse linen clothes, but instead wore a purple and gold Daoist robe, which was adorned with strange and dazzling threads. It was clear that this was a Daoist robe of the highest quality.

The old man's shoulders were still slightly hunched, but his eyes were bright and piercing, and he was none other than Li Yuanji, the Master of the Nine Yuan Observatory.

On the other side, Chen Ruyan was accompanied by a tall, dark figure clad in a black robe, which even covered his face, revealing only a pair of deep, purple eyes that seemed to contain countless stars and twinkling lights. This person was named Yin Ming, one of the most mysterious and unknown of the Seven Lords of the Heavenly Court.

While Chen Poyuan had long since disappeared from the world, his reputation still lingered, and even the highest-ranking cultivators of the Heavenly Court did not know much about him.

In reality, Chen Poyuan had been crippled by the Heavenly Dao, and Xuan Yuan Jie had been killed by Han Li and Jin Tong. The Seven Lords of the Heavenly Court, apart from these five, were no longer present.

The past Bodhi Banquet, except for the occasional appearance of the ancient or modern, the other Seven Lords of the Heavenly Court rarely appeared. Especially the black-robed man, who had suddenly appeared with five others, was already a rare sight.

As these people appeared, almost all the cultivators present stood up to pay their respects.

The direct disciples of the Heavenly Court were even more eager to call out: "Greetings, Your Excellency!"

The ancient or modern smiled and nodded, saying: "Cangwu Dao friend, today the host is a guest, so don't spoil the ceremony."

His words were not warning, but rather a gentle reminder.

However, after this seemingly light remark, Cangwu Zhenjun indeed retracted his hand and returned to his seat, his expression even more worn and tired.

The host of the Wheel of Reincarnation looked at the ancient or modern and the others, his eyes calm and his expression serene.

Qing Qiu Zhenren let out a sigh of relief and led him forward, coming to the front row of seats where Cangwu Zhenjun and the other Dao ancestors were sitting.

"Host, this is the seat arranged for you, please take a seat," Qing Qiu Zhenren said.

The host of the Wheel of Reincarnation glanced at the seat, laughed loudly, and stepped over the table, coming to the middle seat between the two rows of seats.

He suddenly curved his fingers and grasped one of the seven tables, pulling it back with a burst of energy.

The table and the cushion behind it were swept away, landing in front of the host of the Wheel of Reincarnation.

"Since the person is not here, why leave the seat empty? Isn't it a bit inauspicious?" the host of the Wheel of Reincarnation laughed and said.

After speaking, the host of the Wheel of Reincarnation sat down, picked up a jug of celestial wine from the table, poured it into a cup, and gently swirled it.

The entire hall was in an uproar at this sight.

Qing Qiu Zhenren's cold sweat, which had just been repressed, began to flow again.

However, in his heart, he was somewhat impressed by the host of the Wheel of Reincarnation, who could still display such a domineering attitude in this environment. It was likely that no one else could do this.

But despite his admiration, he had to persuade the host, saying: "Host, this is not reasonable."

The host of the Wheel of Reincarnation ignored him, downing the wine in one gulp.

"No need to worry, it's just a small matter," the ancient or modern said with a smile.

Since the Dao ancestors had spoken, the others naturally did not have any further opinions. Qing Qiu Zhenren bid farewell and left the hall, returning to the Eastern Victory Continent.

The ancient or modern and the others took their seats, but not next to each other.

As the leader of the Seven Lords of the Heavenly Court, the ancient or modern naturally sat in the central position, and his table was slightly higher than the others.

Next to him on the left was the black-robed Dao ancestor, Yin Ming, while the right side was empty, where Chen Poyuan should have been sitting.

Further to the left, next to Yin Ming's seat, was the girl Dao ancestor, Chen Ruyan, and on her left, the seat was empty, and even the table had been moved away by the host of the Wheel of Reincarnation, where Xuan Yuan Jie should have been sitting.

On the right side, next to Chen Poyuan's empty seat, was Chi Rong, and next to him was the Master of the Nine Yuan Observatory.

After these people sat down, the cultivators who had stood up to pay their respects finally took their seats, and the entire hall began to play celestial music, and the atmosphere gradually became more relaxed.

At this time, a figure surrounded by layers of dense white cloud energy appeared in front of everyone.
When the clouds dissipated, a tall figure emerged, dressed in a sky-blue long robe with snow-white cloud patterns embroidered on it. This was none other than Bai Yun Dao Zu, the one responsible for overseeing the operation of the Heavenly Court.

"Today is the Bodhi Banquet, and I cordially invite all guests to come and share in the blessings of the immortals. I hope you will all enjoy yourselves," Bai Yun Dao Zu said, first bowing to Gu Yu and others, then turning to the rest of the crowd with a loud laugh.

As soon as his words fell, a seven-colored cloud mist suddenly appeared above the crowd's heads, with dozens of fairy maidens dressed in rainbow-colored robes and feathered clothes, dancing and swaying to the music. The beauty was breathtaking.

The crowd watched in rapt attention, temporarily relaxing and enjoying the immortal brew and spiritual fruits.

...

Deep within the endless void, a massive silver mountain peak floated in the air, towering above the void. The mountain peak was formed from a crystal-clear silver mineral, each piece emitting spatial law fluctuations. If someone with knowledge were to see this, they would immediately recognize it as the legendary Void Crystal Stone, containing the power of spatial laws.

The spatial law fluctuations from the mountain peak converged to form a powerful and unmatched spatial law fluctuation, as if it could shake the entire void.

The chaotic void around the mountain peak became calm and peaceful, flowing smoothly past the mountain.

At the base of the mountain, a massive black tortoise was visible, its enormous body supporting the silver mountain peak on its back. The tortoise's four limbs moved slowly, carrying the silver mountain peak through the void.

On the mountain peak, numerous small caves were distributed, each containing a network of tunnels and passageways that stretched far and wide, as if the mountain peak had been hollowed out. Each tunnel had stone rooms built along its length, with countless rooms throughout the mountain peak.

The stone rooms were connected by thick silver threads, forming a complex network that linked the entire mountain peak. Some of the silver threads extended into the void, disappearing into the distance.

The silver threads pulsed with energy, as if transmitting something. Each stone room contained several transmission arrays, different from ordinary transmission arrays, which were used to transmit objects.

The arrays hummed with energy, occasionally spewing out various objects. The people from the Wheel of Rebirth Temple stood guard beside the arrays, transmitting the objects to other arrays or handing them over to nearby puppets.

The puppets received the objects and quickly delivered them to other parts of the mountain peak. The silver mountain peak seemed like a vast and bustling country, with a complex yet orderly operation.

At the peak of the mountain, a grand hall stood. Inside the hall, four enormous furnaces were placed, each over a hundred feet tall, almost reaching the ceiling. The furnaces were identical in style but differed in color: blue, green, red, and black.

The furnaces were surrounded by dozens of cultivators, most of whom wore masks from the Wheel of Rebirth Temple. Some wore purple robes, the attire of the Night Sun Kingdom.

The cultivators were constantly manipulating the furnaces, adding rare materials to the flames. The furnaces slowly rotated, emitting a low rumbling sound.

The blue furnace suddenly shook, and a blue glow shot out. A tall, masked man from the Wheel of Rebirth Temple caught the glow and revealed a blue rabbit-shaped mask.

The man examined the mask, nodded, and walked to a side hall. Inside, three stone pedestals stood, each with a cultivator seated on it, holding a white jade board with flashing text.

The three cultivators were busy browsing the text and manipulating the jade boards. The leftmost cultivator was a middle-aged man in gray robes, with a thin face and sunken eyes, looking somewhat gloomy.

The central cultivator was an old man in purple robes, likely from the Night Sun Kingdom. He had a slightly hunched back, sparse hair, and wrinkled skin, but his spirit was vigorous.

The rightmost cultivator was a white-robed woman with pale skin and beautiful features, but her expression was cold and detached.

The three cultivators had enormous auras, having reached the Mahayana realm. The old man in purple robes had the highest cultivation, having reached the peak of the Mahayana middle period, only one step away from the Mahayana late period.
