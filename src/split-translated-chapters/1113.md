“Wǔ Xíng Yān Kōng Dà Zhèn! Quick, don't let them activate this array!” Jiao San exclaimed, his face turning pale with shock as he overheard Dao Yin Zhenren and Qi Mozi's conversation.

As he spoke, his body's dark red glow intensified, and he forced his way through the turbulent air currents, charging towards the five-colored light pillars.

Han Li and Huo San, although they had never heard of the Wǔ Xíng Yān Kōng Dà Zhèn's name, saw Jiao San's frantic state and immediately followed him.

Dao Yin Zhenren coldly smiled, not showing any concern, and waved his hand holding the golden talisman.

In an instant, the Years God Lamp's flame surged once more, and the nine golden dragons reappeared, rapidly growing several dozen times larger, transforming into nine massive dragons that charged towards Han Li and the others.

Han Li and the others had just witnessed the golden dragons' power and hastily dodged.

Jiao San's mouth curled into a sly smile, and he let out a soft cry, waving his right hand.

A yellow glow shot out from his hand, a large earth-yellow seal, flying through the gaps between the nine dragons, and in an instant, it appeared before the five jade pillars.

Jiao San rapidly recited incantations, his jade finger pointing into the air.

A deafening boom echoed, and the earth-yellow seal burst forth with an astonishing spiritual pressure, while radiating countless earth-yellow rays, dazzling and difficult to gaze upon. Moreover, layer upon layer of mysterious yellow symbols swirled around its surface.

As the symbols flashed and disappeared, merging into the seal's body, the seal rapidly expanded, instantly transforming into a massive yellow seal the size of a small mountain, occupying nearly half of the hall's space, and with a force of a thousand pounds, it crashed towards the five jade pillars.

Compared to the earth-yellow seal, the originally thick five jade pillars now seemed like five chopsticks.

“Huang Tian Hou Tu Yin… unfortunately, you used it in the wrong place.” Dao Yin Zhenren's face remained calm, his fingers forming a seal, pointing at the yellow jade pillar.

The light pillar on the yellow jade pillar immediately split off, striking the earth-yellow seal.

The seal's surface radiance let out a "hiss" as it suddenly vanished.

The massive seal's size rapidly shrank, and in an instant, it returned to its original size, flying into the yellow light pillar, hovering above the yellow-faced old man's head, spinning rapidly.

“What!” Jiao San's eyes widened as he witnessed this scene, his face changing color.

“Hmph! The five immortal artifacts you took away were originally part of this array. Why else would we let you take them away so easily? Now, they're all back!” Dao Yin Zhenren's face revealed a cold smile as he glanced at the others, his hand slapping the five-colored round plate.

The five-colored round plate suddenly lit up, and the surrounding five-colored light pillars also lit up, rotating and flashing, emitting a summoning intent.

The giant mountain's massive ancient sword in Xiong Shan's hand suddenly radiated a brilliant golden light, shooting out with a "whoosh" sound, flying towards the gold-colored light pillar of the Wǔ Xíng Yān Kōng Dà Zhèn, despite Xiong Shan's attempts to control it.

The blue-colored small pouch in Lan Yan's hand also lit up, radiating countless blue lights, suddenly escaping his control, flying towards the blue-colored light pillar.

Almost simultaneously, the storage artifact on Lan Yuanzi's body flashed with a green light, and a two-foot-long emerald green staff suddenly appeared, flying towards the Wǔ Xíng Yān Kōng Dà Zhèn.

Han Li's fingers suddenly felt a surge of heat, and the next moment, a white glow appeared beside him, the white fireball floating in mid-air, rapidly flying towards the front.

His face sank, and his large hand grasped at the air.

A deafening boom echoed, and a golden giant palm appeared above the fireball, grasping at it, but the fireball's surface radiance suddenly intensified, and seven or eight white fire columns shot out, piercing the golden palm, and then rapidly twisting.

A faint "hiss" sound echoed, and the golden palm was easily torn apart, disintegrating into countless golden lights.

This series of changes occurred in an instant, and the white fireball barely paused before disappearing into the red light pillar.

The other three immortal artifacts also flew into the gold, blue, and green light pillars, hovering above Lei Yu Ce's head, spinning rapidly.

With the power of the five immortal artifacts, the five-colored light pillars lit up once more, radiating a terrifying law fluctuation.

Dao Yin Zhenren's face remained calm, his hand dropping the golden talisman, and he spat out several mouthfuls of essence blood, merging them into the five-colored round plate.

At the same time, his hands formed a wheel-like seal, and a torrent of incantations shot out, entering the five-colored round plate.

Lei Yu Ce and the others also spat out essence blood, merging them into the immortal artifacts above their heads, their bodies radiating dazzling lights, pouring into the immortal artifacts.

As Dao Yin Zhenren cast his spell, the five-colored round plate radiated a frantic flash of light, and then suddenly dimmed.

The surrounding five-colored light pillars also entwined each other, merging into a five-colored ball-shaped light screen, enveloping the altar and the people within.

This series of changes seemed complex, but it was completed in just a few breaths, and Han Li and the others were unable to intervene, everything was already over.

At this moment, a dramatic change occurred outside the Years Temple!

The five array eyes on the giant peak emitted a deafening boom, each shooting out a massive light pillar, far thicker than the ones inside the Years Temple, resembling five giant pillars supporting the heavens, piercing the sky.
The sky's cloud layer immediately began to churn and surge, and the seventh layer of space also started to rumble and shake.

The primordial energy of the heavens and earth surged, like a tidal wave, towards the five pillars of light that held up the sky.

A gigantic, five-colored sphere of light, with the five pillars of light at its center, slowly emerged, enveloping the sky and the towering peaks below.

A massive and powerful energy emanated from the sphere of light, causing the surrounding void to shatter and collapse with a mere ripple.

Meanwhile, inside the Temple of the Ages, the storm that had been raging within had finally subsided, and all the fluctuations in the primordial energy had been absorbed into the five-colored sphere of light.

The sphere of light displayed a series of five-colored spiritual patterns, emitting a soft, gentle glow that seemed to lack any killing intent, as if it were a ordinary seal.

However, Han Li's gaze as he looked at the sphere of light was extremely solemn, and he felt a sense of trepidation.

The storage device in his possession, the Tianyan Sword Diagram, suddenly burst into radiant light, emitting a low hum as it faced the sphere of light, as if it were challenging it.

Han Li sensed the anomaly in his storage device, but he didn't have time to worry about it, given the urgent situation.

"Jiao San, you seem to be familiar with the Five Elements Void Array, what exactly is this formation?" Han Li asked, his voice barely audible to the three of them.

Hou San also turned to look at Han Li.

"The Five Elements Void Array is one of the Ten Great Ancient Formations, which has long been lost to the ages, so very few people know about it. I didn't expect to find one here. Although this formation appears incomplete, using the power of the five artifacts to improvise, it's still extremely powerful, and I fear we can't withstand it," Jiao San said, his face grim.

"What should we do? Are we going to be killed by that bull-nosed fiend?" Hou San asked anxiously.

"We can only fight to the death!" Jiao San said, his expression grave.

Hou San's face turned pale as he heard Jiao San's words.

Han Li's expression was also solemn, but he didn't seem to be despairing. He looked around, his mind racing with thoughts.

It was clear that Dao Yin intended to go all out, killing everyone, including the demonic beasts, and even Qi Mozi, in this place. However, Han Li didn't think that Qi Mozi and the five demonic beasts would really surrender.

If they could work together, the problem would be much easier to solve, but Dao Yin had already seen the situation and knew that the people present wouldn't cooperate.

"Qi Mozi, didn't you say you could control the Five Elements Void Array and the Temple of the Ages? What's going on?" the White Bone Demon asked, his voice cold and menacing.

The other demonic beasts also glared at Qi Mozi, except for the Eagle-Nosed Demon, who seemed calm.

Qi Mozi's expression turned dark, but he didn't speak.

The other demonic beasts had been confident in their abilities, and they had followed Qi Mozi to this place, expecting to easily kill Han Li and the others, and plunder their treasures.

Qi Mozi had promised to give them half of the treasures, but things hadn't turned out as expected.

The Blue Yuanzi and Blue Yan looked at the five-colored sphere of light and immediately retreated to a safe distance, but they didn't approach Han Li or Qi Mozi, seeming to distrust them.

Inside the sphere of light, Dao Yin had stopped casting his spell.

His face was pale, as if he had consumed a lot of primordial energy, but his expression was excited and frenzied, as he gazed at the five-colored sphere of light.

Dao Yin's gaze turned towards Han Li and the others, and a cruel smile spread across his face. He raised his hand, and the five-colored sphere of light burst into radiance.

A series of circular patterns appeared on the surface of the sphere, and countless orbs of light shot out, striking the people inside the temple with the force of a thunderbolt.

Each orb of light flashed with five-colored light, and each color emitted a force of the five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The five elements clashed fiercely, but didn't explode, instead emitting a deafening roar that shook the temple and made everyone's ears ache.

The people inside the temple turned pale, and they hastily set up their defenses.

The five demonic beasts, including the Eagle-Nosed Demon, the Copper Lion Demon, the White Bone Demon, the Blood Hand Demon, and the Turtle-Backed Demon, unleashed their black energy, revealing their true forms, and cast their spiritual domains.

The five black domains intertwined, forming a black, oval-shaped array, with the five demons sitting at its center. This was the Four Symbols Domain Array, their ultimate technique.

The array was incredibly powerful, with countless black lightning bolts, dark flames, and black symbols swirling within, making it nearly indestructible.

Moreover, the five demons spat out numerous, colorful magical artifacts, each emitting a powerful magical energy that flew around the array, increasing its might.

The Eagle-Nosed Demon and the others seemed to be angry at Qi Mozi for not keeping his promise, and they didn't include him in their array, leaving him outside.

Qi Mozi's expression turned dark, but he didn't speak.

The Blue Yuanzi and Blue Yan stood at a distance, watching the scene unfold, but they didn't approach Han Li or Qi Mozi, seemingly distrustful of them.

The five-colored sphere of light continued to radiate energy, and the people inside the temple were on the verge of collapse.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he thought of a plan.
