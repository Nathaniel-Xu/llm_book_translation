The Qingshou tribe people were shocked and dismayed, but their minds were resolute. They couldn't let their tribe's reputation be tarnished, and they wouldn't be able to show their faces to their tribe members if they lost.

Just then, a loud roar erupted from the Qingshou tribe person's mouth, and his eyes flashed with a fierce light. His two sharp horns suddenly extended, and his muscles began to bulge rapidly. His body expanded to twice its original size, and a crimson mist emanated from his fists, containing a power that had increased tenfold.

"Die...!" the Qingshou tribe person roared, his massive fist pressing down on Han Li.

Han Li's body was forced to crouch down, but he suddenly flashed a fierce light in his eyes. His feet, which had been deeply buried in the ground, suddenly kicked out, and he shot upwards like a lightning bolt, directly breaking through the Qingshou tribe person's fist.

His body flashed once, and he appeared in the high air, his arms spread wide like an eagle's wings.

The next instant, a loud thunderclap boomed, and a silver lightning bolt descended from the sky, striking the Qingshou tribe person with incredible force. The Qingshou tribe person, who had just stabilized his body, looked up to see a massive silver winged creature descending from the sky, its body as large as a mountain, and its lightning-filled aura directly striking him.

The impact was immense, and the Qingshou tribe person was sent flying to the ground, his body battered by countless lightning bolts. His skin was torn and charred, and he lay motionless on the ground.

Han Li, who had released the attack, suddenly contracted his body, returning to his human form. He stood beside his beast cart, his face expressionless, gazing at the Qingshou tribe person who lay on the ground.

The Qingshou tribe person, despite his severe injuries, was not seriously hurt, a testament to the strength of his tribe's collective spirit.

Han Li had not intended to kill him, and now that the Qingshou tribe person had been thoroughly defeated, he was satisfied.

The Qingshou tribe person struggled to get up, his body numb, and his eyes filled with shock and incredulity.

The surrounding crowd erupted in cheers and jeers, ridiculing the Qingshou tribe person and admiring Han Li. Even the usually stoic Santu and Yun Bao were excited, their faces filled with admiration for Han Li.

It was clear that they saw Han Li as a formidable opponent, capable of easily defeating the Qingshou tribe person, who was known for his strength.

Han Li, seeing that the Qingshou tribe person was no longer a threat, turned to leave, but just then, the crowd's jeers stopped, and Han Li's brow furrowed.

A new figure emerged from the city gate, a Qingshou tribe person clad in reddish-brown armor, his upper body exposed. He was larger than the previous Qingshou tribe person, and his aura was more stable, comparable to that of a Taizong peak cultivator.

"Qingshou, you're a waste, and you've disgraced our tribe," the new Qingshou tribe person said, his voice hoarse.

"Brother, I..."

"Shut up!" The new Qingshou tribe person slapped the previous one, sending him flying.

"Brother, is that... isn't that the newly emerged bloodline of the Qingshou tribe, the one who's said to be the purest inheritor of the Zhu Yan bloodline?" someone exclaimed.

"That's right, that's Qingshou Tian, the next leader of the Qingshou tribe!" another person shouted.

"Hehe, this is going to be interesting!"

"Shh, be quiet, I've heard that Qingshou Tian has a bad temper, and if you don't want to get killed, you should be careful."

Han Li listened to the surrounding chatter, his brow furrowed in concern.

"My brother may be a waste, but he's not someone who can be easily defeated. Since he can't restore our tribe's reputation, I'll do it myself. Do you want to settle this with a fight or a duel to the death?" Qingshou Tian asked, his expression calm.

Han Li's heart sank, thinking that he had just defeated the smaller Qingshou tribe person, and now the larger one had appeared. Would he have to fight the older one next?
Han Li was getting impatient, unable to bear the endless nagging. 

"Alright, let's get straight to the point. How do you want to die?" Seeing Han Li remain silent, Qing Dian added, his arm muscles tensing, his veins bulging.

Han Li's eyes narrowed slightly, his expression suddenly turning cold.

He stood with his hands behind his back, his sleeves rustling softly as small, silver electrical arcs danced within.

The surrounding crowd had fallen silent, their attention focused on the two of them, eager to see how many moves Qing Dian, the rumored next patriarch of the Qing Yuan tribe, could use to defeat the young man from the Lei Peng tribe.

Sang Tu and Yun Bao, in particular, were holding their breath, their foreheads sweating as they hesitated over whether to take advantage of the situation to slip away.

After all, in their opinion, Han Li was strong, but he was no match for the future patriarch of the Qing Yuan tribe. If they, the two small tribes, were to offend him, they might not be able to escape unscathed.

Just as the atmosphere at the city gate was tense, with conflict imminent, a clear, melodious voice suddenly broke the silence: "Hey, brother, isn't that Stone Brother?"

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise as he turned to look towards the entrance.

A beautiful young girl, dressed in a snow-white short skirt, was jumping towards him, her face radiant with a natural charm that made everyone present swallow their saliva.

Even Qing Dian was momentarily entranced by the girl's beauty.

However, the girl's eyes shone with a pure, innocent light, filled with a smile that was solely for Han Li.

"Le'er..." Han Li's eyebrows arched as he smiled, calling out to her.

The next instant, a fragrant breeze wafted through the air, and Han Li's arms were filled with a soft, boneless body.

The surrounding crowd watched, their eyes widening in envy, as their earlier goodwill towards Han Li vanished.

The girl, of course, was none other than Liu Le'er, the little fox who had accompanied Han Li in the Ling Huan realm.

"Brother, why did you come here without telling me? I would have gone to welcome you!"

Han Li held her shoulders, pushing her back slightly as he looked her up and down, nodding in approval.

Le'er's face flushed as she remembered the past, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

This scene only added to the crowd's infatuation, as they watched the girl who seemed to have cast a spell on them without even trying.

"Where did this little girl come from? Get out of the way!" Qing Dian snapped, his anger rising.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, his temper flaring up in response.

Just as he was about to step forward to resolve the situation, Le'er reached out and grasped his arm, pulling him back.

Then, she stepped forward, curtsying elegantly to Qing Dian.

"Sir, you must be a friend of the Qing Yuan tribe. Do you recognize this object?" Le'er asked, her hand flipping over to reveal a palm-sized, round scale.

Qing Dian's eyes widened as he stared at the scale, his face paling.

Han Li's eyes scanned the scale, noticing the intricate patterns etched into its surface, and his eyebrows arched in surprise.

He realized that the scale was identical to the one Li Qi Mu had given him when they parted ways after leaving the Sui Yue Tower.

The surrounding crowd gasped, recognizing the scale as they bowed in unison, some even prostrating themselves on the ground.

Qing Dian's voice trembled as he asked, "Is this...the True Spirit King's token? How did you obtain it?"

Le'er smiled, her eyes sparkling with amusement.

"Not bad, sir. I am indeed a member of the Tian Hu tribe."

Han Li's eyes narrowed, his mind racing with questions.

"Le'er, what is this scale? It seems to be extremely rare..."

Le'er's voice whispered in his ear, "Brother, this is the True Spirit King's token, a symbol of his trust. There are only seven of these scales in existence, and our tribe has been honored with one. Our ancestor has always cherished me, and so I carry it with me."

Han Li's eyes widened in surprise, his mind reeling with the implications. Why had Li Qi Mu given him such a valuable object?
