Here is the translated text:

 Gu Huo Jin smiled faintly, his hands suddenly moving swiftly to form a complex pattern on his forehead, which resembled a formation array.

The pattern was formed by nine different colored runes, radiating nine different colors of light, each containing a different law of power.

The nine colors of light intertwined, the nine different laws of power not only did not conflict, but also subtly merged.

The nine colors of light contained a very peculiar aura, somewhat similar to the power of the Heavenly Way, but also different.

With a loud "boom", the dazzling nine colors of light burst forth from Gu Huo Jin's body, expanding in all directions.

Gu Huo Jin's movements were too fast, and the Wheel of Reincarnation's master and others wanted to stop him, but it was too late.

The nine colors of light swept over the four people, and they hastily used their magic to defend themselves, but the nine colors of light simply passed over them, seemingly without any intention of attacking them.

"What did you do?" the Demon Master's face turned stern.

As he spoke, his body emitted a burst of silver light, and he was about to take action.

The Wheel of Reincarnation's master's eyebrows furrowed, and his body's dark red light flashed.

At this moment, two slightly painful cries came from the side, from Li Yuan Yu and Chi Rong.

The two of them now had nine-colored patterns on their foreheads, and a thread of nine-colored light was spreading rapidly across their bodies.

In the blink of an eye, their bodies were covered in nine-colored light.

Their hands moved swiftly to form hand seals, and their bodies emitted a burst of golden light and crimson flames, rising and falling with the nine colors of light.

The nine colors of light seemed to be trying to control the laws of power within their bodies, but Li Yuan Yu and Chi Rong were, after all, Dao Ancestors, with profound cultivation and not controlled.

However, as they struggled, they lost control of the laws of power, and their divine abilities were greatly reduced.

At this moment, two golden shadows flashed before them, and two golden giant palms appeared, bringing a series of residual shadows, rapidly slapping towards their heads.

Gu Huo Jin had made his move!

Li Yuan Yu and Chi Rong had no chance to dodge, and were about to be hit, when suddenly, a sharp, piercing cry came from the side, and two dark red lights intercepted the golden giant palms, blocking them. It was the Wheel of Reincarnation's master who had intervened.

The two clashed, and with a loud "boom", the dark red light was shattered, but the golden giant palms were delayed for a moment.

Li Yuan Yu and Chi Rong's bodies were enveloped in a vacuum, and they were sucked in, disappearing into thin air.

The golden giant palms struck down, but hit nothing.

Hundreds of miles away, the vacuum fluctuated, and Li Yuan Yu and Chi Rong reappeared, with the Demon Master and the Wheel of Reincarnation's master appearing beside them.

"Are you two alright?" the Demon Master asked, looking warily at Gu Huo Jin from afar.

"The mark on our foreheads is trying to control the laws of power within our bodies. I don't know what it is or when it entered my body." Li Yuan Yu said, struggling to resist the nine-colored light.

Chi Rong did not speak, but his situation was clearly no different from Li Yuan Yu's.

"This is the Dao God Seal!" the Wheel of Reincarnation's master exclaimed, looking closely at the nine-colored patterns on Li Yuan Yu's forehead.

"What?! The Dao God Seal is a divine ability used to resist the Heavenly Way's invasion!" Chi Rong's face turned pale.

"Correct, this is the Dao God Seal, but I've made some modifications. Master, I don't know how you knew about the Dao God Seal, but I'm afraid you didn't expect this situation." Gu Huo Jin's figure flew over, his voice calm.

The Wheel of Reincarnation's master blocked Li Yuan Yu and Chi Rong, about to speak, when his body suddenly trembled, and he turned to look towards the distance.

A series of escaping lights flew over from afar, and it was the cultivators who had left earlier.

At this moment, they all had the same nine-colored patterns on their foreheads, and their bodies were radiating various colors of light, but their faces were filled with terror, clearly unable to control their actions.

The light from their bodies was extremely intense, as if burning their lives, and it gathered into a massive torrent, like a raging storm, striking the demon domain's army from behind.

These cultivators were completely disregarding their physical limits, overloading their divine abilities, and unleashing a level of power far surpassing their normal abilities.

Moreover, they seemed to have gone mad, frantically launching various attacks.

Innumerable divine light beams struck the demon domain's army, causing innumerable casualties, and the cries of the wounded filled the air.

These cultivators from the various immortal realms were originally stronger than the demon domain's army, and now, they were attacking without restraint, and the demon domain's army was caught off guard, quickly becoming disorganized.

The originally intact encirclement was quickly torn apart.

The Heavenly Court's cultivators inside the encirclement saw this scene, and immediately withdrew their formation, joining the maddened cultivators.

The two armies merged, with the maddened cultivators at the forefront, and they charged straight into the demon domain's army, killing without restraint.

The area was filled with blood and white bones.

...

Han Li had just withdrawn the True Word Treasure Wheel, and a wave of purple flames suddenly erupted, instantly transforming into a sea of purple fire that engulfed the surroundings.

Han Li saw that he couldn't avoid it, and his eyebrows furrowed, "I don't have time to waste on you."

He said, and his Great Five Elements Fantastical World technique began to operate, his mouth shouting "Heaven and earth overturned", and his hand struck out.

The formation space, which had just reconnected with the outside world, was suddenly twisted by a strange power, and the flames also reversed, falling upwards.

(Note: I've kept the translation as close to the original as possible, but some minor adjustments were made to improve readability and clarity.)
Here is the translation of the chapter:

A gigantic golden handprint, over a hundred million feet in size, suddenly appeared in the void, like a divine fan, sweeping towards Zhu Yan and the others.

At the same time, the boundless power from the outside world transformed into a massive torrent, surging forward along with the golden handprint.

"Boom, boom, boom..."

As the sound of the void exploding echoed, the entire space of the great array began to shrink layer by layer, finally unable to withstand the pressure, and completely collapsed.

Jintong, who had escaped, returned to her original form and flew back to Han Li's side.

"It seems we're still in the external space..." Jintong quickly scanned the surroundings and said.

Han Li looked at the void in the distance, where the space was cracked like a window, and thought for a moment before saying:

"No wonder this great array was so difficult to break, it's because it gathered the power of ten immortal realms. If those few hadn't entered the array to cause trouble, maybe we wouldn't have been able to escape so soon."

He turned around and glanced at the distant Zishan and the others.

"What do we do?" Zhu Yan asked with a serious expression.

"The great array has been broken, we can't stop him..." Zishan sighed and said.

"But..." Zhu Yan wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Zishan.

"Meng Yuan has fallen, Dong Li is heavily injured, and you and I..." Zishan hesitated for a moment.

"What about us?" Zhu Yan asked urgently.

"You and I are also heavily injured." Zishan gritted his teeth and said.

Zhu Yan understood immediately, and the two of them glanced at Han Li before turning and flying towards one of the space cracks.

Han Li watched them escape without making a move.

"These space cracks are disappearing, what do we do?" Jintong suddenly asked.

Han Li looked around and saw that the ten space cracks were indeed closing, with a few already disappearing.

"We should leave too."

...

The barbarian realm's army was also shocked by the Heavenly Court's sudden and crazy attack, and their originally neat formation began to fall apart.

In the distance, only a few cultivators remained, unaffected by the divine seal.

The three true immortals, including Cangwu, had the divine seal mark on their foreheads, with nine-colored spiritual patterns appearing on their bodies, trying to control their internal laws. The three of them resisted with all their might, frozen in place.

The three of them had their internal laws controlled, but their senses were still intact, and they were shocked by the sudden change in the battlefield.

Guo or Jin had actually hidden this trick, and now the situation was unclear.

The few Dao ancestors who were fighting saw the situation and had different expressions.

The Heavenly Court's Dao ancestor was overjoyed, while the demon realm's four tribes and Bai Ze's face fell.

"I didn't expect the divine seal to have such a use, it's really opened my eyes, but relying on this alone, you think you can turn the tide?" Lunhui, the master of the Wheel of Rebirth, said calmly.

As he spoke, he made a hand seal, and a brilliant light appeared on his forehead.

An invisible chain shot out, disappearing into the gray space above.

The demon king also made a hand seal, and a thick silver light shot out, merging with the chain.

The space above "ripped" apart, and a gray lightning bolt flashed through, followed by a second, third, fourth...

In an instant, hundreds of gray lightning bolts appeared, forming a gray lightning gate.

"What is this?" Guo or Jin saw this and flashed with a strange light before punching out.

A small mountain-sized golden fist shadow appeared, striking the gray lightning gate.

This golden fist shadow had a huge "Wang" character, radiating endless aura, clearly a very powerful divine technique.

The fist shadow had not yet reached, but the massive power had already penetrated the gray lightning gate, pressing down on Lunhui and the others.

The air around them seemed to be sucked dry in an instant, and the four of them felt unable to breathe.

"You focus on the spell, I'll resist for a bit!" the demon king shouted, flying out.

He pointed to the void and said, "Ding!"

Instantly, a vast area of silver light appeared, centered on the demon king, and the fragmented space was restored, becoming a thousand times more stable.

A mysterious and powerful spatial energy fluctuated in the silver light, and everything within a range of tens of thousands of miles was fixed in place, as if frozen.

The golden fist shadow also stopped in its tracks, unable to move.

However, Lunhui and the others, as well as the space around the gray lightning gate, were unaffected, and everything continued as usual.
