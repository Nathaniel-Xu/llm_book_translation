“Don't you know? How can you not know? How can you not know?” Hei Tian Mo Zu shouted loudly at Han Li.

“I know.” A voice suddenly came from beside, and it was Qi Mozi who walked out with a smile.

Before the words had even fallen, Han Li felt a black shadow flash before his eyes.

The next moment, Qi Mozi's shoulders were grabbed by a pair of rough, large hands, and he was lifted up.

Hei Tian Mo Zu appeared beside Qi Mozi in a ghostly manner, faster than anyone's reaction.

Qi Mozi was suddenly covered by a massive power, and with his Da Luo realm cultivation, he was unable to move, his smile frozen on his face, before he quickly regained his composure.

The others only reacted now, and they were shocked, scattering in all directions to get away from Hei Tian Mo Zu.

Han Li escaped from Hei Tian Mo Zu's grasp and retreated with Huo San Jiao and the others.

He secretly breathed a sigh of relief, but his heart was filled with inexplicable worry about Qi Mozi's sudden words.

This disciple of Mi Luo Old Ancestor was cunning and calculative, and since he dared to speak up, it was certainly not a good thing. Hei Tian Mo Zu's mind was unstable, and who knew what kind of abnormal reaction he would have after hearing this?

But Han Li couldn't stop anything, and that old man valued his wife and child greatly. If he said something wrong, the consequences would be unimaginable.

“Do you know where my wife and son are? Tell me quickly!” Hei Tian Mo Zu shook Qi Mozi's shoulders violently, questioning him sternly.

“Your name is Shi Kong Mo, and your wife's name is Jin Ling, right?” Qi Mozi felt his shoulders were about to be crushed, and he forced a smile.

“Shi Kong Mo...” Han Li's heart skipped a beat upon hearing this.

“Yes, you really know! Take me to find them quickly!” Hei Tian Mo Zu's face lit up with excitement, and his hands tightened their grip on Qi Mozi.

“Your cultivation is boundless, and I'm afraid I won't be able to take it. Please release me, and I'll tell you everything.” Qi Mozi was covered in cold sweat, and he quickly spoke.

“Ah, sorry, take me there quickly!” Hei Tian Mo Zu loosened his grip and released Qi Mozi.

“Shi friend, I know where Jin Ling and the others are, but I won't take you there.” Qi Mozi shook his head.

“What? You dare not take me there?” Hei Tian Mo Zu's face changed, and his eyes gleamed with ferocity as he reached out and grasped Qi Mozi's neck.

A powerful, almost tangible killing intent burst forth from his body, and the nearby air trembled violently, as if the surface of the water was disturbed.

Han Li and the others were enveloped by this killing intent, feeling as if they were standing naked in the icy cold, unable to move or resist.

“Shi friend, don't misunderstand, it's not that I don't want to take you there. Your wife and son are currently being suppressed by Chi Tian Xian Domain's Chi Rong Dao Zu. Shi friend, although you're unmatched in the Da Luo realm, you're still not a match for a Dao Zu.” Qi Mozi quickly spoke.

“What? That old woman Chi Rong Dao Zu! She's a fire source Dao Zu, and her power is among the top ten of all Dao Zu. I'm not her match right now.” Hei Tian Mo Zu's face fell, and he seemed to regain some rationality, releasing Qi Mozi.

“Shi friend, don't worry, I've made a deal with Chi Rong Dao Zu. If we bring two things to her, she'll agree to release Jin Ling and your son.” Qi Mozi carefully observed Hei Tian Mo Zu, then continued.

“What things? Tell me! Even if it's twenty things, I'll give them to her!” Hei Tian Mo Zu's face lit up with excitement, and he quickly asked.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and he felt a sense of foreboding.

“They are the Years God Lamp and the 'Great Five Elements Fantasy World' cultivation method. I came to this Tai Sui Xian Fu for the Years God Lamp, and I didn't expect to encounter someone who cultivates the 'Great Five Elements Fantasy World' method. It seems that heaven is helping us, and Jin Ling and the others will be able to escape their predicament.” Qi Mozi glanced at Han Li, then spoke.

Han Li's face changed upon hearing this.

Huo San Jiao and the others also changed their expressions.

“Ah, this Years God Lamp is annoying, and it can't be destroyed. Taking it to exchange is just right.” Hei Tian Mo Zu said, and his body blurred as he appeared beside the Years God Lamp.

The five-colored altar had been destroyed, but the Years God Lamp still floated in mid-air, emitting a golden glow that permeated the surrounding darkness, like a lone light illuminating the darkness.

“Shi friend, do you have a way to take down this lamp?” Qi Mozi asked, startled.

Hei Tian Mo Zu had attacked the Years God Lamp repeatedly, but it remained unmoving.

“Hmph! It's easy for me to take down this lamp. Watch closely!” Hei Tian Mo Zu snorted, and his body transformed into five black shadows, each appearing around the Years God Lamp.

The five black shadows simultaneously reached out, and five black light palms shot out, grabbing at the air and tearing it apart.

“Rip!” The air seemed to tear apart like a curtain, and a circular spatial rift appeared around the Years God Lamp, with a diameter of several dozen meters.

The spatial rift was filled with turbulent, colorful energies that churned and boiled, emitting a deafening roar, like a massive wave crashing against the shore. A powerful suction force also emanated from the rift, pulling everything towards it.

The onlookers retreated in shock, afraid of being sucked into the spatial rift. But the five black shadows of Hei Tian Mo Zu stood beside the rift, seemingly unaffected.
The Years of Godly Light floated in the void, unaffected by the turbulent flow of the void, remaining motionless as the void around it churned and boiled.

In the depths of the void, a network of golden lock-shaped talismans crisscrossed each other, forming a massive golden array that stretched out in all directions, its extent unknown.

At the center of the golden array was the Years of Godly Light.

"This is..." Han Li's eyes widened in surprise as he beheld the golden array.

The others were equally astonished, having never imagined that the Years of Godly Light had such a thing behind it.

The five Black Heaven Demon Ancestors each extended a hand, emitting a light palm that stabilized the void rift, while the other hand formed a knife-like gesture, striking out.

Instantly, five massive black palm shadows shot out, their bodies a deep black, surrounded by a halo of demonic energy. Wherever they passed, there was no fluctuation of elemental energy, no power of the laws, no vitality, no ripple of any kind.

There was only a void, a void that could erode everything.

"Void and infinite, eroding all things... the demonic energy is being used to such an extent!" Qi Mozi's eyes lit up, muttering to himself.

Han Li's heart was stirred as he watched the five black palm shadows. His "Heavenly Executioner's Prison" and "Nine Abyssal Demon Eyes" were both demonic arts, but his use of demonic energy was far inferior to the Black Heaven Demon Ancestors' void-like palms.

If he could also use demonic energy to the same extent as the Black Heaven Demon Ancestors, he would be able to erode the magical instruments wielded by Qi Mozi and the others, gaining a significant advantage in battle.

The five palm shadows struck the golden array, causing the void turbulence along the way to disappear.

The five palm shadows seemed to slow down, and the five Black Heaven Demon Ancestors' hands had just struck out when the palm shadows landed on the five key points of the golden array.

The golden array suddenly erupted in a blinding flash of light, violently shaking.

A loud hissing sound erupted, and the golden and black light burst forth, causing the surrounding void to distort and change shape.

But it seemed that the golden light was no match for the rolling black energy emanating from the palm shadows, which quickly spread and eroded it.

The Years of Godly Light's flame trembled, and then burst forth in a massive, solid golden sea of fire, rolling out in all directions and engulfing the five black palm shadows.

Unfortunately, the golden sea of fire was a step too slow, and the five black palm shadows had already invaded and covered the golden array.

A tearing sound was heard, and the golden array was torn apart, creating five massive openings. The connection between the golden array and the Years of Godly Light was almost completely severed.

The entire golden array flashed violently, then exploded, shattering into countless golden spirit lights.

Outside the Years of Godly Light, the sky turned a deep golden color, and the clouds were also tinged with gold. The powerful fluctuations of the time laws caused the clouds to churn and boil.

The elemental energy of the world was in turmoil, and countless five-colored lights appeared, densely packed and stretching out as far as the eye could see, filling the entire world with an aura of grandeur.

However, the golden light did not last long, quickly fading away and disappearing.

At the same time, the time laws that had been present throughout the seventh layer of the Years of Godly Light also completely disappeared.

The lower six layers were the same, with golden light appearing and then quickly fading away, and the time laws returning to normal. From the outside, the golden flames on the top of the Years of Godly Light jumped and then disappeared.

In the ruins of the Years of Godly Light.

As the golden array collapsed, the Years of Godly Light also shook violently, its time laws and aura still strong, but no longer stable and unshakeable, flying out into the void.

At this moment, one of the Black Heaven Demon Ancestors waved his hand, emitting a black light that wrapped around the Years of Godly Light, pulling it back.

At the same time, the five Black Heaven Demon Ancestors dispersed the five black palm shadows, and retreated.

The massive void rift quickly closed, and the large hall returned to calm.

This entire process, from the Black Heaven Demon Ancestors' attack to the destruction of the Years of Godly Light's defenses and the seizure of the Years of Godly Light, took only two or three breaths.

The Black Heaven Demon Ancestors seemed to have finally revealed their true strength as a Demon Clan cultivator at the peak of the Great Luo Realm.

Han Li, who had been watching in awe, began to believe the seemingly arrogant words of the Black Heaven Demon Ancestors.

Not far away, Lei Yu and the others saw the Years of Godly Light being taken, and their faces turned ashen.

The five Black Heaven Demon Ancestors merged into one, looked at the Years of Godly Light in their hand, and chuckled, then flipped their hand and threw the Years of Godly Light towards Qi Mozi.

Qi Mozi caught the Years of Godly Light, a flash of excitement in his eyes, but it was quickly suppressed.
