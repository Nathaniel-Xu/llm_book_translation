Here is the translation of the chapter:

As the thin Daoist's voice fell, he took a step forward, and his figure vanished in an instant. The next moment, he reappeared outside the East Heaven Gate.

The many soldiers and generals of the Heavenly Court saw him appear, and their minds were immediately at ease.

"Welcome, Qingqiu Old Ancestor..." the army shouted in unison, their voices like a tidal wave, shaking the heavens.

Who would have thought that the unassuming Daoist temple was actually the Heavenly Suppressing Tower of the East Victory Continent, and that the thin Daoist was one of the Dao Ancestors who guarded this place?

"Ah, noble guests have arrived, and I have failed to welcome you from afar. I am truly sorry..." Qingqiu True Person said, not using the usual Daoist etiquette, but instead bowing with his fists.

"No need for such formalities, I am just an evil guest," the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth said with a smile.

"It's just that, according to our previous estimates, we thought that the Lord would attack the South Heaven Gate, or at the very least, the West Heaven Gate. We didn't expect you to come from my East Heaven Gate," Qingqiu True Person said with an embarrassed expression.

"Don't be puzzled, Qingqiu Dao friend," the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth said. "If I were to launch a direct attack on the Heavenly Court, it would be better to attack from those two places. But since I am coming as a guest, even an evil one, I must have the appearance of a guest. It's better to enter from your place."

"Ha ha, it's a good thing I made some preparations earlier. The carriage is already waiting, Lord. Shall we go to the banquet?" Qingqiu True Person said with a smile.

"Thank you," the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth said.

Qingqiu True Person was about to lead the way, but suddenly stopped and turned around to ask, "Lord, don't you need to bring some attendants?"

"Since I am attending the banquet alone, I am sufficient," the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth said with a smile.

"Lord, you are truly a wonderful person. If it weren't for our different positions, I would have liked to invite you to drink a cup with me and make some small talk," Qingqiu True Person said with a laugh.

"I welcome Dao friends like you to my Wheel of Rebirth Palace, and I am not averse to you coming to drink and discuss matters," the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth said seriously.

"If this time, at the Bodhi banquet, your palace can make a mountain-and-sea oath with the Heavenly Court, and we can put an end to our conflicts, I will definitely come to your palace to visit. I hope you won't be displeased," Qingqiu True Person said with a smile.

The Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth did not respond.

The two of them arrived at the magnificent Gate of Heaven, and Qingqiu True Person waved his hand to dispel the powerful seals that had been set up. The seals were immediately lifted, and the two of them entered the gate.

Inside the gate, a magnificent carriage was floating in the air, with eight dragon-headed horses pulling it. The carriage was adorned with gold and jewels, and the horses' eyes shone brightly, their hooves burning with flames.

"Eight Dragon Carriage, this is a high-ranking vehicle," the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth said.

"This is not just a high-ranking vehicle, I wouldn't have had such treatment if I weren't accompanying you, Lord. Today, I am basking in your glory," Qingqiu True Person said.

The two of them boarded the carriage, and only then did they discover that the carriage was much larger on the inside than it appeared on the outside.

Qingqiu True Person let out a soft whistle, and the eight dragon-headed horses began to gallop, heading towards the Heavenly Palace Continent.

The flames under their hooves surged, and the carriage disappeared into the distance, leaving behind a trail of fire.

 Inside the carriage, only the two of them sat facing each other.

"To be honest, I am a bit puzzled," Qingqiu True Person said. "You have deployed your troops outside the Heavenly Gate, but you are attending the banquet alone. Are you planning to fight or make peace?"

"Guess, Qingqiu Dao friend," the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth said with a smile.

"Lord, if you say so, then we can't talk about it anymore," Qingqiu True Person said with a sigh.

"Qingqiu Dao friend, where is the main venue of the Bodhi banquet?" the Lord of the Wheel of Rebirth asked.

Qingqiu True Person hesitated for a moment before answering, "The main venue is in the Heavenly Palace Continent, as usual. But this time, there are too many people, and we have added several sub-venues on other continents. My East Victory Continent also has one. After I send you to the Heavenly Palace Continent, I will have to return to host the banquet on my own. It's a lot of work."

"So, the entire Middle Realm is the venue for the Bodhi banquet..."

...

Several days later, in the Dragon Abyss Realm, on the Qingyuan Continent.

A vast expanse of sea stretched out, with dark clouds covering the sky, pressing down on the sea surface. The wind howled, and the waves crashed against the shore.

A golden light flashed across the sea, and a magnificent spirit boat appeared, with symbols shining brightly on its surface. The boat was surrounded by a dense aura of spiritual energy.

...
At the front of the Spirit Ship stood a young man dressed in a long, cyan robe, his physique tall and majestic, his features ordinary, but his eyes gleaming with an inner light, his entire body radiating an inexplicable aura.

This was none other than Han Li, who had already completed his third Corpse Severing.

According to normal cultivation, once one completes three Corpse Severings, they should begin to merge with the Dao, step by step completing the process of merging with the Dao, ultimately achieving the position of Dao Ancestor.

However, Han Li's cultivation of the Time Law was already a solitary path, and with the Time Dao Ancestor already standing on this path, it blocked his way forward.

Thus, Han Li's current situation was somewhat awkward, he could feel the connection between himself and the River of Time, which represented the flow of time, growing stronger, but he couldn't feel the sensation of merging with the Heavenly Dao.

Behind him stood two women who looked like celestial beings, naturally, they were Nangong Wan and Jintong.

"Since I've already been rescued, why is he still going to the Heavenly Court?" Nangong Wan's brow furrowed, her expression strange.

Han Li knew she was referring to the Master of the Wheel of Reincarnation, and replied:

" Gan Jiuzhen only sent this message over, without revealing anything else, it's likely his intention."

"You mean, he deliberately didn't let you know his plans?" Nangong Wan asked, her puzzlement growing.

"I'm just guessing... the Wheel of Reincarnation and the Heavenly Court have been at odds for years, with each side having their own informants, I shouldn't follow the Wheel of Reincarnation's actions, it's better for me to act on my own." Han Li hesitated for a moment before speaking.

Nangong Wan listened and roughly understood Han Li's meaning, nodding her head.

"Jintong, you really don't need to follow me, now that Xuan Yuan Jie is dead, your revenge is already fulfilled. This journey is uncertain, it's not necessary to get involved again." Han Li's gaze passed over Nangong Wan, falling on Jintong's figure, as he spoke.

"The year Xuan Yuan Jie destroyed my clan was a decision made by the Heavenly Court as a whole, killing him alone doesn't count as avenging my clan." Jintong's face was expressionless, her voice calm.

In reality, she was willing to follow Han Li because she wanted to repay a debt of gratitude.

However, now that she had regained her Dao Ancestor position, her strength was extraordinary, so Han Li didn't worry about her safety, and instead, she was a great help to him, so he didn't try to persuade her further.

Han Li nodded noncommittally, not speaking further.

In the blink of an eye, the Spirit Ship had flown over several tens of thousands of miles, finally leaving behind the dark, cloudy sea region, the sky in front of them suddenly brightening, the sea and sky regaining their azure color.

Han Li's eyes gazed into the distance, seeing a pair of seagulls flying down from above, his expression suddenly changing.

"Bad...!" he instinctively pulled Nangong Wan behind him, shouting.

As soon as his words fell, the sea region in front of them suddenly changed!

The originally clear sky suddenly turned dark, a massive silver light column descended from the heavens, striking the sea surface in an instant, directly causing a massive tsunami.

Immediately after, four figures suddenly shot out from the silver light, landing in the four directions, surrounding Han Li and the others.

Among them, the one in the east was a tall, purple-robed woman, her features exquisite, but her expression icy, holding a silver mirror the size of a palm, with a black symbol glowing on its surface.

Opposite her in the west was a black-armored, bearded man, his physique sturdy, his face ferocious, his eyes flashing with a faint yellow light, his mouth bearing two protruding fangs, looking unlike a human, his hand also holding a silver mirror, its shape identical to the purple-robed woman's.

The ones who landed in the south and north were an old woman with white hair and a stooped back, and a white-haired man who looked like a child.

The old woman's face was quite ugly, with wrinkles and scars, her eyes, however, were clear.

The white-haired man, although looking like a child, had eyes that were deep and profound, like a well, as if one glance would draw you in, and then you would fall into endless darkness.

These two people also held silver mirrors, identical to the first two.

What was even more shocking was that the auras of these four people were all at the Dao Ancestor level.

"You first return to the Flower Branch Cave Heaven." Han Li waved his hand, opening the silver light door, saying.

"Be careful..." Nangong Wan's expression was complex, warning him before stepping into the cave heaven.

Jintong's face didn't show any fear, her eyes coldly scanning the four people, as she spoke to Han Li:

"Four Dao Ancestors acting together, such a big commotion, do you think they're after you, or after me?"

"Now isn't the time for jokes, their mirrors have something strange, we need to get out of here quickly." Han Li's voice was dry, his smile forced.

"Then let's break their mirrors..."

Jintong's words hadn't finished when her figure suddenly disappeared without warning.

The next moment, in front of the bearded man in black armor, a dazzling golden light exploded, Jintong's figure emerging from it.

She didn't say a word, her hands probing forward, a golden vortex appearing, emitting a devouring force.

...
