The Grand Jin Yuan Immortal Realm, Jiuyuan Observation.

A continuous range of mountains, like a dragon lying on its back, stood tall and proud, with majestic peaks rising high into the air.

Among the hundreds of peaks of varying shapes and sizes, there was one solitary peak that was not particularly high, but its scenery was exceptionally beautiful, shrouded in mist and clouds, with a hint of greenery visible, like a pipa hiding its face, evoking a thousand thoughts.

On this solitary peak, there were four snow-white waterfalls cascading down from the front, back, and right sides, flowing straight down three thousand feet, like the Milky Way descending from the heavens, splashing out waves of water that resembled a thousand pearls, and in the high air, three seven-colored flying rainbows appeared, resplendent and dazzling.

In the mountains, the sounds of apes crying out echoed back and forth, and in the high air, one could occasionally see immortal cranes flying in formation, with the air filled with the soft, flowing colors of the aurora, a manifestation of the abundant heavenly energy.

At the peak, there was a circular observation platform protruding from the mountain, where a middle-aged Taoist stood, dressed in a dark green robe, wearing a lotus flower crown.

His posture was upright, his demeanor majestic, with a face that was average in shape, but with a radiant complexion, and a subtle aura of jade-like clarity surrounding him, making one feel that he was a divine being.

At this moment, the man was gazing out at the scenery, but his brow was furrowed, as if he was troubled by some hidden concern.

Just then, an elderly man dressed in a blue robe appeared from the rear of the mountain, his figure slender, his face gaunt, with a white beard hanging from his chin, exuding an air of elegance and refinement.

"Disciple Qingxu, greeting Pure Jun Shishu," the old man said, bowing respectfully.

The middle-aged Taoist, addressed as "Pure Jun Shishu," was known as Pure Jun Zhenren in the immortal realm, and was the closed-door disciple of the founding ancestor of the Jiuyuan Observation, with a high position in the sect and a great reputation in the immortal realm.

Moreover, he was currently in the late stages of the Da Luo cultivation, temporarily holding the position of master of the Jiuyuan Observation.

"You've returned, what's the result of the investigation?" Pure Jun Zhenren asked.

"Reporting to Shishu, the Heaven-Controlling Vessel has indeed reappeared in the immortal realm, and is currently in the possession of a person named Han Li," Qingxu replied.

"Han Li?" Pure Jun Zhenren's brow furrowed, asking.

"This person appears to be from the Beihuan Immortal Realm, and has stayed in the Zhulong Dao for a long time, but it seems that he is actually a cultivator from the lost Xia Nan Zhou Jie, who has ascended to the immortal realm," Qingxu said.

"Ah, to be able to ascend from the lost world, he must be extraordinary, is there a record of his ascension at the Flying Ascension Platform?" Pure Jun Zhenren asked.

"There is... The person who received him was a stone pillar temple cultivator named Gao Sheng, but it seems that he intentionally concealed a lot of information in order to recruit him into their sect, resulting in the records being unclear. Moreover, this person did not enter the stone pillar temple, but instead disappeared during the process of going there," Qingxu said.

"Ah, what happened?" Pure Jun Zhenren asked, puzzled.

"What exactly happened, it's impossible to investigate now, only that after that, this person disappeared for three hundred years, and when he reappeared in the heavenly court's vision, it was during the time of the Zhulong Dao's downfall. From then on, he wandered through multiple immortal realms, and had multiple conflicts with the heavenly court, but somehow managed to escape each time. Recently, he stirred up trouble again, killing the East Lord of the Xiaojin Yuan Immortal Palace, Dongfang Bai," Qingxu said.

"What is his cultivation level?" Pure Jun Zhenren asked, his brow furrowed.

"Taiyi Peak," Qingxu replied.

"A mere Taiyi cultivator, yet he can single-handedly kill his way into an immortal palace, this kind of power and audacity is certainly not ordinary. So, it seems that the likes of She Chan also died at his hands?" Pure Jun Zhenren asked.

"Earlier, when Lanyan Shizhi returned, he reported to the sect that She Chan indeed died at his hands. Later, Miao Fa Shimei personally took action, but was disrupted by Chi Meng, resulting in this person escaping once again. Since then, we have lost track of him, and do not know where he is currently," Qingxu said.

"This matter concerns the Heaven-Controlling Vessel, and must be taken seriously, if we can retrieve it, the significance to our Jiuyuan Observation will be immense," Pure Jun Zhenren said, his brow furrowed.

"Miao Fa Shimei is currently outside searching for him, and has not returned yet, one-third of the Jiuyuan Observation's shadow guards have been arranged to handle this matter, and once this person reveals himself again, he will certainly not be able to escape our notice," Qingxu said.

"Now that the immortal realm is becoming increasingly chaotic, our several immortal realms are not at peace, with the Tianxing Immortal Realm and the Tongzhou Immortal Realm being the most turbulent, the two Shishu are both busy handling the situation, and four of the eight great elders are also away, we must be prepared to prevent any chaos in the immortal realm, and must not disturb the several old ancestors who are in seclusion," Pure Jun Zhenren sighed, saying.

"Shishu, please be at ease, our Jin Yuan Immortal Realm has always been strictly guarded, and is as solid as a rock, who would dare to cause trouble?" Qingxu said.

"Ah, how is that Jin Tongzi?" Pure Jun Zhenren asked.

"At first, he was quite lively, full of energy, but now he has become much more obedient, eating and drinking in the observation, apart from not being able to move freely, he has already considered himself a member of the observation," Qingxu said, a hint of a smile appearing on his face.

"Last time, Shifu investigated him with a secret method, and said that his origins were quite deep, and it seems that he is quite fond of him, so we must be prepared to prevent the old ancestor from treating him as a gift to be given to the Bodhi feast, you should arrange a few more gifts that are suitable for the occasion," Pure Jun Zhenren said.
"Yes." Qing Xu bowed and said.

...

The Barbarian Domain.

A mountain range shrouded in thick fog, with bursts of colorful thunderbolts exploding continuously, causing the heavens and earth to rumble.

The vast cloud sea above was stirred by an immense power, transforming into a massive cloud dragon that descended from the sky, connecting with the fog on the mountain, and pouring into one of the mountain peaks.

In a cave beneath the mountain, which had been newly opened, a small, delicate boy with golden stripes on his forehead and red lips, along with a silver flame bird, were shocked and amazed. They watched as the heavens and earth's primordial energy, which was somewhat chaotic but incredibly thick, gathered from all directions and poured into a silver light gate in front of them.

This boy was naturally Xiao Bai, and the silver flame bird was naturally Jing Yan.

"This is..." Xiao Bai's eyes widened in shock as he turned to the silver flame bird.

The bird transformed into a small, silver flame person and nodded repeatedly at Xiao Bai.

"This is too amazing... just twenty years and he's about to break through to the Great Luo Realm!" Xiao Bai's face lit up with a radiant smile as he clapped his hands.

The surging primordial energy was too intense, and as it passed through the silver light gate, it sounded like a dragon's roar, causing Xiao Bai and the bird to retreat.

At the same time, the Flower Branch Space was also undergoing a drastic transformation. The violently surging primordial energy was like a stormy attack on the small cave, putting it to the test.

The bamboo forest within the space was shaking violently, and the roots of the spiritual bamboo were glowing as they absorbed the primordial energy, dispersing it throughout the space.

The newly built bamboo tower was radiating a green light, and it seemed to come alive, growing three feet taller.

The spiritual medicine garden in front of the tower was like a paradise, with various spiritual medicines sprouting and blooming. The Two-Lived Tree, which had been growing slowly, was now rapidly growing taller and nearing maturity.

The water pool in front of the tower, which contained the Golden Lotus, was boiling violently, with large bubbles rising to the surface and releasing a misty fog.

Within the fog, dozens of golden lotus flowers bloomed, filling the pool.

The changes in the Flower Branch Space were caused by the dispersal of the primordial energy, but the majority of it was pouring into the bamboo tower.

The entire tower was surrounded by a radiant glow, and with the misty fog as a backdrop, it seemed like a heavenly paradise.

Inside the tower, Han Li sat cross-legged, surrounded by a five-colored glow. His body was like jade, with golden meridians visible beneath his skin. His spiritual sea was filled with a golden light, and his Yuan Ying was sitting in his dantian, surrounded by a temporal aura.

The primordial energy from outside the tower was being absorbed by Han Li, transforming into his power.

For Xiao Bai, Han Li had been in seclusion for only twenty years, but for Han Li, who was within the space, he had actually spent two thousand years cultivating under the Light of the Heavenly Pillar.

After two thousand years of relentless cultivation, the five temporal artifacts had finally reached a state of perfect balance, and Han Li was about to break through to the Great Luo Realm.

Han Li's tightly closed eyes suddenly opened, and two golden lights shot out from his pupils. The primordial energy surrounding him was drawn into his body, and his aura was still unstable.

His clothes were fluttering wildly, and his body was radiating a brilliant light. The air around him was filled with an intense energy, and the sound of his clothes rustling was like a never-ending stream.

Above the tower, a faint, shimmering light appeared in the void, like a river of light.

Han Li slowly stood up, took a deep breath, and felt an immense clarity in his spiritual sea. The flow of spiritual energy around him seemed to be more vibrant than ever before.

Even the tiny, intricate spaces outside the tower seemed to be within his grasp.
