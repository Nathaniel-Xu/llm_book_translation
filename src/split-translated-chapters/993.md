Xue scoffed coldly, his Barbaric Dragon Sword transforming into a gust of black wind that swirled around him, blocking all of the puppet's attacks.

At the same time, his sword energy surged out, entangling the five puppets and Sha Xin, preventing them from leaving.

The other Nightmare Dragon Guards formed a combined attack formation, tightly blocking the people from the Ji Lin Empty Realm, not allowing them to enter the gate.

Upon seeing this, Han Li's thoughts raced, and in the next moment, he flew out, transforming into a black shadow that pounced towards the entrance of the main hall.

The three Nightmare Dragon Guards in front of him immediately noticed Han Li and attacked simultaneously. A golden sword light, a bright snow-white saber glow, and a green spear shadow all struck towards Han Li at the same time.

Han Li didn't slow down at all. Instead, he fiercely stomped on the ground, increasing his speed by three points, taking the initiative to crash into the attack range of the three people in front of him.

However, at the same time, he waved his arm, and a green shadow shot out from his sleeve, agile like a snake, wrapping around the weapons of the three people in an instant, revealing a green long whip.

This item was obtained on the way here from a fallen Nightmare Dragon Guard.

With their weapons entangled by the green long whip, the three people's movements were hindered.

Han Li once again fiercely stomped on the ground, his skin faintly revealing a blood color. His body swayed left and right, once again transforming into several blurry afterimages, his speed increasing by a few points compared to before. In a flash, he bypassed the three people and continued to rush towards the Thousand Machine Hall.

He had already made up his mind not to waste time entangling with anyone. He spared no effort in forcing this body to unleash all its potential in order to enter the Thousand Machine Hall.

But at this moment, a purple-black figure suddenly appeared in front of him.

This person had an extremely tall body, a full two heads taller than the average Nightmare Dragon Guard. On his purple-black armor chest, there was an extra golden dragon head pattern, looking like a leader.

He drew a circle in the air with one of his thick arms, and substantial black light emanated from his hand, enveloping the several human shadows that Han Li had transformed into.

The several human shadows, once covered by the black light, instantly slowed down significantly, as if they were being fixed in place.

"Hmph! A mere trivial body technique, also daring to show off!" The Nightmare Dragon Guard leader sneered coldly, turning his right hand from a claw into a fist and fiercely striking down.

A violent black fist wind erupted from his fist, and the several human shadows dispersed rapidly like bubbles upon contact with the black fist wind.

However, Han Li's figure did not appear, as if he had disappeared.

"This..." The Nightmare Dragon Guard leader was instantly stunned.

"Above!" Xue's voice transmitted over, and the Nightmare Dragon Guard leader quickly looked up upon hearing it.

He saw a blurry human shadow appearing several yards above the Nightmare Dragon Guard leader's head, and it was Han Li.

At this moment, the blood color on his body surface was even heavier, almost dripping with blood, but his speed was faster, bringing with him afterimages, whistling as he flew over the Nightmare Dragon Guard leader's head.

The Nightmare Dragon Guard leader wanted to reach out to intercept, but it was already too late.

"When did Wu Xuan have such strength!" Sha Xin also noticed this scene, a hint of surprise flashing through his eyes, but he immediately waved his hand.

"Useless!" In the sky, Xue's face turned furious as he saw this scene, and he waved his arm.

Nearly a hundred profound orifices on his arm suddenly lit up, faintly revealing strands of blood light.

In the next moment, the Barbaric Dragon Sword in his hand transformed into a black afterimage and shot out from his hand, instantly appearing half a yard behind him, stabbing towards the center of Han Li's back.

Han Li's expression changed slightly, his body moving sideways to dodge, but the speed of the Barbaric Dragon Sword was really too fast, unable to completely avoid it, and his left arm was about to be split open.

His eyes flashed, but he didn't do anything else, allowing the Barbaric Dragon Sword to chop down, his body shooting towards the front.

But at this moment, a golden shadow shot out from the side, instantly blocking behind Han Li, revealing a golden eagle puppet, its two golden sharp claws grabbing towards the Barbaric Dragon Sword.

The Barbaric Dragon Sword easily destroyed the two golden sharp claws, and with a "puchi" sound, it pierced into the chest of the eagle puppet, penetrating it in one shot, but the power of the Barbaric Dragon Sword was also exhausted, stopping there.

Han Li's face revealed a surprised expression, but his body didn't stop at all. Ahead, there were no more obstructions, and his shadow flashed as he rushed into the Thousand Machine Hall.

Xue's face turned furious, and he suddenly looked towards Sha Xin.

Sha Xin's mouth revealed a smile, proudly looking at Xue.

"Send a few people into the hall to kill that thief, absolutely not allowing him to hinder the Holy Emperor!" Xue couldn't be bothered with Sha Xin, shouting angrily.

Xue's authority seemed quite high, and four Nightmare Dragon Guards immediately left the battle formation, chasing towards the hall. The face of that Nightmare Dragon Guard leader turned iron-blue, and he also pounced towards the hall.

Sha Xin's gaze shifted, and with a flutter of his ten fingers, the head of the eagle puppet that was pierced through by the Barbaric Dragon Sword opened its eyes.

Two golden lights shot out from its eyes, flashing and disappearing into the stone wall beside the hall door.

With a "peng" sound, the originally open two hall doors suddenly closed.

The Nightmare Dragon Guard leader and others couldn't stop their momentum, crashing into the door. The tall hall door only flickered with white light, remaining motionless.

"You..." Xue's eyes emitted a cold light, filled with killing intent as he looked towards Sha Xin.

"The Thousand Machine Hall door has already closed, and there is a prohibition set up by the owner himself on the door. With your abilities, forget about opening it. Xue, you miscalculated this time!" Sha Xin suppressed the astonishment in his heart and sneered.
Han Li looked at the palace door that suddenly closed behind him, slightly stunned, but then ignored it and walked into the palace to take a look.

The situation inside the Qianji Palace was exactly the same as what he saw many years later. There were broken table and chair fragments everywhere, and some broken bone armor puppets, obviously having just experienced a fierce fight.

At this moment, there was not a single person in the palace, but it was filled with a blood-colored fog everywhere, emitting a sweet smell.

This blood fog was harmless. On the contrary, Han Li's body had become much slower due to the activation of potential before. As soon as he touched this blood-colored fog, it immediately eased a lot.

He was surprised in his heart, but he didn't pay much attention to these things. His body flashed and he rushed to the back of the palace.

As expected, the black stone chair was still there.

He was overjoyed and grabbed the stone chair, turning it fiercely.

With a "click" sound, a black passage appeared on the ground behind the stone chair, leading to the underground.

Han Li was overjoyed in his heart. The mechanism here had not changed.

He activated the "Wanqiao empty silence technique", and his body shot down. He followed the stone steps inside skillfully and quickly, and soon came to the door hole at the end of the stone steps.

Behind the door hole was the huge underground cave. The rumbling sound came from inside the cave, and each sound was like a thunderbolt exploding, causing the entire underground cave to shake.

Han Li silently came to the side of the door hole and carefully looked outside.

The underground cave was not much different from later. Inside, there was a large blood lake, which was now violently rippling.

However, there was no crystal coffin in the center of the lake, but a blood-red square stone platform suspended in the air.

Around the stone platform stood nine tall blood-red jade pillars, on which countless lines were engraved, emitting dazzling blood light, condensing into a thick blood-red light cover, enveloping the stone platform.

On the stone platform, a figure was sitting cross-legged, who was the Crab Daoist. His whole body was wrapped in dazzling golden light.

At this moment, his eyes were tightly closed, his eyebrows were locked and trembling, as if he was suffering from great pain.

The Crab Daoist's body was also trembling slightly, and strands of phosphorescent gray-white fog flew out from all over his body, floating towards the top of his head.

At this moment, it had already condensed into a large group of Qi, rolling and surging, vaguely forming a human shape.

On the empty ground beside the blood lake, three figures were intertwined, fighting fiercely.

The rumbling sound was caused by the three of them fighting.

The three figures, one black, one white, and one purple, were fighting. The black and white figures were actually the two slashing puppets of the Crab Daoist. The purple figure was a middle-aged man wearing purple armor.

Han Li had also seen this man's appearance, who was the Demon Master Shi Kongyu.

"This is not right. This feeling is not a real person, but also a puppet!" Han Li looked at him twice, and his heart moved. He immediately judged the true body of Shi Kongyu.

It makes sense. The Jilin Space does not allow people above Daluo Realm to enter. Naturally, Shi Kongyu's real body cannot be brought in, so he can only be attached to the puppet.

The three of them moved as fast as lightning, and most of the time they could only see three blurry shadows. With Han Li's reaction speed, he could barely keep up with the movements of the three.

The three figures were sometimes divided and sometimes combined. Every time they fought, they burst out thunderous roars and extremely strong spatial fluctuations.

The underground cave seemed to have a prohibition. The spatial fluctuations hit the cave, causing it to shake a little, but it didn't have much effect.

The blood lake was rolling like raging waves, and the blood-colored fog became more and more dense, filling the entire underground space.

The purple puppet of Shi Kongyu was very powerful. His whole body was wrapped in purple electric arcs. When he moved, he was like a purple electric dragon crossing the void, causing a low and muffled rumbling sound. Wherever he passed, he easily drew curved spatial cracks.

The Crab Daoist's two slashing puppets were also very powerful, and their bodies were wrapped in a layer of golden light, not suppressed by the Jilin Space, so they could use demonic energy and law attacks.

Unfortunately, Shi Kongyu's puppet was too powerful, and the two slashing puppets still couldn't defeat him.

However, Shi Kongyu couldn't do anything about the two slashing puppets, and the two sides fought to a draw.

After a fierce collision, both sides retreated.

" Fellow Daoist Shi Kongyu, don't try anymore. Although your puppet is extraordinary, it is still not as good as us. I think you should retreat. Fellow Daoist Shi no longer cultivates the Space Law and will not pose a threat to you. Why don't you find a way to resolve your past grievances and live in peace? After all, we are all people of the Holy Realm, and the Heavenly Court is our enemy." The white Crab Daoist said.

Shi Kongyu snorted, ignoring what the white Crab Daoist said. His figure flickered and disappeared.

The white Crab Daoist's face changed slightly, and his body quickly moved sideways to dodge. He had just moved 2-3 meters away when a fist flashing with thunder light appeared and hit the position where the white Crab Daoist had been standing.

With a "puchi" sound!

The place where the fist hit seemed to tremble and shatter like the surface of a lake, and a black hole the size of a water tank collapsed.

At this moment, a black shadow flashed over Shi Kongyu's head. It was the other black Crab Daoist appearing out of thin air.

He held a black battle knife in his hand, and with a series of "hissing" sounds, black knife lights burst out, condensing into a black lotus, and enveloping Shi Kongyu.

Where the knife light passed, the void seemed to be cut open like paper!
