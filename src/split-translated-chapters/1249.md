In the void, a figure flashed by, and Miao Fa Xian Zun hastily pursued, but Han Li and the others had already disappeared, leaving only a faint scent of burnt air.

Her expression changed slightly, and a hint of darkness flashed in her eyes. She flashed forward, chasing after them.

More than a hundred miles away, in a dense forest, a octagonal pavilion suddenly lit up with electricity, and a silver lightning array appeared, dropping four figures from the sky. It was Han Li and his companions.

The four of them quickly stabilized their bodies and landed on the edge of the pavilion.

After steadying themselves, Han Li immediately observed their surroundings, seeing that the forest was dense and only a quiet path led to this place. There was no sign of anyone else.

"Jin Tong, can you see where we are?" Han Li asked.

"How can I know? I was just brought here by someone, I didn't tour the entire place. Now, who knows where we were teleported to?" Jin Tong puffed out his cheeks, somewhat annoyed.

"Maybe we've already been teleported out of the Nine Yuan Palace," Xiao Bai said, his imagination running wild.

Xiao Bai, are you daydreaming again? Look at the sky above," Jin Tong said, slapping Xiao Bai on the head and pointing upwards.

Xiao Bai looked up, and in the sky above the forest, he saw that the golden barrier still covered the area, indicating that they were still within the Nine Yuan Palace's boundaries.

"The Nine Yuan Palace's barrier is extraordinary, almost isolating this area from the rest of the world. My lightning array technique can't penetrate the barrier, and even the teleportation distance is greatly reduced," Han Li said, deep in thought.

"See, you should have listened to me earlier and taken care of her. Now, we're in this mess," Jin Tong said, spreading his hands in frustration.

"The Nine Yuan Palace's ancestral hall is within the palace, and from the information we received earlier, it's possible that Chun Jun is stationed there. If we make a commotion here, it will attract his attention, and that would be disastrous," Han Li said, his brow furrowed.

"This...," Jin Tong said, his enthusiasm deflating.

"Enough, let's not argue about this now. We need to find a new direction and continue to think of a way to escape. If the chaos in the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall is quelled, it will be even more difficult for us to escape," Han Li said, sighing.

"Brother Han's words are reasonable, let's hurry and find a way out," Lan Yan said, adding her voice to the conversation.

This time, she had committed a grave offense, and she could no longer stay in the Nine Yuan Palace. She could only escape with Lan Yuanzi and try to find a remote lower realm to hide in.

"But we don't know the way now, where can we find a road?" Jin Tong asked, scratching his head.

"No problem, earlier, I controlled the lightning array to teleport us to the west. We just need to head east again, and we'll be able to return to the place we were before. Then, we can find a way out," Han Li said.

"Master's plans are always thorough," Xiao Bai said, sincerely admiring Han Li.

"I think these days, your flattery skills have become more refined," Jin Tong said, a strange expression on his face.

"Ha ha, it's all thanks to Master's guidance," Xiao Bai said, smiling wryly.

The group continued to make their way through the forest, heading east.

After about half a stick of incense, Han Li suddenly frowned and raised his fist, signaling for Jin Tong and the others to stop.

He then listened carefully, his ears perked up, and after a moment, he turned to the others and said, "There's a battle going on in the distance, and it sounds like a large number of people are involved. It's probably the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall's people being discovered and surrounded. We can't go that way, we need to take a detour."

"Strange, I didn't hear anything," Jin Tong said, puzzled.

Lan Yan and Xiao Bai also said they hadn't heard anything.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he thought for a moment before understanding the reason. It was because of the strange changes in his body after the encounter with the evil corpse.

"Let's avoid that place and head southeast," Han Li said.

Lan Yan nodded first, and Jin Tong and Xiao Bai followed suit.

However, as they turned to head southeast, several figures suddenly appeared in the distance, chasing after each other. The pursuers were wearing the uniform of the Nine Yuan Palace's core elders and disciples, while the ones being chased were from the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall.

Han Li and the others held their breath and carefully observed the scene.

They saw that the two people in the lead, wearing black masks with a serpent and a monkey emblem, were emitting a familiar aura. It was actually Jiao San and Wu Yang.

Behind them, a man with a rabbit mask and a woman with a black hat and a veil were also fleeing. Although they were only visible for a moment, Han Li felt a sense of familiarity.
The person at the back of the group, surprisingly, didn't hide their true self at all, and instead, revealed their true face with a warm smile, occasionally attacking the pursuing soldiers behind them, playing a role of delaying the enemy.

It was none other than the Palace Master of the Great Jin Yuan Immortal Domain, Lu Chuanfeng.

"They've already invaded the Jiyuan Palace..." Lanyan's expression was complex, and her heart was shocked.

Han Li and the others crossed paths with them, but it was just a brief encounter, and soon they disappeared from their line of sight. The only sound that remained was the intermittent thunderous noise coming from the front.

"It seems that the chaos in the Jiyuan Palace won't end anytime soon, but for us, it's a good piece of news. Let's go." Han Li called out, preparing to lead the group to continue on their journey.

At this moment, a strange fluctuation suddenly appeared in the void ahead, and a mixed aura was transmitted over, carried by the strong wind.

Han Li sensed the aura and immediately froze in place.

As the aura reached him, the image of the woman wearing a veil and a fighting hat reappeared in his mind.

Han Li's brow furrowed tightly as he tried to recall the woman's image, and his heart began to beat faster.

"Is it her? Is it really her?"

He suddenly turned around, looking in the direction the group had flown away, and his mind was filled with questions.

"Brother Han, time is of the essence, what's wrong with you?" Lanyan asked, seeing Han Li's unusual expression.

Jintong was also shocked, as she rarely saw such a complex expression on Han Li's face, filled with excitement, doubt, and nostalgia.

"Master..." Xiao Bai also called out.

"I have something to confirm, and I don't plan on leaving immediately." Han Li's face turned serious, and he said.

"Brother Han, why is that?" Lanyan asked, surprised.

"It's a personal matter, and I won't explain it to you. If you don't want to stay, then we'll part ways here." Han Li said directly.

"Brother Han has helped me and my brother greatly, and I wanted to repay him, but now I'm just a burden to him. I won't continue to hinder Brother Han's progress." Lanyan said, after a moment of thought.

"Blue Yuanzi's soul is basically unharmed, and later, you can ask Tiexiong in the Huazhidian for instructions." Han Li said, and with a wave of his hand, a silver light gate appeared in front of Lanyan.

Lanyan bowed to Han Li and walked into the light gate.

"Master, why did we suddenly stop?" Jintong asked, as the silver light gate closed.

"In the group that just passed by, I sensed a familiar aura... Although it's very different from the past, it still triggered the deepest mark in my mind. Even if it's not her, it must be related to her." Han Li said, after a moment of contemplation.

"Her? What kind of person is she, that you're willing to take such a risk?" Xiao Bai asked, unable to help herself.

"She's the person closest to me." Han Li's eyes revealed a hint of a smile.

Jintong's eyes widened in shock, and her mind was filled with surprise. If the previous expression was rare, then the look in Han Li's eyes now was something she had never seen before.

"Since she's so important to you, then we'll follow her and take a look." Jintong said, her eyes flashing with determination.

As they spoke, two figures suddenly flew by above, their attention focused on chasing after the group. Han Li's heart tightened, and he carefully looked in their direction.

It was none other than the Mountain Master of the Bai Zao Mountain, Huo Yuan, and the other was Chi Meng.

However, their attention was focused on chasing after the group, and they didn't notice Han Li and the others hiding in the forest below.

"How did they get here?" Xiao Bai asked, after they flew away.

"It seems they followed the group, but they're not helping the Jiyuan Palace. They must have some secret motives." Han Li said.

As soon as he finished speaking, Han Li's heart moved, and he waved his hand, reopening the silver light gate.

Lanyan walked out of the gate, her expression still a bit uneasy.

"Is everything settled?" Han Li asked.

"Tiexiong has been informed, thank you, Brother Han." Lanyan bowed again.

"That's good. You can continue on your original path, and you should be able to reach the edge of the Jiyuan Palace." Han Li said.

Lanyan handed Han Li a jade slip, saying:

"This is a map of the Jiyuan Palace's area, but it's not very detailed. I hope it can be of some help to you when you leave the palace."

"Thank you. Lanyan, then we'll part ways here. May we meet again on our journey." Han Li said sincerely, as he accepted the jade slip.
