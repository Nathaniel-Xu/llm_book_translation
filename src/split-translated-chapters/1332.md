"Who are you?" 

Han Li stared at the young girl, his eyes lingering on the dragon horn on her head for a moment before moving away, asking in a calm tone, his cold demeanor softened.

As he spoke, he made a hand seal.

The surrounding lightning flashed, and the numerous Qingtong Bee Cloud Swords distributed throughout the Longyuan Xian Domain flew back to him, entering his sleeves in a line.

"My name is Chen Ruyan, and I humbly occupy the position of the Water Origin Dao Ancestor. Han Dao friend, please don't be polite, just call me Ruyan." The blue-haired girl smiled.

Han Li heard this and, despite having some guesses about her identity, couldn't help but narrow his eyes slightly.

He didn't speak, only staring at her.

"Although I captured your Dao companion, it was also under orders. Moreover, I've already returned her to you, so Han Dao friend, please don't be so hostile towards me." Chen Ruyan's small mouth pouted, looking wronged.

"Are you also under the Heavenly Court's command?" Han Li's eyes flashed, asking.

"I haven't truly joined the Heavenly Court, but I occasionally help them with things. It's also out of helplessness... you know, the ancient or modern powers are too strong, and I don't dare offend them." Chen Ruyan smiled, answering with no hint of hostility.

"According to what Feng Qingwu said, wasn't Nan Wan'er already sent to the Heavenly Court? How could she be with you?" Han Li asked in a deep voice.

Chen Ruyan heard this and only smiled, not speaking.

Han Li's eyebrows furrowed.

At this moment, a figure flew out of the blue spirit domain, and it was Feng Qingwu.

The wounds on his body had already disappeared, and his aura had mostly recovered.

"Ruyan, I'm sorry to trouble you." Feng Qingwu bowed to Chen Ruyan, his face filled with shame.

Han Li saw Feng Qingwu and his eyes turned cold.

He wasn't surprised by Feng Qingwu's attitude at the moment.

Chen Ruyan was the Water Origin Dao Ancestor, and Feng Qingwu was the Water Attribute Branch Law Dao Ancestor. The two had a natural subordinate relationship, with Feng Qingwu being Chen Ruyan's subordinate.

This subordinate relationship wasn't rare among the Dao Ancestors, and almost every Origin Dao Ancestor had a group of lower Dao Ancestors following them.

"Han Dao friend is extremely powerful, and I couldn't defeat him. You losing to him is only natural, so don't be so ashamed." Chen Ruyan said calmly, her tone changing from how she spoke to Han Li.

Feng Qingwu looked at Han Li with a complex expression, nodding.

"Han Dao friend, capturing your Dao companion was indeed done by Feng Qingwu's hand, but he was also under the Heavenly Court's orders. Please, considering I've already returned Nan Wan'er to you, don't make things difficult for him in the future. I and Feng Qingwu occasionally help the Heavenly Court with things, but we're not on the same path as Guo or Jin, and we don't intend to be enemies with the Wheel of Rebirth Temple." Chen Ruyan turned around and bowed to Han Li.

Han Li heard this and had a faint realization.

"So, Guo or Jin ordered these two to capture Nan Wan'er, but with the Wheel of Rebirth Temple's large-scale attack on the various Xian domains and the Heavenly Court's full-scale war, they couldn't see through the future situation. They didn't hand Nan Wan'er over to the Heavenly Court, instead leaving her in their hands, waiting to see which way the wind blows before acting. Earlier, Feng Qingwu lied about handing Nan Wan'er over to the Heavenly Court, probably to intentionally provoke me and test my strength. After seeing my strength, they became even more unwilling to offend the Wheel of Rebirth Temple, so they returned Nan Wan'er."

Han Li's mind turned rapidly, instantly analyzing the current situation and the other party's possible motives.

"Since Dao friend Chen said so, I'll spare you this time. Next time, if you dare to take action against someone by my side, you won't be so lucky." Han Li glanced at Feng Qingwu, saying.

He then made a hand seal, and the time domain disappeared. A series of golden lightning flashes appeared on his body.

A loud thunderclap sounded, and his figure vanished.

Chen Ruyan looked at the spot where Han Li had stood, a faint smile on her lips.

"Unexpectedly, the Wheel of Rebirth Temple has pulled in such a powerful expert. Adding to that, the mysterious and unpredictable Wheel of Rebirth Temple Master, who has never truly appeared, the outcome of the war with the Heavenly Court is even harder to predict."

"Ruyan, you returned Nan Wan'er to Han Li. When the Heavenly Court asks about this, how will we respond?" Feng Qingwu's face showed concern.

"No need to worry, just say you were about to send that person to the Heavenly Court when the Wheel of Rebirth Temple's people suddenly appeared and rescued Nan Wan'er. The Heavenly Court is currently at war with the Wheel of Rebirth Temple, and they wouldn't dare to do anything to us." Chen Ruyan shook her head, saying.

"Yes. Ruyan, about Han Li just now..." Feng Qingwu's face relaxed, but he seemed hesitant to speak.

"Just speak your mind." Chen Ruyan said.

"I approximately saw this person two thousand years ago in the Gray Realm, along with a few others. One of them, according to the information I just obtained, is a Demon Realm Prince. I suspect he has some connection to the Demon Realm." Feng Qingwu said.

"Oh, what happened? Please explain in detail." Chen Ruyan's eyebrows moved.

Feng Qingwu didn't dare to be slow, immediately recounting the events that had occurred in the Gray Realm.
From the peak of the Golden Immortal to the current peak of the Da Luo, 2,000 years of time is absolutely impossible to cultivate, he must have hidden his true strength back then... As for the last time he and the Demon Realm Prince broke through the void and went to the Demon Realm, although it's not certain that he was secretly involved, but it's definitely closely related to him. This makes things complicated, could it be that the Reincarnation Hall and the Demon Realm had a connection early on? And that old ancestor Liu Qi's escape from the Gray Realm, could it also be the work of the Reincarnation Hall... Chen Ruyan's eyes narrowed, and the light in them flashed.

"The Demon Realm and the Reincarnation Hall have a relationship, isn't that already a fact? The Reincarnation Hall's mask can build a method for trading across space, it must have an extremely subtle spatial law power to assist it, in the current True Immortal Realm, only the Demon Realm's people can cultivate spatial laws to such a degree." Feng Qing Shui said.

"There's another hidden aspect to this, you don't know about it." Chen Ruyan shook her head slightly, and an unusual color flashed in her eyes.

Feng Qing Shui heard this and was slightly startled, his curiosity was piqued, but seeing Chen Ruyan's expression, he tactfully didn't ask further.

"Back then in the Gray Realm, if that old ancestor Liu Qi was also rescued by the Reincarnation Hall, it's possible that the Barbarian Realm has already formed an alliance with the Reincarnation Hall, this Reincarnation Hall is really formidable, it's omnipresent!" Feng Qing Shui said, changing the subject, his face revealing a hint of shock.

"You think so, if the Reincarnation Hall didn't have this kind of ability, how could it openly and secretly resist the Heavenly Court for so many years, and still stand firm?" Chen Ruyan said calmly.

Feng Qing Shui secretly clicked his tongue, and didn't say anything else.

"The mountain rain is coming, the wind is full of the tower, it seems that the True Immortal Realm is really going to stir up a shocking and earth-shaking calamity, only who knows if we can pass through it safely." Chen Ruyan sighed.

"Like smoke, you're thinking too much, we are the Dao Ancestors, as long as we don't get involved in the Heavenly Court and the Reincarnation Hall's struggle, we should be fine, right?" Feng Qing Shui said, not taking it seriously.

"Fine? If the great calamity comes, anyone can be drawn into it, for example, today, if I hadn't arrived in time, you would have probably already perished." Chen Ruyan said.

Feng Qing Shui's face froze, and he lowered his head.

"Forget it, it's useless to consider these things, let's just take it one step at a time." Chen Ruyan shook her head, and her figure flashed, disappearing instantly.

Feng Qing Shui stood in place for a moment, transforming into a blue light, and flew towards the Fog Dragon Sect.

The fragmented space in the Dragon Abyss Divine Realm had already recovered, and the chaotic heavenly and earthly energies were gradually calming down, the sky slowly clearing up.

At the same time, on a remote small island on the edge of the wilderness, a golden lightning flashed, and Han Li appeared, landing on the island.

He opened his divine sense to explore the surroundings, and didn't find anything unusual, forming a few layers of seals, and covering the entire island.

From the outside, the island seemed to have disappeared without a trace.

After doing this, he flipped his hand and took out two blue pills, swallowing them, and then took out two high-grade immortal stones, grasping them, and absorbing the immortal energy within to recover.

Just now, he had consecutively fought two Dao Ancestors, Han Li's energy was greatly depleted.

Those blue pills were obtained from the water-long Tian's storage magic tool, and belonged to the late Da Luo stage's recovery pills, the effect was quite good, and with the assistance of the two high-grade immortal stones.

Not long after, his energy had recovered by about half.

Han Li didn't continue to cultivate, and stood up, opening the flower branch space entrance, and entering it.

Nangong Wan's body was surrounded by a layer of white light, calmly floating in mid-air, and sleeping peacefully.

Not far away, on the ground, lay a person, it was the Yang Shan Sect Master, previously, after searching his soul, he had casually thrown him into the flower branch space.

Han Li waved his hand, and a golden light flashed, bringing the person before him, and carefully removing the remaining time law traces from his body.

Then, he raised his hand, and a golden lightning flashed, wrapping around the Yang Shan Sect Master, and sending him out of the flower branch space. However, the Yang Shan Sect Master's storage magic tool, Han Li didn't hesitate to take.

The golden lightning flashed, and the Yang Shan Sect Master's figure disappeared, unknown where he was sent.

He had originally planned to use the Yang Shan Sect Master, to exchange for some information about Nangong Wan.

Now that Nangong Wan had been found, the Yang Shan Sect Master was no longer needed, and it wasn't suitable to keep him by his side, he wasn't a bloodthirsty person, so it was better to send him away.

After doing this, Han Li brought Nangong Wan to the attic.

He took out a delicate tooth bed, and placed it there, carefully laying it down.

Han Li sat down beside it, calmly gazing at Nangong Wan's sleeping face, a faint smile appearing on his lips.

Since ascending to the True Immortal Realm, he had unknowingly thought about the person on the bed many times, previously, the two had met, but Nangong Wan hadn't recovered her memories, if what Jiao San said wasn't wrong, today the two could finally meet.

Han Li didn't look for too long, and took a deep breath, calming his emotions, pointing a finger at Nangong Wan's brow.

Nangong Wan's brow immediately floated with a blue pattern, forming a seal, but it wasn't complex.

Han Li's eyes condensed, and his finger's tip lit up, forming a sharp cone shape, lightly piercing the blue seal.

The seal immediately collapsed, flashing twice, and then quickly disappeared.

Nangong Wan's long eyelashes trembled twice, and slowly opened her eyes.
