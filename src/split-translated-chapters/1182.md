Han Li turned the conversation around, asking, "Bottle Spirit Senior, you just said that the Three Corpses can be tamed, is that really true?"

"I wouldn't lie to you, would I? It's just that it's not easy to accomplish," Bottle Spirit replied, seemingly not wanting to discuss the matter further.

Han Li had always been curious about the Three Corpses, but had never had the chance to ask about it before. Now that Bottle Spirit was willing to enlighten him, he asked eagerly, "Bottle Spirit Senior, the three corpses of the Liu family are not equally matched in power, are they? Liu Tianhao has the power of the Great Luo Peak, but Liu Ziyin and Liu Haoran are only at the middle stage of the Great Luo. How do the corpses' powers compare? Can they be strengthened through slow cultivation like a cultivator?"

Bottle Spirit snorted, "I already told you that the Three Corpses are no different from complete living beings. Of course, they can cultivate. As for the Liu family's three corpses having different powers, it's because Liu Qi's physical body has fallen into the hands of the evil corpse. With that as the foundation, the evil corpse's power has made a rapid breakthrough."

Han Li was not deterred by Bottle Spirit's tone, asking, "Is the physical body really that important for the Three Corpses?"

Bottle Spirit replied, "Of course, the physical body is tied to the restrictions of the Heavenly Dao. Without it, the Three Corpses cannot cultivate to the level of the Dao Ancestor. Moreover, the physical body contains the essence of the cultivator's understanding of the laws, which the Three Corpses can absorb and merge with, allowing their power to increase greatly. Otherwise, why do you think the Three Corpses are so eager to obtain the physical body?"

Han Li nodded, enlightened, and asked again, "What is the relationship between the cultivator's physical body and the Three Corpses? Since the Three Corpses are always trying to harm the physical body, why doesn't the physical body just eliminate them?"

Bottle Spirit explained, "The Three Corpses are manifestations of the cultivator's inner demons, and cannot be completely eliminated. Even if the Three Corpses are killed, the demons will still linger, affecting the cultivator's mind and cultivation. It's necessary to re-cultivate and re-seal the demons. Each time the Three Corpses are killed, the demons grow stronger, making it more difficult to cultivate. For the cultivator, the Three Corpses cannot be killed, but also cannot be let go. The best solution is to seal them away."

Han Li thought for a moment, then asked, "If the cultivator's physical body is killed, what happens to the Three Corpses?"

Bottle Spirit replied, "If the physical body is killed, the Three Corpses will lose their source, and become entities that can be killed. That's why the Three Corpses will sometimes protect the physical body's safety."

Just then, White Ze arrived near the group of four, including Liu Qing.

"Your Majesty, you just said that the various clans can choose a successor to inherit the True Spirit King's bloodline. As a member of the Tianhu clan, I should also have the right to inherit the Nine-Tailed Fox Saint Ancestor's bloodline," Liu Tianhao said, bowing slightly.

White Ze replied, "By identity, you do have the right, but what about the matter of Liu Qi's death? How do you explain that?"

Liu Tianhao said, "Your Majesty has already achieved the Dao Ancestor realm, and should know that the Three Corpses naturally try to seize the physical body. I hope Your Majesty will forgive me."

Liu Qing shouted, "Don't listen to him, Your Majesty! Liu Qi's death was definitely due to Liu Tianhao's collusion with outsiders. It's either the Heavenly Court or the Gray Realm, we can't let him off lightly!"

Liu Tianhao ignored Liu Qing's accusations, saying, "I did collaborate with the Gray Realm, but I've since broken ties with them. I've decided to return to the Barbarian Realm, and the blood of the Barbarian Realm flows through my veins. I won't forget that. Now that I've obtained Liu Qi's physical body, I'm only one step away from achieving the Dao Ancestor realm. I'm confident that I can inherit the Nine-Tailed Fox Saint Ancestor's bloodline and achieve the Dao Ancestor realm."

White Ze listened to Liu Tianhao's words, his expression thoughtful, as if he was considering the possibility.

Liu Qing exclaimed, "Your Majesty, Liu Tianhao is cunning and deceitful, his words are not to be trusted! Liu Qi's death was a result of his trusting Liu Tianhao's words. The Saint Ancestor's bloodline is not to be given to him!"

White Ze looked at Liu Qing and Liu Tianhao, then said, "You both have your reasons, and this is an internal matter for the Tianhu clan. As the current Barbarian Realm King, I won't intervene. The Nine-Tailed Fox's bloodline is not a dead object, it has its own spirit. Let it choose its own successor."

Han Li, who was watching from a distance, furrowed his brow slightly.
A drop of gray-white-colored pure blood flew out from the storage ring on his finger, this drop of pure blood was round and shining, containing countless talismans, and flashed into the palm of Lü Yuè'er.

Lü Yuè'er's palm felt a warmth, and her beautiful eyes couldn't help but move.

However, she was also a clever and delicate person, and her expression didn't reveal a single hint of her thoughts.

"Clan leader, rest assured, I will not disappoint you," Lü Yuè'er said with a gentle bow.

On the side, Lü Tiān Hào suddenly looked over in the direction of Lü Qīng and Lü Yuè'er, a hint of doubt flashing in his eyes.

"Go," Lü Qīng said with a smile, nodding his head.

Lü Yuè'er flew up, landing in front of the nine-tailed celestial fox bloodline's virtual shadow.

Lü Tiān Hào saw this and also flew out, landing near Lü Yuè'er.

And Lü Zì, at this moment, also flew up, landing beside the nine-tailed celestial fox bloodline.

"Everyone is ready, let's begin," Bái Zé said calmly.

The three of them heard his voice, and their bodies all released a burst of gray-white light.

Due to their different levels of cultivation, the light surrounding them had obvious differences.

Lü Tiān Hào's cultivation was the highest, and the light he emitted was dazzling, almost impossible to look at directly. Lü Zì's was slightly weaker, and Lü Yuè'er's was the darkest.

The three of them's celestial fox bloodline powers were also fully displayed, and the light they emitted contained a fluctuation, condensing into a celestial fox virtual shadow.

Lü Tiān Hào and Lü Zì's celestial fox virtual shadows were both nine-tailed, but Lü Yuè'er's was six-tailed.

The three celestial fox virtual shadows simultaneously raised their paws and made a move, releasing a force that drew in the nine-tailed celestial fox bloodline.

Although the gray-white light surrounding Lü Yuè'er was relatively dim, the six-tailed celestial fox virtual shadow behind her was exceptionally clear and bright, not inferior to Lü Tiān Hào's and Lü Zì's, and even surpassed Lü Zì's nine-tailed celestial fox virtual shadow in brightness.

Lü Zì saw this scene, and his eyes couldn't help but sink, putting all his effort into stimulating the celestial fox bloodline in his body. The gray-white light surrounding him suddenly became more intense, but the nine-tailed celestial fox virtual shadow didn't change.

And Lü Tiān Hào glanced at Lü Yuè'er, his gaze also sinking.

At this moment, the nine-tailed celestial fox bloodline's virtual shadow's light fluctuated, slowly turning towards the three of them, as if it were a living creature looking at them.

The bloodline's virtual shadow's gaze swept across Lü Zì's body, immediately moving away, landing on Lü Yuè'er and Lü Tiān Hào's bodies.

Seeing this scene, Lü Zì's entire body stiffened, and his face turned pale.

The nine-tailed celestial fox bloodline's virtual shadow's gaze wandered between Lü Yuè'er and Lü Tiān Hào, seemingly unable to decide which one to choose.

At this moment, Lü Tiān Hào waved his hands, making a series of strange movements, and let out a long, mysterious, and heavenly howl.

The celestial fox virtual shadow behind him immediately brightened, becoming clearer.

The nine-tailed celestial fox bloodline's virtual shadow immediately looked over, its surrounding light flashing, as if it were about to fly over.

But just at this moment, a strange, shrill cry sounded, coming from Lü Yuè'er's body.

Lü Yuè'er's brow suddenly flashed, and a water droplet-shaped gray-white mark appeared, radiating bright light.

The gray-white patterns on her body suddenly brightened, emitting a fiery, gray-white light, and seemed to be moving like a living creature.

The celestial fox virtual shadow behind Lü Yuè'er suddenly brightened, its light increasing by several times, immediately suppressing Lü Tiān Hào's nine-tailed celestial fox virtual shadow.

The nine-tailed celestial fox bloodline's virtual shadow's eyes flashed with a hint of surprise, immediately abandoning Lü Tiān Hào and looking at Lü Yuè'er, opening its mouth to spit out a beam of gray-white light.

A thick, gray-white light beam shot out from its mouth, containing powerful bloodline energy fluctuations, which continuously merged into Lü Yuè'er's body.

And the nine-tailed celestial fox bloodline's virtual shadow flashed rapidly, quickly becoming thinner.
