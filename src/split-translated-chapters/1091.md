It's now come to this, so I'll no longer hide it from you all. As for the seventh floor of the Years Tower, I, Lei Yu, actually know a thing or two. You've all come this far, so you must have already realized that this Years Tower is a prison, holding many prisoners. The seventh floor is no exception, suppressing an extraordinary demon.

"An extraordinary demon?" Han Li raised an eyebrow.

"That's right, this extraordinary demon is far beyond the prisoners we've encountered before." Lei Yu added.

"We've encountered prisoners who have already reached the Great Luo realm, so is this extraordinary demon a Dao Ancestor or not?" Lan Yan sneered, speaking with disdain.

"My sect's founder participated in the sealing of this demon, and according to the records left behind by the founder, this demon is not a Dao Ancestor, but is not far off." Lei Yu's expression turned serious.

Lan Yan saw Lei Yu's expression and withdrew the smile from his face.

"Your sect's founder came to this place before? This Years Tower should have been built by the Tai Sui Immortal, so did your sect's founder know the Tai Sui Immortal?" Han Li's eyes narrowed, asking.

"There's no mention of it in our sect's records, and I don't know." Lei Yu looked at Han Li and shook his head.

Han Li remained silent, but in his heart, he was skeptical of Lei Yu's words, unsure if he was intentionally not saying anything or truly didn't know.

"Lei, the demon you mentioned, is it the same one that performed the blood sacrifice on the entire Jin Yuan Immortal Domain?" Su Qi suddenly interrupted, asking.

"That's right, it's the same one. Su, you must have a deep impression of this demon, right?" Lei Yu looked at Su Qi deeply and said.

"Of course, our Tian Shui Sect's records also mention the great calamity that occurred back then." Su Qi's face turned pale as she nodded.

"What are you two talking about? Can you tell us?" Han Li asked.

"You all aren't from the Jin Yuan Immortal Domain, so you wouldn't know about this. In the distant past, during the great war between the immortal and demonic realms, our Jin Yuan Immortal Domain experienced a great calamity. A demon named the Black Sky Demon God descended upon our domain, unleashing a powerful demon array that sacrificed the entire domain. At that time, more than half of the living beings in our domain died in that array. Later, the Heavenly Dao Ancestor intervened, breaking the array. This event was a great calamity for our domain, causing immense damage that still hasn't been fully recovered from. The Black Sky Demon God's name is also a taboo in our domain." Su Qi sighed and said.

"I see." Han Li nodded slowly, his eyes gazing towards the front of the cave, his mind racing.

It turned out that the demon in this place was related to the great war between the immortal and demonic realms back then. What connection did it have to the Night Sun Kingdom?

"What Su said is true. In fact, the reason the Tai Sui Immortal's estate appeared this time is not a coincidence. According to our sect's records, it's likely that the demon is breaking through the seal, causing the estate to appear. My and Wen Zhong's purpose in coming here is to reinforce the seal. The sealing array has five array eyes, arranged according to the five elements of gold, wood, water, fire, and earth. Each array eye also seals a demon from the demonic realm. The golden altar over there is one of the gold array eyes." Lei Yu continued.

"The golden altar has already collapsed, so one of the array eyes has been destroyed?" Lan Yan's voice was laced with unease.

The others also turned serious.

"That's right. Originally, as long as the five array eyes were intact, the Black Sky Demon God wouldn't be able to escape. But now that the gold array eye has been destroyed, if the other array eyes are also destroyed, the Black Sky Demon God will likely break free from the seal. At that time, not only will we be in grave danger, but the entire Jin Yuan Immortal Domain will also fall into a great calamity. So, everyone must be careful from now on and avoid destroying the other array eyes." Lei Yu's expression turned extremely serious.

The others nodded in agreement.

"What do we do next? Should we continue forward?" Lan Yan asked.

"That's right. Before we go, I'll try to repair the array here. This array is the key to the gold array eye, and although it's damaged, the original energy hasn't completely dissipated. If we can repair it, it might still have some effect." Lei Yu thought for a moment before saying.

He then began to examine the array on the ground.

Wen Zhong also came forward to help, and the two of them discussed it briefly before starting to repair the array.

Han Li and the others weren't familiar with the array on the ground, so they couldn't help. They walked to the side and continued to meditate and cultivate.

After a while, Han Li and the others were still meditating when a strong array fluctuation suddenly appeared, causing them to quickly stand up.

They saw that the golden array on the ground had been repaired, and it was now humming with energy. A thick golden light rose from the array and merged into the stone wall above.

Lei Yu's hands moved rapidly, and the golden array slowly stopped, the golden light column disappearing.

"It's good that the array wasn't damaged too badly, so we were able to repair it." Lei Yu's face showed a hint of a smile as he nodded.

"Will the repaired array have any effect?" Lan Yan asked, seemingly afraid of the Black Sky Demon God.

"I don't know, but I hope it will." Lei Yu was silent for a moment before saying.

The others exchanged glances, and no one spoke for a while.

"Let's go, we've delayed for too long. Let's hurry and move forward." Lei Yu said, then waved his hand, releasing a burst of golden light that gathered nearby rocks and covered the golden array.

(To be continued)
Everyone's injuries had mostly recovered, and they were no longer willing to stay in the same place, so they continued onward.

Along the mountain cave, they walked for a long time before finally exiting the cave.

Outside the cave, there was a platform with an area of no more than a few hundred meters, with rugged rocks and boulders scattered about, as if it were located on the middle slope of a massive mountain peak.

Han Li and the others arrived at the edge of the platform and looked around, but saw nothing but a vast expanse of gray mist swirling in the air.

Xiong Shan gazed out at the distance for a moment, his brow furrowed, and then raised his golden long sword, slashing downwards towards the distant void.

A loud sword hum resounded, and a massive golden sword light burst forth, shooting out for a moment.

Looking at the sword's strength and speed, it should have instantly cleaved through the void, traveling hundreds of miles in an instant. However, to everyone's surprise, the sword light flew out for only a few hundred meters before suddenly crashing into an invisible wall, exploding and dispersing.

"Indeed, there is a restriction..." Xiong Shan muttered to himself.

"Everyone, don't bother trying, this mountain peak's restriction is connected to the root of the entire Years Tower. Unless someone has the ability to destroy the entire Years Tower, it's impossible to forcefully break through." Lei Yu Ce cautioned.

Han Li heard this and immediately expanded his divine sense, beginning to probe the surroundings.

However, his brow soon furrowed, as the restrictions on his divine sense were extremely severe, and even his powerful divine sense couldn't extend too far.

Seeing this, the group had no other choice but to fly up the mountain slope, following the edge of the cliff.

After flying for nearly a thousand meters, Jiao San suddenly let out a soft "ah" and stopped.

Everyone saw this and also stopped, following her gaze upwards to see another cliff platform, with a man-made stone staircase winding its way up the mountain.

"Let's go take a look." Lei Yu Ce called out, leading the way.

Wen Zhong and Su Qi followed closely behind, with Han Li and the others flying up shortly after.

Han Li landed on the cliff edge, his eyes scanning the surroundings, and found that there were no caves, only the stone staircase.

The group then ascended the staircase, one by one, continuing upwards towards the mountain peak.

The stone steps were steep and winding, leading them upwards for several hundred meters before arriving at another, larger platform.

There, a massive blue-roofed grand hall stood, built into the mountain slope, with eaves that seemed to fly upwards, giving off a sense of ancient elegance.

In front of the grand hall, there was a large square with an area of several hundred meters, its surface reflecting a mirror-like glow, as if it were a lake. Water vapor seemed to rise from it, shrouding the area in a faint blue mist.

Lan Yuanzi's eyes scanned the mist, his brow furrowed, and a hint of doubt flashed in his eyes.

"Brother, what's wrong?" Lan Yan asked.

"This place seems to be shrouded in water and mist, with a faint wave of Water Attribute laws fluctuating within. However, the water vapor doesn't seem as dense as it appears, I think... this is likely a Water Attribute illusion array." Lan Yuanzi pondered.

"Water Attribute illusion array?" Han Li's brow furrowed as well.

His eyes flashed with purple light, and his Nine Underworlds Devil Eyes divine sense began to rotate, carefully examining the area.

Under the Devil Eyes' gaze, the water mist revealed a series of water vapor whirlpools, swirling and flowing within, each one attracting and repelling the others, forming a unique energy fluctuation.

However, after gazing at it for a moment, Han Li felt a slight wetness in his eyes, as if the water vapor was seeping into his eyes. He was about to wonder what was happening when he looked around and discovered that Lei Yu Ce, Jiao San, and the others had all vanished.

He let out a wry smile, feeling a sense of helplessness, realizing that they had all entered the illusion array when they crossed the last step of the staircase.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he began to fully activate his Refine Spirit Technique, attempting to use his powerful divine sense to force his way through the illusion.

However, as soon as he activated the technique, the surroundings changed.

The water vapor whirlpools seemed to be stimulated, and each one began to rotate wildly, colliding and crashing into each other, as if they were hurricanes colliding.

Han Li's heart had just formed this thought when he suddenly found himself standing on a dark, stormy sea, surrounded by the sound of crashing waves.
