Ye Susu was no longer flustered, calmly meeting Dongfang Bai's gaze as he looked at her.

In her mind, she recalled the words Han Li had said to her when they parted ways, and she couldn't help but feel a deep sense of admiration. It seemed that everything that was happening today was within his expectations, and she only needed to follow his plan.

Just then, a burst of air-piercing sound echoed through the air, and a streak of light shot down from the sky, plummeting towards the courtyard.

The light dissipated, revealing a tall, thin old man with gray hair and a long nose.

"Lu Changlao, how was it?" Dongfang Bai asked calmly, his eyes fixed on the old man.

"I reported to the Palace Master, in a mountain peak several thousand miles north of here, I found some residual aura. It seemed that Han Li had stopped there for a while and switched to a flying vehicle, a type of spiritual artifact. After that, I tracked him to a place near the Jin Yuan mountain range, where I found some faint residual aura, but it was very weak. I suspect he used some method to conceal his tracks. I marked the location and didn't pursue further," the old man said, bowing deeply.

"You did well," Dongfang Bai nodded, his expression unchanging.

"So, it seems they didn't lie... This person is indeed cunning!" Tao Ji muttered to himself, his eyes narrowing.

"Let's go," Dongfang Bai said, turning to look at Ye Susu once more before disappearing into thin air.

Tao Ji and the others quickly followed suit, vanishing from sight.

The courtyard was left empty, with only the members of the Qing Huo tribe staring at each other in silence.

Ye Susu's palms were sweating, and she glanced at her mother before looking up at the warships hovering above the city, her mind filled with doubts. What kind of person was this Han Li, to warrant such a massive response from the Heavenly Palace?

On the deck of one of the warships, Tao Ji and the others reappeared, seeing Dongfang Bai standing at the ship's rail, gazing down at the city below.

As they approached, he suddenly spoke up, his voice cold and detached.

"Destroy the entire tribe."

"What? They..." Tao Ji's expression changed, and he hastily spoke up, but then stopped himself.

The Qing Huo tribe's involvement with Han Li was of no concern to Dongfang Bai; what mattered was Han Li's whereabouts, and he couldn't let anyone else find out. Otherwise, it would attract unwanted attention, and he wouldn't be able to claim the credit for retrieving the Heavenly Bottle.

"Understood!" Hei Dao replied, his voice firm.

"Make sure to leave no traces behind. If the Heavenly Prison finds out, it will be a hassle," Dongfang Bai added.

"Yes," Hei Dao replied, turning to leave.

"Tao Changlao, Lu Changlao, bring the army and speed up the pursuit. We can't let Han Li get away," Dongfang Bai ordered.

"Yes," Lu Yun replied, his voice respectful.

Tao Ji hesitated for a moment before speaking up, "Yes."

He had a deep understanding of Han Li's terrifying strength, and if possible, he would have liked to bring more people to aid in the pursuit. However, with Dongfang Bai leading the charge, he knew he wouldn't be able to intervene. At the very least, he could witness the battle firsthand.

Dongfang Bai raised his hand, and a wave of white light surged forth, revealing a ten-meter-long white flying vessel adorned with intricate symbols and glowing with a soft, ethereal light. It was undoubtedly a high-grade spiritual artifact.

He stepped onto the vessel, and Tao Ji and the others followed closely behind.

As Lu Yun pointed out the direction, the vessel burst into a brilliant white light, shooting off into the distance and disappearing from view.

Meanwhile, the golden warships hovering above the city began to stir, their symbols glowing with an intense, golden light. The ships slowly descended, their attack arrays opening up, unleashing a devastating aura that engulfed the city.

The city was soon engulfed in flames, and the destruction was said to have been caused by a heavenly calamity.

Time passed, and half a year went by.
In the northern part of the Jinyuan Immortal Realm, there was a river system called the Longjiang River, which converged with the Yujiang River and the Shuiyang River to form a vast lake called the Sanjiang Lake, spanning thousands of miles, beneath the Shubi Mountain.

Legend had it that the Sanjiang Lake was originally a place with hundreds of peaks and hills, all connected to the Shubi Mountain, which was a branch of the Jinyuan Mountain Range stretching northwards. A large immortal sect had once been built here.

However, in an unknown era, a great war broke out, and the immortal sect was completely destroyed. The majority of the peaks and hills were also destroyed in the battle, and the land sank into the ground.

After countless years of transformation, the Longjiang River and the other two rivers changed their courses, converging at this place, and burying the remaining peaks and hills under the water.

Although the immortal sect had perished, the Shubi Mountain still had many remnants of its ancient buildings, most of which were occupied by the "Shuli Sect", which was built less than a hundred thousand years ago. After renovation and reconstruction, it had a fresh new atmosphere.

However, after being washed away by the tides of time, the Shuli Sect only obtained some remnants of the ancient buildings, and the remaining treasures of the immortal sect were also mere remnants.

Rumor had it that beneath the Sanjiang Lake, there were still some remnants of the ancient immortal sect, some of which still had arrays protecting them, and inside, there might be some undiscovered treasures.

After the Shuli Sect was built, it naturally included the Sanjiang Lake within its sphere of influence. However, due to its lack of strength, it did not dare to seal it off for exclusive use, but instead, after development, it renovated some of the remaining immortal sects and built them into dragon palaces and water residences, which were rented out to cultivators.

High-level cultivators naturally looked down on the residual spiritual energy in the water residences, but many true immortal cultivators, especially those who cultivated water attribute techniques or water attribute laws, liked to reside here.

Relying on the rent, the Shuli Sect lived a comfortable life.

One day, a young cultivator with a tall stature and ordinary appearance came to the Shuli Sect's welcoming hall, seeking to rent a water residence for cultivation.

This young cultivator was none other than Han Li.

The attendant elder was a slightly plump, round-faced old man with kind eyebrows and eyes. Seeing the young cultivator's ordinary appearance and attire, he secretly looked down on him.

"Guest, you want to rent a water residence? That's just in time, as there are only three remaining water residences in the Sanjiang Lake. I'll bring the map for you to choose."

Han Li stretched out his hand to stop the elder, smiling and saying, "No hurry, I heard there are over a dozen unopened water residences in the Sanjiang Lake. I'd like to choose one from those."

In fact, the Sanjiang Lake did have many water residences, but after thousands of years of development, most of them had been opened up, and only a few were still sealed off by powerful immortals, which the Shuli Sect could not open.

However, the Shuli Sect did not spend a lot of money to hire experts to break the seals, but instead announced that anyone who paid the same price as the other water residences could obtain the qualification to enter the unopened water residences.

Whether or not they could actually enter, depended on the cultivator's abilities.

As for the treasures obtained from the water residences, as long as they did not affect the continued existence of the water residences, they would belong to the cultivator who rented them.

In the beginning, many cultivators came to rent the unopened water residences, but most of them failed, and those who did enter were often killed inside. Only a few lucky ones managed to open the water residences and return with treasures.

However, as time passed, most cultivators realized the truth and lost interest in coming to the Sanjiang Lake to take risks. The attendant elder had not seen someone like Han Li, who came to rent an unopened water residence, in a long time.

"Ah, good, good! Guest, please sit down and wait for a moment. Even if you want to rent an unopened water residence, you'll need to look at the map and choose one. I'll go get it."

The round-faced old man led Han Li to a side hall and sat him down, then turned to leave.

As he turned, he asked, "By the way, may I ask your name, guest?"

"Han Li," Han Li replied casually without looking up.

"Ah, Han Li, nice to meet you," the old man said with a nod, before turning to leave.

A moment later, the old man returned with a map of the Sanjiang Lake's underwater layout, and gave Han Li a rough explanation of the distribution of the water residences and their current rental status.

Han Li listened to the old man's explanation while his eyes scanned the map, searching for the perfect water residence.
