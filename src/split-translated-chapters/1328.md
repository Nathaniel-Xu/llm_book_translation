Inside the Fog Dragon Sect, a grand hall stood quietly, its exterior shrouded in an aura of mystery. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the void, and it was Han Li.

Outside the grand hall, two guards clad in blue armor stood watch, their auras powerful and at the late stage of the Taiyi Realm. They were about to shout out a warning when Han Li swept his gaze over them, a hint of light flashing in his eyes.

The two guards instantly stiffened, as if they had turned into statues.

Han Li ignored them and looked towards the tightly closed palace gates. The gates were sealed with a layer of hazy blue light, indicating the presence of a powerful restriction.

Han Li examined the palace gates, then turned to face the distance and waved his sleeve.

Seventy-two thin golden lightning bolts shot out from his sleeve, disappearing into the void. In the vast expanse of the Tianhai Continent, the lightning bolts reappeared, forming a massive circle that enveloped the entire continent.

Golden lightning arcs burst forth from the lightning bolts, intertwining and forming a birdcage-like pattern. The entire continent was shrouded in a golden lightning net.

However, the net only appeared for an instant before dissolving into the void. The sky above the continent darkened, with thick black clouds gathering, resembling the approach of a storm.

The cultivators on the continent noticed the changes in the sky but didn't pay much attention, as the Dragon Abyss was known for its turbulent weather.

Han Li's figure flashed, and he transformed into a golden light that shot towards the palace gates.

The restriction on the gates was triggered, and waves of blue light surged out, attempting to block the golden light.

However, the golden light pierced through the blue light, entering the palace gates without hesitation.

Inside the palace, an old man with a gaunt face and frail body sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion. A blue glow surrounded his head, condensing into a massive blue flower that rotated and emitted a clear, resonant sound.

Blue petals floated from the flower, dancing and fluttering around the palace, releasing a peculiar, enchanting fragrance.

The old man suddenly opened his eyes and looked towards the entrance, about to rise from his seat.

Han Li appeared in the palace, his figure flashing with golden light.

The old man reacted swiftly, his body bursting with energy as he leapt into the air. His aura surged, reaching the peak of the Daluo Realm.

A loud, thunderous roar erupted from his body, and a massive blue dragon shadow appeared around him.

As the dragon shadow emerged, the old man's withered body seemed to regain its vitality, his muscles swelling, his hair turning black, and his skin becoming radiant and smooth. His aura transformed, becoming wild and untamed, like a raging dragon.

The old man's sleeves fluttered as he unleashed a powerful punch towards Han Li.

A massive fist of energy shot towards Han Li, accompanied by the blue dragon shadow.

The palace's void cracked, and countless fissures appeared, but it didn't shatter. The old man's punch was met with a massive, unseen force that countered it.

The Fog Dragon Sect's restrictions were triggered, and the entire sect was enveloped in a brilliant blue light. The continent's energy surged, gathering towards the palace.

The palace walls burst with intense blue light, emitting a mystical music that seemed to come from the depths of the ancient earth.

A massive wave of blue light erupted from the walls, crashing towards Han Li with incredible force.

The palace's atmosphere became heavy, as if it had been transported to the bottom of the ocean, rendering movement impossible.

Everything happened in an instant.

Han Li sensed the situation outside and furrowed his brow, then relaxed and raised his hand, striking the void.

A massive golden fist condensed, punching out with incredible force.

Without any extraordinary phenomena, the fist's energy shattered the incoming blue light, the dragon shadow, and the old man's attack.

The old man's face turned pale, and he attempted to flee.

However, the golden fist was faster, appearing above the old man's head and transforming into a palm that struck downwards.

The old man let out a deafening roar, and his body glowed with blue light as he raised his hands to defend himself.

The palace shook violently, and the old man's body was crushed into the ground, his vitality severely depleted.

A finger appeared in front of the old man, lightly touching his forehead.

Several crystal chains shot out from the finger, piercing the old man's brow.
The old man's body stiffened, his eyes becoming empty and lifeless.

Han Li appeared in front of the old man, lifted him up from the ground, and then vanished into thin air.

The blue water waves inside the hall slowly dissipated, and the shattered void slowly healed.

At this moment, three strong lights fell outside the hall, revealing three figures.

A tall, middle-aged man, a blue-robed woman, and a three-foot-tall child with a youthful appearance.

The three of them exuded powerful auras, all of whom were great Luo existences. The middle-aged man and the blue-robed woman were in the middle stage of the great Luo realm, while the child had reached the late stage of the great Luo realm.

The two blue-armored guards outside the hall were unconscious, unaware of their surroundings.

Seeing this scene, the three of them turned serious.

"Palace Master, what has happened?" the middle-aged man asked, looking at the hall.

There was no response from inside the hall.

"It's likely that something has happened inside, let's go take a look." The blue-robed woman said in a low voice.

The other two had no objections, and they jointly broke through the hall's seal.

The seal on the hall was opened, and the three of them entered.

Inside the hall, the floor was in disarray, and the Palace Master's figure had disappeared without a trace. There was a pool of blood on the ground.

The middle-aged man dipped his finger in the blood and investigated with his divine sense, judging that the blood belonged to the Palace Master.

"This is bad. It seems that the Palace Master has been seriously injured and taken away." The middle-aged man said in a cold voice.

Although the others had anticipated this, they still looked grim upon hearing the news.

"Palace Master's strength has reached the peak of the great Luo realm. Who could have done this? Could it be...?" The blue-robed woman said, her face pale.

"Not necessarily. If it was a great Luo existence, it's unlikely that they could have done this, but if it was the Dao Ancestor..." The child suddenly spoke up, his voice clear and crisp, but with an exceptionally old tone.

"It shouldn't be, the Dao Ancestor's status is too revered, and it's unlikely that they would lower themselves to deal with us great Luo cultivators." The middle-aged man forced a smile and said, his voice involuntarily lowering, as if afraid of being overheard.

"The current situation in the True Immortal Realm is chaotic, and many things should not be thought of in the same way as before. Otherwise, we will suffer greatly." The child continued.

"Ji Elder, what do you think we should do now?" The middle-aged man asked, looking at the child.

The blue-robed woman also looked over.

"The Palace Master's disappearance is likely related to the Dao Ancestor, and it's not something we can handle. We should notify the Old Ancestor." The child said.

The middle-aged man and the blue-robed woman exchanged a glance, nodding in agreement.

...

In the chaotic void, a golden light the size of a few acres floated in the air, resembling a giant egg. It was impossible to see inside.

Inside the golden light, there was a completely solidified space, with an area of several tens of miles, complete with mountains, rivers, and trees.

The Palace Master of the Yunlong Sect was placed on the ground, and Han Li's hand was pressed against his forehead, his palm glowing with a faint light as he cast a soul-searching spell.

The light flashed, growing brighter, and emitting a series of eerie screams.

Han Li's brow furrowed, however, as the Palace Master's soul was somewhat unusual, seemingly having cultivated a secret technique that condensed all his memories into a single point, forming a strange seal.

Moreover, this seal was tightly connected to the Palace Master's soul, and was extremely unstable. If Han Li were to forcefully investigate, the Palace Master's soul would immediately self-destruct.

Han Li's face revealed a thoughtful expression, and he quickly withdrew his hand, sealing the Palace Master's cultivation and tapping his forehead.

Several crystal chains flew out of the Palace Master's forehead, entering Han Li's body.

The Palace Master slowly woke up, looking around, and finally fixing his gaze on Han Li.

"Which Dao Ancestor are you, sir? Why have you lowered yourself to take me away?" the Palace Master asked.

"Yangshan Palace Master, there's no need to be so cautious. I've brought you here not to take your life, but to ask you a few questions. Once I've finished, you can leave." Han Li said, smiling lightly.

Yangshan Palace Master heard this, his face revealing a look of surprise, and after a moment of consideration, he closed his eyes.

"Does this mean you refuse to cooperate with me?" Han Li asked, his brow twitching.

"Not at all. I may not know who you are, but you can't expect me to reveal any information about the Old Ancestor. You can kill me or torture me, but I won't say anything." Yangshan Palace Master said coldly.

"Very well, I admire your loyalty. However, the information I seek is also very important, and I must ask you. Unfortunately, I'll have to make you suffer a bit." Han Li said calmly, not showing any anger at Yangshan Palace Master's refusal.

"You can try to forcefully search my soul, but my soul has the Nine Dragon Seal set by the Old Ancestor. Even if you're a Dao Ancestor, you can only make my soul scatter, and you won't be able to investigate my memories." Yangshan Palace Master sneered.

"Ah, the seal was set by Feng Qingyu himself. It's indeed very clever, and can prevent most Dao Ancestors from searching my soul. Unfortunately, you've encountered me." Han Li said, smiling lightly.
