Deep within the altar, a massive underground space unfolded, with surging red light and crimson magma flowing everywhere. The magma converged into a dark red lake, emitting scorching hot smoke, and at its center, a massive black rock floated, surrounded by eight black rock pillars. Each pillar was covered in dense cracks, with the magma flowing through them, casting a flickering glow. On top of the pillars, golden chains were embedded, converging towards the center of the rock.

A gaunt, skeletal man knelt on the ground, his hair disheveled, his body emaciated to the point of near-skeletal. His chest, abdomen, shoulders, and arms were pierced by the golden chains, binding him to the center of the rock. Beneath him, ancient symbols etched into the ground emitted a powerful sealing force.

Han Li's gaze sank, and he felt a strange sensation, as if he was staring into a bottomless abyss of desire. He shook his head, dispelling the thought, but his eyes flashed with a sudden realization. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but something about this formation seemed off.

Just then, the gaunt man lifted his head, locking eyes with Han Li. His pale face twisted into a grotesque smile, revealing a row of snow-white teeth. Han Li's heart skipped a beat, and he hastily activated his cultivation technique, but found nothing amiss.

As the crowd watched in awe, a dark mist escaped from the edge of the black hole, flowing towards the group before disappearing. No one noticed this subtle event.

With the crisis averted, Dao Yin's attention returned to the altar.

"I'll settle this once and for all!"

He sighed, his eyes flashing with determination, and raised his hand to grasp the yellow seal. A droplet of blood fell onto the seal's surface, and it absorbed the liquid. Dao Yin began to chant, and the seal's inscription flashed with a yellow light, releasing a powerful earth attribute law.

Dao Yin used the blood refinement technique to forcibly break the seal's restriction and began to activate the Five Elements Devouring Void Formation.

The five treasures floating in the air radiated an unprecedented brilliance, and the five assistants, including Lei Yu Ce, felt their laws surging out like a tidal wave, absorbed by the formation. The five-colored light screen surrounding the altar began to shrink, covering only a few meters around the altar.

As the light screen enveloped the altar, the already damaged structure began to crumble, like an ancient, worn-out painting, disintegrating into dust. The black mist escaping from the altar's mouth was also absorbed, vanishing into nothingness.

"This is the true power of the Five Elements Devouring Void Formation... everything within its range returns to dust..." Qi Mozi murmured.

The five-colored light sphere slowly descended into the altar, enveloping the black rock, the stone pillars, and the gaunt man. The rock began to disintegrate, but the gaunt man's body remained intact, his gray hair disheveled, his face twisted in contempt.

Han Li's eyes locked onto the gaunt man, who suddenly turned his head and made a grotesque face at Han Li. Dao Yin's expression turned solemn, and he activated his cultivation technique, unleashing a torrent of energy.

The divine lamp's symbol flashed with a golden light, and the paper ignited, leaving behind a condensed gold flame. The flame flew into the lamp's lantern, merging with the flame inside.

The lamp's flame trembled, and a massive wave of energy erupted from its surface. A golden lightning bolt, surrounded by flames, flashed from the lamp's core, striking the five-colored sphere.

A deafening explosion shook the air!

The five-colored sphere's interior was filled with a blinding golden light, merging with the five-colored glow, and obscuring the space within.
Inside the altar's great cave, multicolored light burst forth, and the sound of thunderous rumbling continued unabated. The sealed stone pillars, golden chains, and the withered man were all submerged in the light, disappearing from view.

After a long time, the five-colored sphere's momentum subsided, and the light dissipated. The void within was completely extinguished, and everything was reduced to nothingness.

 Accompanied by a faint "plop" sound, the five-colored sphere burst open like a dream bubble, producing a circular rainbow in the void before vanishing.

"Dust returns to dust, earth returns to earth. After being sealed for so long, I can finally exterminate you completely."

Dao Yin Zhenren gazed at the scene, his taut expression finally relaxing as he exhaled a long breath. His entire body swayed slightly.

Lei Yu Ce and the others were like people who had been granted a great amnesty, each panting heavily as they sat down. After forcing down a medicinal pill, they continued to manipulate the seal, controlling the surroundings.

Their bodies' law energy had been almost entirely absorbed, and their spiritual energy had been greatly depleted. They could be said to have suffered a severe internal injury, but fortunately, the outcome was not bad, and they had finally exterminated the old demon.

"Earlier, you all rushed to break the seal and fight for the treasure, which was quite exhilarating. Now it's time to pay the price..." Dao Yin Zhenren's gaze shifted, looking at Han Li and the others as he spoke slowly.

Everyone's expressions changed slightly upon hearing his words.

Dao Yin Zhenren was a great Luo cultivator, and with the Years God Lamp in his possession, he could use the five-colored sphere's divine ability once more. Most of these people would not be able to resist him.

Qi Mo's eyes sank, and his gaze moved back and forth between Dao Yin Zhenren and Han Li, seemingly calculating how to avoid conflict with the former while also eliminating the latter, who posed a boundless threat.

Jiao San's brows were furrowed, and he stood with Huo San, both of them looking worried.

Just as everyone was lost in thought, a sudden change occurred!

Dao Yin Zhenren took a step forward, about to approach Lei Yu Ce and the others, when a white light flashed from his abdomen, and a nearly transparent, narrow blade suddenly protruded from his stomach, spewing forth a burst of blood.

Dao Yin Zhenren's eyes widened in anger, and he struck back with a palm, targeting the person behind him.

However, the person had already retreated rapidly, avoiding the palm and reappearing in the distance.

Everyone was shocked by this sudden turn of events, their faces filled with confusion as they looked at the person.

Lei Yu Ce cried out in disbelief, "Wen Zhong, what are you doing?"

Wen Zhong, standing behind Dao Yin Zhenren, heard the rebuke and his expression twisted, his eyes filling with resentment.

His attack had been too sudden, catching everyone off guard, and he had not even released a hint of killing intent or spiritual energy fluctuations.

Dao Yin Zhenren had just exhausted a large amount of true essence to kill the demon with the five elements' void array. His heart was still tense, and he had relaxed his guard, making him vulnerable to Wen Zhong's attack.

"Ha ha... what am I doing? You ask what I'm doing? I want to kill this biased and ruthless old Daoist!"

Wen Zhong's expression was manic, and he laughed uncontrollably.

"Why? Have you gone mad? He's our sect's master, and your teacher, too..." Lei Yu Ce was still trying to understand, his anger rising.

"Since he's our teacher, why did he only pass on the Tongtian Sword Array to you? With you, Lei Yu Ce, by his side, I'll always be a shadow, forever relegated to being a mere accompaniment. This is unfair, and I won't accept it... I won't accept it..."

Wen Zhong repeated "I won't accept it" over and over, his voice hysterical.

"Wen Zhong, you..." Lei Yu Ce's face was filled with pain, and he began to speak.

Dao Yin Zhenren's face was deathly pale, and his expression was even more unsightly. The transparent crystal knife had been stabbed into his abdomen, and he slowly pulled it out, spewing forth a mouthful of blood. His injuries were clearly severe.

Lei Yu Ce's eyes showed concern, and he wanted to continue scolding Wen Zhong, but Dao Yin Zhenren stopped him.

"Wen Zhong has a grudge, and I've known about it for a long time. I've spoken to him privately before, thinking that I had resolved his issues. But it seems he still harbors resentment, which is why he gave that demon an opportunity to strike."

Dao Yin Zhenren wiped the blood from his mouth and spoke.

"Master, what are you talking about?" Lei Yu Ce asked, confused.

"That demon's heart magic specializes in manipulating people's hearts and amplifying their inner demons. Wen Zhong seems to have been affected by it as well."

Dao Yin Zhenren sighed and continued.

Han Li heard these words and felt a chill run down his spine, as if he had realized something.

"Ha ha, ha ha... it's finally resolved, the hatred in my heart for so many years! Today, this knife has finally brought me satisfaction!"

Wen Zhong's laughter grew even more manic, and his face became increasingly twisted.
