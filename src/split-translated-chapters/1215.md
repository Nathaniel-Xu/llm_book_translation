Months later, on a clear morning.

The sun had not yet risen over the city walls, but the streets of Jiyuan City were already bustling with people.

Unlike the usual crowded and hurried pace, today's pedestrians in the city were all relaxed and idle, either chatting in groups of three or five, or leaning against the walls.

These people all had a look of anticipation on their faces, occasionally glancing up at the sky, as if waiting for something.

Among the crowd, a handsome young man in white clothes walked slowly towards the city center, listening to the conversations around him.

He was none other than Han Li, who had changed his appearance and aura with the black mask of the Wheel of Rebirth Hall.

"I heard that this time, the celestial envoy from the Zhongtu Xian Domain is extremely arrogant, with a large entourage and even the head of the Jinsiyuan Xian Palace accompanying him, attracting a lot of attention along the way," said a brown-robed old man.

"Of course, as a celestial envoy from the Heavenly Court, his identity is not ordinary, otherwise why would the head of the Jiyuan Observatory, Pure Jun Zhenren, personally welcome him? Besides, this time he is bringing the 'Bodhi Order', a treasure that many Daluo cultivators covet, who wouldn't be eager to meet him?" said a middle-aged man in elegant clothes.

"That's the proof of attending the Bodhi Banquet, who wouldn't want it?" someone exclaimed.

Han Li just listened, not speaking or stopping, and continued walking towards the end of the street.

"Ah, he's arrived!" someone shouted.

The street immediately erupted into a commotion, with everyone stopping their conversations and looking up at the sky.

The young man in white clothes also stopped, standing at the corner of the street, looking up at the sky.

A dazzling golden light burst forth, like the sun rising, and a seven-colored rainbow appeared, illuminating the surrounding area.

After a moment, the crowd's necks were stiff from looking up, and their eyes were dry, but still, no one appeared.

Just as someone was about to complain, a celestial music sounded from the sky, followed by a colorful light that spread from outside the city, crossing over the city walls and extending into the city.

The city's defensive formations opened a wide path, allowing the light to shine through.

Han Li's eyes narrowed, and he saw that the colorful light had formed a grand road, with five-colored lotus flowers floating on it, emitting a fragrant aroma that enveloped the entire city.

"Rumble, rumble"

A series of thunderous sounds echoed through the air, and on the grand road, eight golden-armored qilins galloped forward, their hooves pounding the ground like thunder.

Behind them, a magnificent carriage was drawn, with intricate carvings and precious stones, looking like a golden palace.

The carriage was followed by a long procession of people, including armored cavalry and celestial cultivators, although the number was not as exaggerated as the rumors.

At the front of the carriage, a high-ranking official stood, wearing a golden crown and a heavenly official's robes, with a proud expression on his face.

Han Li glanced at him, feeling a sense of dislike, and was about to turn away when his eyes fell on the two people behind the official.

One of them was a middle-aged man with an ordinary appearance, wearing a celestial palace robe, who looked like the head of the Jinsiyuan Xian Palace, Lu Chuanfeng.

The other was a stunningly beautiful woman in a red dress, who immediately caught the attention of half the city's population.

"Chimeng, how is it her?" Han Li's eyebrows furrowed in surprise.

As he wondered, a light burst forth in the sky, and a group of people descended, standing on the grand road.

Compared to the celestial envoy's grandeur, these people seemed much more subdued, but their arrival caused the entire city to erupt in cheers and applause.

Han Li looked closely and saw that the leader was a man in a dark green robe, wearing a lotus flower crown, with a ordinary face but a radiant aura.

It was clear that this person was none other than the head of the Jiyuan Observatory, Pure Jun Zhenren.

Behind him stood two other cultivators, one of whom was a thin, elderly man with a high cheekbone and a wispy beard, wearing a ancient-looking gray robe, with an otherworldly aura.

The other was a middle-aged man with a robust build, wearing a purple robe, with a stern expression, looking like a statue of a heavenly king.

Han Li knew that these two men were likely the two vice-heads of the Jiyuan Observatory, Yang Junzi and Lei Jun Zhenren.
Behind the two of them, there were over a dozen people, all of whom had a reverent and respectful demeanor.

Han Li immediately noticed another familiar face among them, which was none other than the Miao Fa Xian Zun who had pursued him in the past.

At this moment, Miao Fa's attention had already shifted past the Tian Xing Xian Zun and was now fixed on the figure of Chi Meng, who was standing behind him. Chi Meng did not back down, and instead glared back at Miao Fa. The two women's gazes collided, and a faint spark of tension seemed to flash between them.

It was clear that the animosity between the two women had been thoroughly established during their previous encounter.

"Welcome, Tian Xing Xian Zun, to the Nine Yuan Guan. We have been remiss in our hospitality." Chun Jun Zhen Ren said with a loud and clear voice.

"Please, do not be so polite, Chun Jun Zhen Ren..."

Han Li saw that the two sides had begun to exchange pleasantries, and immediately lost interest in continuing to watch. Amidst the thunderous applause of the crowd, he pushed his way through and returned to the guesthouse.

As soon as he entered his own courtyard, Han Li saw a tall and stalwart young man, and a young woman dressed in white, wearing a dou gong, standing at the entrance of the courtyard. They seemed to be waiting for him.

As soon as he saw the two of them, Han Li's eyebrows furrowed slightly, and he looked at them without speaking.

"Dragon Five Dao Friend, won't you invite us in for a cup of tea?" the woman in the dou gong suddenly asked with a smile.

"You are Jiao San Dao Friend?" Han Li asked tentatively.

"The Tian Xing Xian Zun has arrived, and I should also inform you of the contents of this mission." the woman in the dou gong said.

"Please, come in."

Han Li no longer hesitated, and walked forward to open the courtyard's seal, welcoming the two of them in.

The three of them entered the house and sat down around the table.

Han Li noticed that the tall and stalwart young man had been gazing at him intently since he entered the courtyard, sizing him up from head to toe without any attempt to conceal his intentions.

"Jiao San Dao Friend, may I ask who this is?" Han Li asked, his curiosity piqued.

"He is one of the vice-hall masters of the Lun Hui Temple, Wu Yang Dao Friend." Jiao San explained.

Han Li's expression changed slightly upon hearing this name.

"It seems that you really do know me." the young man who had been silent until now said.

"I saw your portrait in the Zhen Yan Men ruins, and also heard of you from Re Huo Dao Friend." Han Li said.

"Re Huo... is that scoundrel's disciple?" Wu Yang's expression changed, and he thought for a moment before a hint of anger appeared on his face.

"Dao Friend, please do not be agitated, that Re Huo Dao Friend did not follow Qi Mo Zi in his rebellion, and besides, he has already fallen in the Hui Jie." Han Li quickly said.

"I heard from Gan Jiu Zhen that Qi Mo Zi almost died at your hands?" Wu Yang's expression changed again, and he asked.

Han Li had not heard the name Gan Jiu Zhen in a long time, and it took him a moment to react and connect it to Jiao San. He nodded, and said: "I was lucky enough to defeat him, but unfortunately, I was unable to kill him. So, does the 'Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue' really exist on your person?" Wu Yang suddenly asked.

As soon as he asked this question, the atmosphere in the room became somewhat tense.

"You want it? I can give it to you." Han Li's eyebrows furrowed, and he remained silent for a long time before speaking.

Wu Yang's expression changed slightly, and he seemed to be taken aback by Han Li's straightforwardness.

"This cultivation technique originally belonged to the Zhen Yan Men, and I can only be considered a half-disciple of Mi Luo Lao Zu. You are the true orthodox heir of the Zhen Yan Men, and passing it on to you would be a way of repaying the debt of Mi Luo Lao Zu's teachings." Han Li said calmly.

Wu Yang's eyes flashed with a hint of guilt, and he remained silent for a long time before speaking.

"This 'Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue' you should take good care of, and not let it truly fall into obscurity." Han Li asked in puzzlement.

"Why is that?" Han Li asked.

"Back then, except for the traitor, all the other brothers had died in the line of duty, and only I managed to survive. I can be considered to have betrayed the sect, and besides, I have allowed Qi Mo Zi to roam free for so many years, and was unable to avenge the sect. What qualifications do I have to inherit the 'Da Wu Xing Huan Shi Jue'?" Wu Yang said with a bitter smile.

Han Li tried to persuade him further, but Wu Yang waved his hand and said: "My mind is made up, you do not need to say anything more."

"If that is the case, then the cultivation technique will remain with me for now. If you have a change of heart and wish to rebuild the Zhen Yan Men in the future, I will return it to you then." Han Li could only agree.
