Han Li shook his head and said, "I've been searching for a suitable Corpse Severing Technique for years, but I still haven't found one."

Liu Le'er's face turned pale with anxiety and she said, "That's not possible, without a Corpse Severing Technique, the chances of success are extremely low."

Han Li smiled and said, "Even if the chances are low, I must try my best, otherwise I'll lose even that sliver of possibility."

Liu Le'er glanced around and quickly handed Han Li a jade slip, saying, "I've almost reached the peak of the Great Luo Initial Stage, and Liu Qing, the tribe's elder, has given me a Corpse Severing Technique. I'll let you take a look, maybe it's suitable for you."

Han Li subconsciously grasped the jade slip tightly, but immediately released it and handed it back to Liu Le'er, saying, "Le'er, a Corpse Severing Technique is extremely valuable, how can you casually give it to someone else? If the Tian Huo tribe finds out you've leaked this technique, who knows what punishment you'll face. You should take the jade slip back."

Liu Le'er smiled and said, "Brother, you're not an outsider! This technique doesn't have any restrictive seals, as long as we don't say anything, the Tian Huo tribe won't know. Even if they do find out, I have the true spirit bloodline of the nine-tailed fox, I'm the hope of the Tian Huo tribe's rise to power, they won't do anything to me."

Han Li hesitated for a moment, then nodded and said, "Alright, I won't be polite then."

He grasped the jade slip tightly, and a glimmer of excitement flashed in his eyes.

Liu Le'er said, "Brother, I won't be leaving the Eight Desolations Mountain for long, this time it's because I have the White Emperor's special permission to come here. I'll be heading back soon, you must come visit me when you come to the Barbarian Wilderness."

Han Li silently nodded.

Liu Le'er looked at Han Li again, then her figure flashed and she turned into a grey-white light, shooting off into the distance and disappearing into the horizon.

Han Li watched Liu Le'er leave, then began to examine the contents of the jade slip.

The jade slip began with five large characters: "Split Body Corpse Severing Technique!"

Han Li's heart moved as he read this, and he had some guesses about the contents that followed. However, he didn't get distracted and continued to read.

The contents of the jade slip weren't many, and Han Li quickly finished reading, his face filled with a faint excitement.

This Split Body Corpse Severing Technique was extremely mysterious, and in general, it was about first refining a split body connected to one's heart and soul, then using a secret technique to transfer the evil corpse from one's body to the split body, and finally severing it.

The reason why the three corpses were difficult to sever was because they were connected to one's body and soul, inseparable.

The essence of this Split Body Corpse Severing Technique lay in transferring the three corpses from one's body and sealing them in the split body, thus greatly weakening the connection between the three corpses and one's body, making it much easier to sever them.

However, to use this Corpse Severing Technique, two major requirements had to be met.

Firstly, one's spiritual power had to be strong enough, otherwise they wouldn't be able to withstand the burden of transferring the evil corpse.

Secondly, the split body had to be extremely compatible with one's own body, and the longer the split body was refined, the higher the chances of success.

Han Li withdrew his divine sense from the jade slip, a faint smile on his lips.

This Split Body Corpse Severing Technique was extremely suitable for him, his spiritual power was far beyond that of others of the same stage due to his cultivation of the Spiritual Cultivation Technique, and he definitely met the requirements to use this technique. Moreover, he had a split body that had been refined for many years, the earthy avatar he had created in the Black Wind Sea Domain.

It had been so many years since he had forgotten about that earthy avatar, and now it could be used again.

With the evil thoughts constantly eroding his spiritual power, time was of the essence, and Han Li didn't delay, immediately calling over Jin Tong and Ti Hun, then dismantling the array devices around the cave, preparing to set off towards the North Cold Immortal Domain.

However, just as he was about to leave, he changed his mind and flew towards the Eight Desolations Mountain instead.

Not long after, Han Li stopped his flying technique a thousand miles away from the Eight Desolations Mountain and bowed respectfully.

"Ha ha, Han Xiao, are you leaving now?" A white shadow flashed in front of Han Li, and Bai Ze's figure appeared, smiling as he spoke.

Han Li bowed again and said, "Yes, I have an urgent matter to attend to, thank you, Bai Ze, for your care. I've come to bid farewell."

Bai Ze looked at Han Li and said, "It's nothing, don't mention it. You're going to take action now, you must hurry, the evil thoughts are affecting your spiritual power."

Han Li said, "Bai Ze, you're wise, it's indeed so. However, the road ahead is uncertain, and I'm not confident of success. If I fail, please take care of Xiao Bai and the Tian Huo tribe's Liu Le'er."

Bai Ze nodded and said, "Of course, I'll take care of them. Where are you planning to go?"

Han Li wondered what Bai Ze meant by this, but Bai Ze smiled and said, "Don't misunderstand, I'm not trying to pry into your business. If you're going somewhere not too far, I can have Yue Meng send you there with his 'Tour Heaven Divine Technique'."

Han Li realized his mistake and bowed, saying, "I apologize for the misunderstanding, I'm actually planning to go to the North Cold Immortal Domain."

Bai Ze's eyebrows moved, and he turned to the empty space beside him, saying, "Yue Meng, can your 'Tour Heaven Divine Technique' send Han Xiao to the North Cold Immortal Domain?"
Chapter:

"It's just a short distance, of course I can." The air rippled and Yue Mian's figure appeared.

"Then I'll have to trouble you to take action once, Han Xiao is currently being pursued by the Heavenly Court, it's very inconvenient for him to travel." Bai Ze said.

"Thank you, Bai Ze and Yue Mian." Han Li was grateful for their assistance, although he didn't know what "You Tian Shentong" meant.

"Enough with the thanks, I'm sick of it. Han Xiao, get ready." Yue Mian's eyes flashed with impatience as he waved his sleeve.

A ball of green light shot out from his sleeve, rapidly growing ten times larger and transforming into a half-transparent green giant bird. It flew towards Han Li, swallowing him whole in an instant.

The giant bird's wings spread wide, tearing through space with a loud "whoosh" as it disappeared into the void.

The series of changes happened in the blink of an eye, Han Li was unable to react in time.

When he came to, he found himself inside the giant bird's body, surrounded by a chaotic flow of energy. The bird's body was covered in complex spirit patterns, forming a cloud-like design. The edges of its body were adorned with green symbols that seemed to flow like water, surrounding the bird as it flew rapidly.

The surrounding void was torn apart by the bird's body, unable to block its progress.

Han Li was trapped inside the bird's stomach, unable to move due to the immense power surrounding him.

He didn't try to escape, instead curiously looking around. The giant bird's speed was incredible, far surpassing his own.

After around ten hours, the giant bird's wings shook, and it burst out of the void, tearing through the air and appearing above a dense forest.

With a soft "boom", the giant bird shattered, dispersing into countless green lights.

Han Li's restraints were released, and he stood firm in mid-air, his body glowing with golden light.

He expanded his divine sense, surveying his surroundings, and soon a look of joy appeared on his face. He transformed into a golden light and flew towards the distance.

A moment later, Han Li stopped near a city situated on a hill.

The city was not large, with the words "Ming Qiu City" written in golden characters on the gate.

Although Han Li had never been here before, he had heard of it on his way to Zu Long Dao from the Black Wind Sea. It was a city on the barren wasteland continent.

"Amazing, he really brought me here in one go. This divine ability is truly extraordinary." Han Li muttered to himself, filled with reverence for the Dao Ancestor's divine ability.

The distance between the Eight Desolate Mountains and the North Cold Immortal Domain was unknown, but if he had to travel alone, it would take him at least a hundred years. Yue Mian's wave of his hand had brought him here in just one day.

Han Li collected his thoughts, bowed in the direction of the Eight Desolate Mountains, and then turned to fly towards the Black Wind Sea.

...

In the North Cold Immortal Domain, the Black Wind Sea.

A vast expanse of blue sea stretched out, with a gentle breeze blowing across the waves.

In the distance, one could see streams of light flying through the air, as cultivators in colorful robes flew towards a lush island in the center of the sea.

The island was not large, but it was surrounded by a series of array formations, forming a chain of seven islands.

From afar, one could see a massive human statue standing on the island, its hands open wide as if embracing the heavens.

At this moment, the morning sun had just risen, and the island's central square was filled with tens of thousands of islanders, who had just finished a prayer ceremony and were slowly dispersing.

As the sound of rushing wind echoed through the air, many people looked up, but most didn't pay attention, seeming to be accustomed to such scenes.

Among them was an old man with white hair, dark skin, and sleeves rolled up high. He was holding a small, dark-skinned child with a proud expression.

"Little Tiger, look! Thanks to our ancestral deity's blessings, the surrounding islands have all submitted to our Wu Meng Island. Their tribe leaders come to pay homage every year on this day. We're quite impressive, aren't we?" The old man chuckled.

The child looked up at him with a curious expression, and the old man smiled, his eyes filled with satisfaction.
