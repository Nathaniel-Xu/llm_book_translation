A moment later, Han Li and the others arrived at the foot of a massive palace situated on the mid-slope of a mountain. The palace's signboard read "Jiuyuan Pavilion" in three large characters.

"Please, fellow Daoists," their guide said, inviting the Xianshan Sect group to enter the grand hall.

From the outside, the Jiuyuan Pavilion didn't seem particularly large, but its interior space was surprisingly vast, spanning over a thousand meters. It was clear that some kind of spatial material and method had been used in its construction.

At this moment, several sect members had already arrived, and upon seeing the Xianshan Sect group enter, some familiar faces approached to greet them.

Due to Han Li's impressive display of power during the previous duel, some people took the initiative to strike up a conversation with him. Fortunately, Han Li was already familiar with their identities and relationships, so he was able to respond with ease.

Half an hour later, the twelve outstanding sect members had all arrived, while the other sect members had not appeared.

After a brief moment, the sound of bells and drums echoed from the grand hall.

The crowd immediately fell silent, and from the rear hall, Feng Tian Xian Shi, Chun Jun Zhen Ren, Lu Chuan Feng, Huo Yuan, and Tian Xing Zun Zhe emerged.

Behind Chun Jun Zhen Ren, several Jiuyuan Pavilion elders followed, but Chi Meng was not among them. This caused Han Li to feel a slight sense of relief.

"Greetings, Feng Tian Xian Shi! Chun Jun Zhen Ren!" the crowd chorused, bowing in unison.

"No need for formalities," Chun Jun Zhen Ren said with a smile. "Let's get straight to the point. Today, I've invited you all to confer the Bodhi Decree. The winners of the previous duel, please come forward."

Han Li and the other twelve individuals stepped forward from their respective sect groups, standing in a line before Chun Jun Zhen Ren and Feng Tian Xian Shi.

Chun Jun Zhen Ren stepped aside, and Feng Tian Xian Shi took a step forward, bowing to the empty air. "I respectfully request the Bodhi Decree!"

As he spoke, a dazzling golden light burst forth from the void, and a golden, square-shaped treasure box materialized.

Feng Tian Xian Shi bowed to the treasure box, then snapped his fingers, and the box opened automatically. Inside, twelve golden, ancient Bodhi Decrees were arranged, emitting a peculiar aura that seemed to contain some kind of extraordinary energy.

The crowd's faces lit up with excitement as they gazed upon the Bodhi Decrees.

Han Li's eyes merely swept over the twelve Bodhi Decrees, his expression revealing a hint of excitement. However, he didn't place much importance on these highly coveted tokens among the high-ranking cultivators of the Jin Tong Yuan.

His true purpose for coming here was to gather information about Jintong. Now that he was one step away from completing the Wheel of Rebirth Temple's task, he would soon need to consider how to launch a rescue mission.

For someone with his current cultivation level, the Jiuyuan Pavilion was akin to a dragon's lair, making it impossible to force his way in. The ideal situation would be to take advantage of the chaos during the Wheel of Rebirth Temple's action to fish in troubled waters.

However, he still didn't understand the purpose of the Wheel of Rebirth Temple's action, nor did he know if he would have an opportunity to take advantage of the situation.

As Han Li pondered these thoughts, Feng Tian Xian Shi snapped his fingers again, and the twelve Bodhi Decrees flew out of the treasure box, landing in the hands of Han Li and the others.

Han Li accepted the Bodhi Decree with one hand, feeling a slight stir in his heart.

The Bodhi Decree was extremely heavy, and its material was unknown. It felt ice-cold to the touch, and when Han Li made contact with it, he could sense the peculiar energy contained within.

"The Bodhi Decree is a treasure forged by the Time Dao Ancestor himself," Feng Tian Xian Shi said slowly. "With this decree, you will be able to participate in the upcoming Bodhi Banquet. Please, everyone, take good care of it."

Han Li was about to examine the Bodhi Decree further when he heard that it was forged by the Time Dao Ancestor. He immediately stopped, feeling an urge to discard the decree.

"This Bodhi Banquet will be held in the Yaochi Victory Realm," Feng Tian Xian Shi continued. "With this decree, you may bring three people to attend. As for what you can gain from the Bodhi Banquet, that depends on your individual luck."

Just then, a sudden, thunderous roar echoed from a distant location outside the pavilion.

The expressions of the Jiuyuan Pavilion elders changed, and Chun Jun Zhen Ren's brow furrowed slightly as he cast a questioning glance at a stout, bearded elder beside him.

The elder closed his eyes, pointed his fingers at his brow, and began to chant. A golden light swirled around his brow, and a powerful spiritual energy fluctuation emanated from it, seemingly a unique method of spiritual transmission.

After a moment, the elder opened his eyes and said, "Something has gone wrong at the Spirit Beast Mountain's beast enclosure. The mountain's guardian beast, the Bieyan Qilin, has been startled and has broken free, rampaging through the mountain."

"The Bieyan Qilin is a Mahayana-level guardian beast, known for its gentle nature," Chun Jun Zhen Ren said calmly. "Why would it suddenly go berserk? Where is Shanyang Zhenren? Isn't he the one responsible for its care?"

The elder replied, "Shanyang Zhenren has gone to the lower realm to subdue a ferocious beast that has been wreaking havoc in the Shan Yuan Realm. He has not returned yet."

As the elder finished speaking, the commotion outside grew louder, with various spirit beasts and exotic birds crying out in the distance, their sounds echoing through the air.

The stout elder closed his eyes to inquire further, his expression growing increasingly tense.
The mountain master, the beast enclosures on the Spiritual Beast Mountain were all damaged by the Biyan Qilin, and more than 70 spiritual beasts escaped and went on a rampage. Many of them used their innate divine abilities to break out of the Spiritual Beast Mountain, and two of them even reached the Jiaohu Garden. Fortunately, Mu Rong Elder stopped them, or else the spiritual plants and grasses would have been severely damaged.

Today, the temple is hosting noble guests, and we cannot be careless. Let's have Lei Jun Elder handle it personally.

The short and stout elder nodded and began to transmit a message.

There's been a bit of a situation inside, please forgive us. Chun Jun True Person turned to Feng Tian Xian Shi and the others, and smiled.

No need to worry, it's just a few spiritual beasts escaping. We'll just catch them and that's all. Feng Tian Xian Shi said nonchalantly.

It's not a big deal... Tian Xing Zun and the others also laughed and spoke.

As for the 12 people from the various sects who came to receive the Bodhi Order, they naturally didn't dare to say a word, and could only sit at the lower seats and accompany them with a smile.

Just as everyone thought the ceremony was over and they could leave, a loud explosion was heard from outside the Nine Yuan Tower, and the entire great hall shook violently.

Immediately after, a series of loud explosions followed.

The sound was far away, but the momentum was not small, and it didn't seem like the sound of spiritual beasts.

What's going on? Chun Jun True Person's expression finally changed, and he asked.

The short and stout elder used his divine soul secret technique to investigate again, but he didn't speak directly, and instead transmitted a message to Chun Jun True Person.

After hearing the message, Chun Jun True Person's face was slightly tense, and a hint of anger appeared between his eyebrows.

Feng Tian Xian Shi, Huo Dao Friend, Lu Gong Zhu, Tian Xing Dao Friend, there are some matters in the temple that require my personal attention. I'll trouble you all to wait for a moment. Chun Jun True Person stood up, bowed to the few people, and said.

Since the temple has matters to attend to, then Chun Jun Dao Friend can go and handle them. We'll just drink some tea and wait. Huo Yuan stood up and said.

Chun Jun Dao Friend can go and handle the matters, no need to worry. The others also stood up and said.

Chun Jun True Person stood up, turned his wrist, and took out a silver silk duster. With a casual wave, a layer of silver ripples appeared in front of him, and a door to a silver space appeared in the void.

Han Li watched and saw that Chun Jun True Person's cultivation was not a space law, and he was able to create a silver space door with a single wave of his hand. The silver silk duster in his hand was definitely a rare and precious space treasure.

Yu Chang, you stay here and entertain the noble guests. I'll go and come back. Chun Jun True Person instructed the short and stout elder.

Then, he retreated and disappeared into the silver ripples.

Feng Tian Xian Shi and the others sat back down, and occasionally chatted and drank tea. Zhou Xian Yang and the others from the 12 sects looked at each other, and some of them were getting anxious.

Everyone, don't worry, the temple master will be back soon. You can just wait here for a moment. The short and stout elder saw the situation and spoke to comfort them.

The 12 sects' people naturally didn't dare to have any objections, and could only sit down and wait.

After about a cup of tea, Chun Jun True Person still hadn't returned.

Is the noise outside because of something happening on that side? Han Li asked Zhou Xian Yang in a transmitted voice.

Our task is just to receive the Bodhi Order, and we don't know anything about the other matters. We don't need to worry about it. Zhou Xian Yang replied in a transmitted voice.

Han Li heard this and knew that he couldn't ask anything else, so he didn't say anything more.

But just then, a loud explosion was heard, and the great hall shook violently. The furniture and decorations were all knocked over, and many people were affected by the shockwave, stumbling and almost falling over.

What's going on... Tian You Lake's Zi Luo Xian Zi's expression changed, and she asked.

The others' expressions also changed, and they all felt the power of the explosion. What made them even more anxious was that this explosion didn't come from far away, but from the Nine Yuan Tower itself.

Han Li looked around and saw that the floor, walls, and ceiling all had a layer of golden light, and inside the light, there were complex and intricate talisman arrays. It was clear that this was a high-level banishment array.

Everyone, don't worry, this Nine Yuan Tower is our sect's stronghold, and it's naturally protected by an independent banishment array. Even a mid-stage Da Luo cultivator wouldn't be able to break through it easily, let alone be harmed by the escaped spiritual beasts. Yu Chang said hastily.

But just as he finished speaking, another explosion sounded, and the great hall shook violently again.

The golden talisman arrays surrounding the great hall also shook violently, and the surface of the arrays lit up with a brilliant golden light, stabilizing the great hall once again.

This time, everyone realized that the situation was not quite right, and some people even showed signs of panic.

Only Feng Tian Xian Shi and the others remained calm and composed, chatting and drinking tea as if the situation outside had nothing to do with them.
