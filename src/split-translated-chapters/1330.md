Since it's come to this, it's time for you to pay the price for your actions. Han Li's eyes gleamed with cold light, his clothes rustling without any wind. With a loud "Boom", he erupted with a burst of golden light, easily piercing through the cave above him once more. The powerful Time Law burst forth from the golden light.

"Time Law!" Feng Qing Shui's face revealed a shocked expression, as he rapidly retreated backwards, his hands sweeping out in a gesture.

The air in front of him began to hum, and countless blue light threads appeared, densely packed and flashing with terrifying blue lightning. It was as if a blue ocean had unfolded, rolling towards Han Li with overwhelming force.

Han Li let out a cold laugh, his body's golden light fluctuating wildly. In an instant, he transformed into a golden rainbow, disappearing with a few residual shadows, his speed beyond imagination.

Feng Qing Shui's body behind him rippled, and the golden rainbow reappeared, transforming back into Han Li's body.

The blue light threads all snapped, and Feng Qing Shui's body revealed a rift from head to toe.

Then, with a soft "Puff", Feng Qing Shui's body split into two halves, but no blood appeared.

Immediately, his two halves "Banged" open, exploding into two blue water vapors that shot out towards the distance, merging into one another.

The blue light flashed, and Feng Qing Shui's body reappeared, his face slightly pale.

But he merely took a deep breath, and his face returned to normal.

"Who are you, exactly? This kind of Time Law... you're a remnant of the True Words Sect!" Feng Qing Shui roared.

"You're very intelligent, but people who are too intelligent often don't live very long." Han Li spoke, his body's golden light surging once more, as he instantaneously opened his spiritual domain to envelop Feng Qing Shui.

Within the golden domain, the True Words Treasure Wheel flashed, transforming into a golden circular moon that rapidly spun, filling the entire spiritual domain with countless golden ripples.

Feng Qing Shui's entire body froze, as if he had been petrified.

Han Li's eyes turned cold, and he punched out.

Five Time Law forces surged forth, gathering together, but instead of forming the Five Elements Illusory Realm, they transformed into a golden fist, striking Feng Qing Shui with the force of a shooting star.

The five Time Law forces within the fist clashed intensely, yet didn't completely explode, releasing a wildly violent power that seemed unstoppable.

This was a divine ability that Han Li had recently created, after gaining a deeper understanding of the Time Law, which he called the "Great Five Elements Annihilation".

With a loud "Boom", Feng Qing Shui's body exploded, turning into a bloody rain.

Not only that, but a golden sun with a diameter of hundreds of millions of miles appeared, centered around Feng Qing Shui. The golden sun contained Time Law forces that rolled and killed everything.

Everything within the hundreds of millions of miles, including space, matter, and even time, was reduced to nothingness.

Feng Qing Shui's exploded flesh and blood were also consumed by the golden sun, becoming nothingness.

The explosive fist's power scattered, and the sea domain was turned upside down. The Misty Dragon Secret Realm's various locations revealed massive cracks, before collapsing with a loud crash.

The Misty Dragon Sect's upper airspace violently flashed, before shattering, as endless seawater appeared, covering the Misty Dragon Sect, and even half of the Tianhai Continent.

The blue fiery sun also appeared, still radiating blue light.

The dragons within the sea trembled, but didn't dare to fly out, hiding in the water instead.

Although these dragons were proud and looked down on any other tribe, they still had deep reverence for a Dao Ancestor-level existence.

The seawater poured down, threatening to engulf the entire continent.

The Misty Dragon Sect's countless disciples saw the sky's scene, their faces filled with terror, as they fell into chaos.

The three Ji-surnamed youths looked up at the sky, their faces also filled with shock.

The three of them hastily flew up, forming seals and casting spells, as their bodies radiated brilliant blue light, enveloping the Misty Dragon Sect, and holding back the seawater.

The residents of the Misty Dragon City, and even the entire Tianhai Continent, could only stand by and await their fate in the face of this catastrophic seawater.

Han Li's figure appeared above the Misty Dragon Sect, his brow furrowed as he took in the scene.

"Heaven and Earth's cycle, Yin and Yang's five elements, calm the waters!" Han Li raised his hand, pointing, as his voice boomed.

His voice grew louder with each word, until it transformed into a massive sound wave, echoing throughout the Dragon Abyss Divine Realm.

At this moment, his voice was cold and emotionless, completely devoid of feelings, as if it was the voice of the heavens.

The entire Dragon Abyss Divine Realm was instantly filled with endless blue light, as all the seawater, clouds, and water-attribute primal energies froze in place.

The Misty Dragon Secret Realm's pouring seawater also froze in mid-air, unmoving, as if it had solidified into a massive water sphere.

"Move!" Han Li's hands swept out.

The massive water sphere let out a deafening roar, as it horizontally flew towards the sea.

The three Ji-surnamed youths were caught off guard, their mouths spraying blood as they were enveloped by the water sphere.

The water sphere flew out of the Tianhai Continent, and into the sea, in the blink of an eye.

Han Li's hands, which had been forming a seal, dropped, and the blue light that filled the divine realm instantly dissipated, as everything returned to normal.

Rumbling sounds echoed...
The massive water sphere hovering in the air crashed into the sea, producing a thunderous roar and stirring up countless towering waves.

The dragon clan members in the water quickly fled in all directions, their movements frantic and panicked, vanishing into the distance in an instant.

Han Li appeared on the surface of the water, his face expressionless, with no hint of joy or excitement. Instead, he wore a thoughtful and contemplative look.

Although he was confident in his time law, which had allowed him to effortlessly kill Feng Qingyu, he couldn't help but feel that something was off.

Feng Qingyu, after all, was a powerful being who had spent years mastering the water law, and was one of the strongest in the entire True Immortal Realm. Moreover, he was not a mere illusion or a divine avatar, but a flesh-and-blood being.

Han Li's eyes flashed, and his vast divine sense expanded, permeating the void.

At that moment, a massive explosion shook the skies above the Tianhai Continent, and a network of golden lightning bolts appeared in the distance.

Han Li turned his head, his body flashing with lightning, and he vanished in an instant.

A golden lightning sword appeared, and countless golden lightning balls shot out from it, striking the void in front of it.

Each lightning ball contained a powerful law that rivaled the previous sword array's attack, and its power was at least a hundred times greater.

The thunderous explosion shook the skies, and the void within a radius of tens of thousands of miles was shattered, reduced to nothingness.

A figure was flung out of the void, and it was Feng Qingyu. He stumbled, his face pale, and his breathing labored.

Han Li's figure reappeared, his voice cold and detached. "You actually managed to deceive me with your divine avatar. However, I have already set up a heavenly net, and you will not escape today!"

A massive golden spirit domain appeared, its power unlike anything that had come before. It twisted and distorted the void, causing the space to writhe and contort.

Han Li's hands formed a seal, and the spirit domain responded, producing a series of massive golden gates that connected to various immortal realms and lower planes.

The largest gate was the most magnificent, and it led to a boundless space filled with golden light â€“ the heavenly time law that had appeared when Han Li had advanced to the late stage of the Mahayana.

Han Li's hands moved, and the gates shone brightly, as time laws from various realms and planes flowed into the spirit domain.

The time laws in those realms and planes became chaotic, and the spiritual energy of the heavens and earth fluctuated wildly. The winds howled, and the thunder boomed, as if the end of the world had arrived.

The time law in the Longyuan Immortal Realm was drawn towards the golden spirit domain, causing the entire realm to become turbulent and chaotic.

The gate connected to the heavenly time law also shone brightly, as a massive golden light descended, pouring into the spirit domain.

The golden spirit domain expanded, its power surging, and it released a boundless golden light that obscured the sun. The power continued to rise, pressing down on Feng Qingyu.

Feng Qingyu's face turned pale, and he let out a loud roar. A massive blue spirit domain appeared, filled with misty energy and strange, flickering lights that seemed to mesmerize and disorient.

The blue spirit domain produced a series of spatial gates, attempting to connect to various immortal realms and planes, and borrow their power.

However, at that moment, a massive golden lightning net appeared, covering the Tianhai Continent. The net was so large that it seemed to isolate the surrounding void.

Feng Qingyu's spatial gates were filled with chaotic energy, and only golden lightning bolts could be seen.

His face changed, and he knew that he was in a desperate situation.

The golden spirit domain descended, its power crushing, and Feng Qingyu's body stiffened, unable to move.

He roared, and his blue spirit domain responded, borrowing some of the water's primordial energy from the sea below.

The blue spirit domain shone brightly, and it clashed with the golden spirit domain.

The two colors intertwined, producing a massive explosion that shook the heavens and the earth.

This was a battle between laws, a clash of rules, and a struggle for the great dao.

However, the time law, as one of the three supreme laws of the True Immortal Realm, was the closest to the fundamental laws of the universe. How could the water law possibly resist it?

In an instant, the Longyuan Immortal Realm was thrown into chaos, and the skies seemed to collapse. The seas churned, and the earth cracked.

Massive spatial rifts appeared, stretching across the realm, and the seas poured into them. The edges of the realm were torn apart, and the smaller, fragmented realms were swallowed by the void, plummeting towards the lower planes.

Fortunately, the Longyuan Immortal Realm was mostly composed of endless oceans, and despite the chaos, there were few casualties.

The blue spirit domain was crushed by the golden spirit domain, and it shattered into countless pieces, its fragments exploding like eggs.
