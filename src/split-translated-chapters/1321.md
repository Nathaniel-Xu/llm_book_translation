In the Mortal Realm, Southern Sea.

On the Southern Glance Continent, one of the Mortal Realm's landmasses, there was a mountain range that stretched for tens of thousands of miles along the coast, with 98 volcanoes scattered throughout, all of which were active.

These volcanoes would erupt every hundred years or so, attracting countless scattered cultivators and smaller sects from all over the Southern Glance Continent to gather and watch.

Of course, these people weren't just there to sightsee, but also to try their luck and see if they could find a rare material called "Fire Refining Stone" among the lava and rocks spewed out by the volcanoes.

In the past, the Heavenly Court had always turned a blind eye to this, allowing these cultivators to rely on their luck to gain a chance at ascending to the heavens. However, this year's situation was different.

According to predictions, 17 volcanoes were supposed to erupt simultaneously, but just as they were about to erupt, the Heavenly Ambassadors from the Southern Glance Continent's Heavenly Tower intervened, diverting the volcanic energy into the Western Sea, preventing the eruption.

The scattered cultivators and smaller sects on the continent didn't seem to mind, as they were all busy preparing for the biggest gathering in the True Immortal Realm - the "Bodhi Banquet".

In the mountain range of the 98 volcanoes, there was a very important location belonging to the Heavenly Court, a place called the "Heavenly Gate". This gate was the southern entrance to the Mortal Realm, and was also known as the "Southern Heavenly Gate".

This gate was actually a massive transmission array, with tens of thousands of smaller transmission arrays built into it, connecting the 36 major domains of the True Immortal Realm. It was capable of transmitting tens of thousands of people at once.

When the gate was opened, it would create a spatial tunnel connecting the other 35 major domains, allowing for free travel between them.

In fact, there were three more gates like this, each located in a different part of the Mortal Realm.

The Mortal Realm was the core of the True Immortal Realm, with nine provinces and four seas. Each province was a vast landmass, separated from the others by the four great oceans.

The Heavenly Palace Continent was located at the center of the nine provinces and four seas, and was the seat of the Heavenly Court. The other continents were the Eastern Victory Continent, the Western Heng Continent, the Southern Glance Continent, and the Northern Ku Continent.

Each of the four continents had its own Heavenly Tower and Heavenly Gate, with each gate being a portal to other domains, guarded by Heavenly Generals. Each Heavenly Tower was the core of its respective domain, with Dao Ancestor-level cultivators stationed there to guard it.

As the Bodhi Banquet approached, cultivators from all over the True Immortal Realm were gathering in the Mortal Realm, eager to participate in the festivities. Many were hoping to gain a chance to ascend to the heavens, while others were simply there to enjoy the festivities and perhaps gain some benefits.

The Bodhi Banquet was being held on the Heavenly Palace Continent, but the other continents were also hosting their own smaller gatherings. Rare and exotic treasures from all over the True Immortal Realm would be gathered there, and various appraisal and auction events would be held.

Who wouldn't want to take advantage of this opportunity to gain a windfall?

However, the Heavenly Court was also under a lot of pressure to prepare for the banquet, as the Mortal Realm would be flooded with tens of thousands of cultivators from all over the True Immortal Realm. Even with the strictest defenses, there was no guarantee that no one would slip through the cracks.

...

In the distant Snowy Plains of the Beast Realm, a massive, crimson-red spiritual domain enveloped the snowy wasteland, casting a reddish glow over the entire area. The snowflakes that fell from the sky were instantly evaporated by the scorching heat emanating from the domain, leaving behind only a barren, charred landscape.

In the center of the domain, a massive, deep pit stretched out for tens of thousands of meters, with a corpse lying at the bottom. The corpse was that of a powerful, wolf-like demon cultivator, clad in bronze armor, with only half of its head remaining. The golden blood flowing from its wounds was a testament to its high cultivation level.

The demon's face was still recognizable, despite being severely disfigured. It was clear that it had been brutally slaughtered.

This demon was actually the Patriarch of the Beast Realm's most powerful demon sect, the Wan Yao Cave, and had been at the mid-stage of the Da Luo Realm.

It had been preparing to attend the Bodhi Banquet, along with several of its disciples, but was ambushed on the way to the transmission array. The demon's body had been left relatively intact, but its disciples had been completely annihilated.

A loud, dull thud echoed through the air.

A tall, muscular man with red hair and a chiseled face appeared at the edge of the pit, his eyes fixed on the demon's corpse. His skin was covered in fiery, crimson-red marks, and his aura was so intense that it seemed to burn the air around him.

He was the one who had killed the demon, and his gaze was fixed intently on the corpse.
He bent down and picked up a Bodhi Command from the side of the demon cultivator, rubbed off the bloodstains, and let out a sneer as he tossed it behind him.

A woman in a black skirt holding a Luo umbrella caught it at the edge of the giant pit, examined it briefly, and then put it away.

The woman's figure was slender and elegant, her skin as white as sheep's fat jade, and her face was breathtakingly beautiful. However, her long hair covered half of her face, revealing only a corner of her cheek, which had a visible fish-scale scar.

"Inferno, you've killed the person and taken the thing, we can leave now," the woman said in a melodious voice. "According to the Lord's instructions, this war dog is only a killable but not a must-kill target. It's that Tong Qiu True Person who is our real target."

"Got it," the red-haired man replied, still focused on removing a storage cuff from the war dog's arm. He jumped out of the pit and flew away.

"Sometimes your temper is really stubborn, insisting on coming here," the woman said with a sigh.

"Killing him is also a warning to Tong Qiu, he won't be going to the Middle Earth Immortal Domain immediately. But it's better this way, we can kill him at the mountain gate instead of searching for him on the road," Inferno said.

"I only care about getting Tong Qiu's head, the rest is up to you. The Lord said that this is the first time all eight of us are acting together, so we should make a big scene," the woman, called "Xuan Yu", said casually.

"Got it," Inferno replied expressionlessly.

"Let's go," Xuan Yu said.

The two of them jumped into the air and flew away, disappearing into the distance.

The spiritual realm that had been covering the wasteland also disappeared, and the snow fell heavily once again, covering the earth.

Such a typical ambush and sect assassination were being played out in many immortal domains, with some succeeding and others failing. However, in the end, it was the person being assassinated who died more often.

It was unknown why, but the death of a top strongman in a major immortal domain, which would normally cause a huge stir, was now like throwing a stone into the sea, barely causing any ripples.

Most immortal domains were still filled with the excitement of the "Bodhi Banquet", but beneath the surface, the undercurrents were already surging, and the situation was becoming increasingly complex.

...

At the same time, in a mysterious and unknown immortal domain, there was a giant gourd-shaped valley filled with miasma, where corpses were scattered everywhere, and ghostly flames danced in the air.

From the entrance of the valley to the depths, one could see the scattered remains of various beasts and humans, including the bones of ordinary animals, the carcasses of powerful demons, and the remains of immortal cultivators, some of which still emitted a fierce aura.

In the depths of the valley, the miasma grew thicker, and the sound of "dong dong dong" echoed through the air.

Through the thick fog, one could see a giant, eerie rock at the center of the valley, where a beautiful girl in a yellow goose- feather cloak sat cross-legged, her mouth still holding a stalk of grass.

The girl was none other than Jin Tong, who had left Han Li and come to this place alone.

At this moment, she was holding a long bone, possibly from a demon, and was tapping it against the rock.

"Hey, I've been searching for you for so long, and you're still hiding and not coming out. You're the last great demon of the True Immortal Realm, aside from me. If I devour you, our Dao Ancestor's position will be restored soon. Don't you want to take revenge? Do you want to spend your whole life hiding here, eating garbage?"

The rock remained motionless, and the valley was silent, except for the sound of Jin Tong's tapping.

"Fine, I'll make it easy for you," Jin Tong said, her eyes flashing with a fierce light.

As she spoke, she suddenly jumped up and threw the long bone at the rock, unleashing a powerful gust of wind and a bolt of lightning that struck the rock with a loud "boom".

The rock exploded into fragments, and a golden light shot out, followed by a giant golden beetle that flew out of the rock and soared into the sky.

"Where are you going?"

Jin Tong let out a low growl, and her body burst into a golden light as she transformed into a giant golden beetle, engaging in a fierce battle with the other beetle.

The two beetles clashed in mid-air, their auras intertwined, and the space around them began to distort. The battle raged on, with the outcome uncertain.
